<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/242008373370188.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936903/byc-says-it-wants-to-continue-its-peaceful-protest-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>BYC says it wants to continue its ‘peaceful protest’ in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) on Sunday stated that it will continue its “peaceful” Islamabad sit-in, now in its 40th day, a press release from the group said.
The Islamabad sit-in began on July 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Its chief, Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting violence, a day after police cracked down on their protest.
According to the press release, available with Dawn.com, the group, during a press conference in Islamabad, expressed its willingness to continue the ongoing sit-in in the federal capital, stating that “one day these institutions will be forced to listen to our voice”.
“This protest is not just a protest of the Baloch people, it is a protest for justice,” the press release read. “This is a fight for human dignity and truth and it is the duty of all of us to support this fight.”
 






The statement read that the demonstrators had two demands: the release of Dr Mahrang and BYC activists Beebarg Baloch, Shaji Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, among others, and the recovery of “all the forcibly disappeared persons” in Balochistan.
“We make it clear that Dr Mahrang Baloch and her associates are peaceful political activists and political prisoners, but under a systematic plan, they are being presented as terrorists so that the real voice of the Baloch nation can be suppressed,” the statement read.
“These demands are not the desire of any specific group but the voice of the collective conscience of society.”
Indirectly addressing journalists, the BYC’s statement regretted that the media and courts are “unable to fulfil their basic responsibilities”.
 
 

“The media distorts our legitimate and straightforward demands,” the statement read. “It was hoped that the courts would provide justice to the oppressed, but they are only strengthening oppression by repeatedly extending remand.”
The BYC noted that after a total of 45 days of remand, when the group’s leaders appeared in court on Friday, further remand was sought again on the same FIRs.
“Our lawyers insisted on not granting remand, on which the court rejected the remand in these FIRs and discharged them,” the statement read. “However, by bringing five new, baseless FIRs, the BYC leaders have been sent on remand for another 15 days.”
“We will continue our protest peacefully. We know that no matter how long the oppression lasts, it will not last forever,” the statement added. “We appeal to the people of the entire country, civil society, human rights institutions and the international community to stand with us.”
The BYC said it will expand its protest in the coming days, warning that it would take “strict action, the consequences of which will be the responsibility of the state itself”. Neither the action nor the consequences were elaborated upon in the statement.
“We want to make it clear that our protest is peaceful, will remain peaceful and we will not leave this place until our loved ones are released,” the BYC stated. “We stand by our demands, we will continue our struggle.”
BYC, a Baloch advocacy group active since 2018, has been campaigning against enforced disappearances.
Friday’s remand extension was the fourth time the BYC leaders have been presented before the court since their arrest. Initially, they were detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (3MPO). Following the expiry of their MPO detention, terrorism-related charges were filed against them.
A day earlier, Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah elaborated on the difficulties judges faced regarding cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances in the face of non-cooperation by the state and lawmakers.
He said that when he ordered that disappearances be investigated or missing people be found, “the authorities would come and they would all say that we don’t know where they are”. At this, the judge pointed out: “The judge and the court cannot do anything when you don’t have independent investigators.”
Minallah said that during the four years he served as the Islamabad High Court’s chief justice, students from Balochistan would approach the court about disappearances in the province.
“When the Balochistan students came, I didn’t know what to do because it was out of my jurisdiction. The investigations had to take place in Balochistan. But the law did provide me with that jurisdiction.”
Earlier this year, former PPP senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar warned against labelling Dr Mahrang, the BYC, or anyone “a terrorist” without evidence or trial, terming such statements “extremely problematic” that could “backfire”.</p><small>2025-08-24 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24212606d949732.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936882/zelensky-says-presence-of-foreign-troops-after-war-is-important-for-ukraine' target='_blank'><strong>Zelensky says presence of foreign troops after war is ‘important’ for Ukraine</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine after the war with Russia ends was “important” as Kyiv seeks to work on potential security guarantees with its Western allies.
The issue of on-the-ground “presence, as they say, boots on the ground, is important to us,” Zelensky said, speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who visited Kyiv as it celebrated Ukrainian Independence Day against a backdrop of fading hopes for recent peace efforts.
Carney said earlier that it was not up to Russia to decide on potential security guarantees for Ukraine that Kyiv seeks from Western allies for when the war ends.
“It’s not the choice of Russia how the future sovereignty, independence and liberty of Ukraine is guaranteed. It’s the choice of Ukraine and the decisions of the partners,” Carney told reporters on his visit to Kyiv.
Earlier today, Ukraine launched a wave of drone strikes on Russia, triggering a fire at a nuclear power plant.
After a flurry of diplomacy and a push by US President Donald Trump to broker a summit between his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, the prospects for peace appeared to stall on Friday when Russia ruled out any immediate meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky.
 


The three-and-a-half-year war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, has ground to a virtual stalemate, though Russia has managed to eke out recent advances in a grinding offensive  — including claiming two villages in the eastern Donetsk region Saturday.
Ukraine hit back Sunday by sending drones on fresh attacks on Russian territory, including one that was shot down over the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in western Russia, which detonated upon impact and sparked a fire, according to the facility.
The plant said the fire had been extinguished, adding there were no casualties or increased radiation levels.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Russian authorities said Ukrainian drones had also been shot down over areas sometimes far from the front, including Saint Petersburg in the northwest.
 
 

Ten drones were shot down over the port of Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland, sparking a fire at a fuel terminal owned by Russian energy group Novatek, regional governor Aleksandr Drozdenko wrote on Telegram.
Ukraine’s smaller, outgunned army has relied heavily on drones to respond to Russia’s invasion, notably targeting oil infrastructure to hit a key source of Moscow’s revenues to fund the war.
Russia has seen soaring fuel prices since the attacks began.
Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia had attacked it overnight with a ballistic missile and 72 Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, 48 of which the air force said had been shot down.
A Russian drone strike killed a 47-year-old woman in the eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk, the governor said.
Moscow, Kyiv exchange 146 POWs each
Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine each sent back 146 prisoners of war (POWs) today, Moscow’s defence ministry said, the latest in a series of exchanges that has seen hundreds of POWs released this year.
Large-scale prisoner exchanges were the only tangible result of three rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul between May and July. They remain one of the few areas of cooperation between the two countries since Russia’s offensive began in 2022.
“On August 24, 146 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled” by Kyiv, the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram. “In exchange, 146 prisoners of war of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were transferred” to Ukraine.
Russia also said that “eight citizens of the Russian Federation — residents of the Kursk region, illegally detained” by Kyiv were also returned as part of the exchange.
‘Big power security guarantee and no Nato’
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Sunday that a group of nations, including United Nations Security Council members, should be the guarantors of Ukraine’s security.
Reuters reported last week that President Vladimir Putin is demanding that Ukraine give up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join Nato, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, three sources familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking told Reuters.
Lavrov told NBC News’ ‘Meet the Press’ that Putin and Trump had discussed the issue of a security guarantee for Ukraine and that Putin had raised the issue of the failed Istanbul discussions of 2022.
 


At those discussions, Russia and Ukraine discussed Ukraine’s permanent neutrality in return for security guarantees from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, and other countries, according to a copy of a draft agreement seen by Reuters in 2022.
Lavrov told NBC that a group including Security Council members should guarantee Ukraine’s security.
“The group could also include Germany and Turkey and other countries,” Lavrov said.
“The guarantors would be guaranteeing the security of Ukraine, which must be neutral, which must be non-aligned with any military bloc and which must be non-nuclear,” Lavrov said, according to a transcript of the interview released by the foreign ministry.
Lavrov also made it clear that Nato membership for Ukraine was unacceptable for Russia, that Moscow wanted protection for Russian speakers in Ukraine and that there was a territorial discussion to be had with Ukraine.
‘Ukraine is a fighter’
The latest fighting came as Ukraine marked the anniversary of gaining independence in 1991 in the breakup of the Soviet Union.
“This is how Ukraine strikes when its calls for peace are ignored,” Zelensky said in an Independence Day address.
“Today, both the US and Europe agree: Ukraine has not yet fully won, but it will certainly not lose. Ukraine has secured its independence. Ukraine is not a victim; it is a fighter.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney travelled to Kyiv for the commemorations, calling for “a just and lasting peace for Ukraine”.
Zelensky thanked other world leaders, including Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, King Charles and the pope for sending messages to mark the occasion.
Russia now controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.
The fighting has forced millions of people to flee their homes and destroyed cities and villages across the east and south of Ukraine.
Putin has repeatedly rebuffed calls from Ukraine and the West for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire.
On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said “no meeting” between Putin and Zelensky was planned as Trump’s mediation efforts appeared to stall, while Zelensky accused Russia of trying to prolong the offensive.</p><small>2025-08-24 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24173602dfa56c5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets Bangladesh’s Yunus during historic visit as ‘revitalising Saarc’ comes under focus</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday met Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus during his landmark visit to Dhaka during which the latter stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
The Foreign Office has termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
According to a post on X by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar called on Yunus and apprised him of the developments during his trip. The pair discussed “recent developments in the region and the prospects of regional cooperation”.
“The discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation,” the FO wrote.
 






According to a statement issued by Yunus’s office, the Bangladesh chief adviser during the meeting highlighted the importance of revitalising all potential avenues of regional and bilateral cooperation, urging progress in bilateral trade and emphasising the role of people-to-people connections —particularly among youth.
“I encourage Saarc, and I see our relationship with Pakistan and other Saarc countries as one of the highest priorities,” he said.
 






Later today, Dar called on Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairperson and ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia, according to an FO statement.
The Deputy PM conveyed Pakistan’s well-wishes and lauded Zia’s services as premier, also enquiring about her health. Zia has been in declining health for years, is confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis and also suffers from diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.
“The memories of Begum Zia’s visit to Pakistan in 2006 were also recalled,” the statement read.

Earlier, Pakistan and Bangladesh signed six agreements in various areas of cooperation following delegation-level talks between Dar and Bangladesh Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain.
Both leaders oversaw the signing of “six instruments”, FO Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement.
These included an agreement on visa abolition for diplomatic and official passport holders, as well as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a Joint Working Group on trade.
 
 

Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.
An MoU was also signed between the Foreign Service academies of both countries, while another MoU was inked between the Associated Press of Pakistan and the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha to further media cooperation.
In the domain of academics, an MoU was signed between the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad and Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, while a cultural exchange programme was also agreed upon.
“These agreements will institutionalise and further strengthen the bilateral cooperation in trade and economics, training of diplomats, academic exchanges, media cooperation and cultural exchanges,” the FO statement highlighted.
 






According to Bangladesh’s The Daily Star, Dar and Hossain first held a brief one-to-one discussion before leading their respective delegations in a formal meeting at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka.
During their wide-ranging talks, both sides reviewed the “entire gamut of bilateral relations”, the FO said on X.
“The talks took place in a constructive atmosphere, reflecting the existing goodwill and cordiality between [the] two countries. Both sides agreed to work for further strengthening of bilateral relations,” the FO noted. Hossain also hosted a lunch in Dar’s honour.
Matters discussed included “high-level exchanges, trade and economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts, cultural exchanges, cooperation on education and capacity building, and humanitarian issues”.
Regional and international issues, including rejuvenation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) and resolution of Palestine and the Rohingya issues, were also discussed.
Separately, Pakistan launched “Pakistan-Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor”, a project which envisages the grant of 500 scholarships to Bangladeshi students for pursuing higher studies in Pakistan during the next five years.
“A quarter of these scholarships will be awarded in the field of medicine. Additionally, training for 100 Bangladeshi civil servants will be arranged during the same period,” the FO said in a statement.
Pakistan will also increase the scholarships allocated to Bangladeshi students under the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme from five to 25.
 






Continuing his series of meetings with Bangladeshi politicians, Dar met Jamaat-i-Islami emir Dr Shafiqur Rahman at his residence.
The deputy premier, on his and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s behalf, conveyed his best wishes for good health to Rahman, who is recovering after a cardiac surgery.
Dar also appreciated Rahman’s “life-long positive contribution in the fields of politics, education and social welfare”, the FO said.
 






Meeting with commerce adviser, trade officials
In the morning, Dar and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan had a breakfast meeting with Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, who was accompanied by various finance and trade officials, the FO said on X.
“The two sides discussed ways to promote economic and commercial cooperation, with a special focus on enhancing trade and promoting connectivity,” the post said.
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Ahsan H. Mansur, National Board of Revenue Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan and Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission Chairman Moinul Khan joined the meeting as well.
Other officials attending the gathering were textile ministry secretary Md Abdur Rauf, tourism ministry secretary Nasreen Jahan, Ministry of Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh Chairman Brigadier Gen Mohammad Faisal Azad and High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan, according to the FO.
 






Last night, Dar and Kamal attended a reception hosted by Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider.
In his remarks at the reception, the foreign minister underscored that the people of Pakistan had fraternal sentiments towards the people of Bangladesh, the FO said on X.
“He noted that the relations between the two countries were anchored in centuries-old shared traditions, Islamic heritage, social norms and literary expressions.”
 






Wishing the people of Bangladesh a harmonious and prosperous future, Dar expressed Pakistan’s “strong desire to forge a cooperative and forward-looking relationship with Bangladesh”.
The deputy PM interacted with personalities from “different walks of life, including advisers of the Bangladeshi government, bureaucrats, leadership of political parties, vice chancellors, members of intelligentsia and think tanks, sportsmen, artists, journalists, retired generals, and others”, the FO added.
Beginning his two-day visit yesterday, Dar met with the delegations of Bangladesh’s three political parties — National Citizens Party (NCP), Jamaat-i-Islami and the BNP.
The Daily Star, quoting unnamed foreign ministry officials, said the two sides are also planning to hold the long-stalled Joint Economic Commission meeting in September or October, two decades since its last session. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb may visit Dhaka for the meeting, the report added.

Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued an advisory, forecasting widespread rains in the province from August 22 to 26.
DI Khan Rescue 1122 spokesperson, in a statement, said that “torrential rains claimed the lives of eight people in DI Khan last night,” while 48 people were injured in roof collapse incidents across the city, as per a PDMA report.
According to the Rescue 1122 statement, “heavy rains and strong winds caused widespread infrastructure damage as multiple incidents of damage to trees, walls, and solar panels were reported.”
Rescue 1122 teams were “actively engaged in rescue operations in the affected areas”, said the statement, as all the injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals.
Rescue teams were working to clear out debris from the damage caused by the heavy deluge, the statement added.
Detailing rescue efforts, the District Emergency Officer Engineer Fasihullah said, “Our top priority is the protection of citizens, and we are utilising every available resource in the rescue operation”.
KP death toll since August 15 rises to 406
According to the latest data issued by KP PDMA, last night’s rains in DI Khan have taken the province’s rain-related death toll since August 15 to 406, which includes 305 men, 55 women and 46 children.
District Buner’s death toll has risen to 237, while Swabi has recorded 42 deaths due to flash floods till now, according to PDMA. Mansehra reported 25 deaths in flash floods, landslides and roof collapse incidents. Another three people lost their lives in Battagram due to flash floods.
Abbottabad and Noshwera reported two deaths each, the PDMA report said.
Mardan, Upper Kohistan, Torghar, and South Waziristan recorded one death each.
The PDMA report said that 247 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, out of which 175 are men, 38 women, and 30 children. The highest number of injuries was reported in Buner at 128.
Since August 15, a total of 3,526 houses have been damaged due to rain and flash floods, including 577 that were destroyed completely.
The number of cattle that perished during the rain was 5,727, according to the report.
 
 

PDMA spokesperson has advised the public to contact the authority’s helpline at 1700 in case of any emergency or weather updates.
PDMA’s emergency operation centre remains fully functional, the spokesperson added.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking to Dawn.com on Saturday, assailed the federal government for its “inadequate support” to KP, particularly Buner.
“Centre only provided six things to Buner: 200 tents, 98 ration packages,  five generators, five dewatering pumps, 400 blankets and 500 kgs of medicine”, he claimed, saying that, “This is nothing”.
Gohar also appealed to the Centre to provide the people of KP relief from electricity bills at this “difficult time”.
In a related development, Bahrain’s Interior Minister, Lieutenant General Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, held a telephonic conversation with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi today to convey his sorrow over the loss of lives caused by rains and floods in Pakistan.
 






On Friday, the Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a red alert, urging provincial and district administrations to brace for pot­­ential flooding as a fresh monsoon spell has been forecasted to lash the country from Aug 23 to 29.
According to NDMA data, at least 788 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-24 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/241924554275f9f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936884/gb-lake-formed-by-glacial-outburst-poses-no-danger-govt' target='_blank'><strong>GB lake formed by glacial outburst ‘poses no danger’: govt</strong></a><br><p>A lake formed by the recent glacial outburst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Ghizer district has reduced to 40 feet and poses no danger to nearby settlements, the regional government spokesperson said on Sunday.
A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) refers to a rush of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. A Glof occurred on early Friday morning in the Talidas village of Gupis Valley, with at least 200 people being evacuated safely thanks to a shepherd’s warning.
“For now, there is no danger from the lake,” said a statement by GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq. The lake had earlier threatened the downstream areas of Ghizer, Gilgit and Diamer.
As the Glof wreaked havoc downstream, 330 households comprising over 3,000 individuals had become internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the incident, according to Israruddin Israr, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan’s GB coordinator.
 
 

The number of IDPs in this incident is the second-largest since the 2010 Attabad disaster, Israr noted. The residents of Talidas had been shifted to a tent settlement, Faraq said yesterday, acknowledging that the early warning system was not active in Ghizer.
Relief operations were underway for the affected residents, with GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza supervising the efforts on the site, Faraq said today.
The spokesperson further said that three shepherds who “saved 300 human lives” through their prompt alerts have been invited by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat.
“We have been told by the PM Secretariat to send the three shepherds to Islamabad. It seems that [Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif] will meet the shepherds and encourage them,” Faraq added.
One of them was Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier and used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood.

“It is also necessary to encourage Nasir, who saved about half a dozen human lives in Ghizer’s Daen [village]. Ali Ahmed, who saved the lives of about 50 volunteers in Gojal Valley’s Gulmit town, is also indispensable,” Faraq said.
Faraq told Dawn.com that the shepherds had to depart for Islamabad via flight today, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Subsequently, they were set to travel to the federal capital by road.
GB CM Haji Gulbar Khan has also announced a cash reward for the shepherd who warned about the flood.
Locals complained that hundreds who had been rendered homeless after the Glof incident in Talidas were facing difficulties in accessing basic necessities.
In a statement, GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain said standard operating procedures had been prepared for releasing water from the artificial lake while keeping the local population and infrastructure safe.
The “comprehensive” SOPs were prepared by a technical team that visited the site on August 23 in view of the potential hazards posed by the lake.
According to the administration, work on an alternative route for the temporary restoration of Gilgit-Shandur Road in the area was underway and traffic was expected to resume in the next 48 hours.
While the National Highway Authority (NHA) has mobilised heavy machinery for the route’s permanent restoration, it is subject to the stabilisation of the mud in the area, which is being continuously monitored.
 


Former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman, in a statement, has expressed reservations about the Glof-II project for early warning systems, installed by the United Nations Development Programme across GB for Rs10 billion.
He alleged these funds were misused and demanded an investigation into the system’s failure.
 
 

“This project was under the federal climate change ministry, and we had suggested involving the local community. However, these funds were misused,” Rehman claimed.
Noting that the installation of early warning systems in areas without electricity and other facilities was not feasible, the former CM suggested providing satellite phones to the locals. “It is a sustainable, low-cost, manual system that is more effective than the installation of billion-rupee equipment, he contended.
Another Glof alert amid fresh rain spell
Meanwhile, a fresh rain spell started in scattered areas across GB today, creating fear of more disasters among vulnerable communities of further Glofs.
According to the district administration, Astore Valley Road has been blocked after landslides. People in affected areas faced difficulties as roads, water channels, and irrigation channels remained disconnected at multiple locations.
The K2 road in Shigar, important roads in Ghanche, Chipursan Valley and Misgar Road in Hunza, and other flood-affected roads in Ghizer remained disconnected.
 
 

Affected people in flood-hit areas also faced issues with the drinking water supply systems, while agriculture and crops were badly affected due to the unavailability of irrigation water.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an alert about an increased risk of Glof, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It noted that a wet spell is likely to prevail from August 23 and can affect GB and KP. Scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, are expected in the two regions during this period.
The PMD advised the public to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation.
The Gilgit-Shandur road and other link roads in Ghizer remained blocked, with people also facing challenges in accessing other areas.
With increasing Glof and cloudburst events in GB, people became more conscious, and fear prevails among residents.
Zulfiqar Ali, a Gilgit resident, is scared of even light rain. He said people have become uncertain as GB has never experienced such disasters before.

Rayan clocked 30.87 in the Men’s 50m Breaststroke to smash the previous record of 30.98 set by Abdul Aziz Chaudhry 17 years ago. To put it into perspective, the record was set before Rayan was even born. He finished 58th out of 86 swimmers in the breaststroke sprint.
Azlan can safely call himself the junior medley king after smashing the Under-16 national records in both the 200m and 400m Individual Medley.
He swam a 2:14.18 in the 200m IM to obliterate the previous record of 2:20.22 set by Ahmed Durrani, who represented Pakistan at the Paris 2024 Olympics last year. Azlan finished 47th out of 73 swimmers in the heats.
Azlan then went 4:54.68 in the 400m IM to smash the age group record of 4:57.86 set by Amaan Siddiqui in 2022.
 

Azlan Sohail swam a 4:54.68 in the 400m IM to smash the age group record of 4:57.86 set by Amaan Siddiqui in 2022.

The 16-year-old had a mammoth lineup of 10 events ranging from sprints to mid-distance, but he delivered in every single race. He clocked 26.72 in the 50m Butterfly to finish 80th out of 116 swimmers.
Compatriot Ali Mitha finished 61st in the same event with a time of 25.95. The duo battled it out in the 100m Freestyle as well, with Azlan clocking a 54.73 to finish 93rd ahead of Ali at 104th with a 55.55.
The duo, alongside Hareem Malik and Meher Maqbool, set a new national  record of 04:10.45 in the Mixed 4x100m Freestyle Relay, according to official data released by World Aquatics.

Lone swam a 2:24.33 in the 200m Backstroke and 2:20.78 in the 200m IM. He capped off the last of his mid-distance swims with a 2:41.02	in the 200m Breaststroke just ahead of Rayan, who clocked in 2:41.71.
Aside from breaking a nearly two-decade old record, British-based Rayan swam a 1:10.06 in the 100m Breaststroke.
Over on the women’s side, Hareem Malik has been dominating breaststroke and swam a 36.12 in the 50m event, where she holds a national record set at last year’s junior national championships.
She swam a 33.70 in the 50m Butterfly to finish 99th, while Fatima Salman,  the team’s youngest swimmer at just 14 years of age, clocked 35.52. They went head to head in the 50m Freestyle too and it was once again Hareem who came out on top with a 30.71 while Fatima finished with a 32.68.
Fatima went 1:19.93 in the 100m Butterfly and a 2:55.91 in the 200m IM.
Meher Maqbool clocked 1:10.03 and 2:28.44 in the 100m and 200m Freestyle respectively. She swam a 35.69 in the 50m Backstroke and finished just behind Raaqiah Aqeel with a 35.30. Meher then went 1:17.49 in the 100m — where she claimed the title at last year’s nationals — while Raaqiah swam a 2:53.37 in the 20m Backstroke.
The women’s quartet set two new records when they swam a 4:48.46 in the 4x100m Freestyle Relay to break the previous record of 4:49.55, and a 5:12.55 in the 4x100m Medley Relay to smash the previous mark of 5:36.37.

According to a first information report (FIR) available with Dawn.com, the complainant said he is a government employee and performing his duties on August 22 while supervising the laying of fibre optic cable near a petrol pump on Sharea Faisal.
“At around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons travelling in three vehicles arrived there, in which the suspects and others were travelling,” the FIR stated.
“They stopped their cars near him (the complainant) and called him over, saying that “sahib (Farhan Ghani) was asking ’With whose permission are you digging the land?’”
The complainant replied by saying that he is a government employee, and this work is being carried out with a no-objection certificate from government institutions, the FIR stated.
 


“Some of them (suspects) misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately,” the FIR read. “When the complainant said this work was being done with the permission of all institutions, they started using abusive language and beating him.”
The FIR alleged that the suspects were asking “why he was not stopping the work on the directions of ‘the sahib’”. It further alleged that four or five armed suspects aimed pistols at the complainant.
“Subsequently, they dragged the complainant to a room of the petrol pump where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him,” the FIR read.
Police eventually arrived at the scene and rescued the complainant, taking him to Ferozeabad police station, where he lodged the FIR against the suspects, including Farhan.
The FIR was registered at Ferozabad police station against Farhan and four other suspects under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common
object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 337A(i)(punishment for assault), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (punishment for theft) and 506B (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the PPC, read with Section 7 (punishment for terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Saeed Ghani took to X to address the situation, stating that Farhan and his “associates” had a “dispute” with someone who filed an FIR, as per their “legal right”.
“Farhan Ghani, along with all the individuals, will surrender themselves to the authorities and face the law, proving their innocence in court,” he wrote.
 






In a video statement uploaded to X later today, Saeed outlined that the FIR was registered against his brother and the other suspects and noted that Farhan turned himself in willingly, since the act was “unlawful and warranted an FIR”.
“This is an arrest and purely a legal issue. God willing, we will resolve it by legal means,” Ghani said, expressing gratitude to party supporters and colleagues for their messages of support.
“This is not an issue for the party workers to take to heart,” he added. “We will resolve this matter soon through legal means.”

The hosts were playing for pride, down 2-0 in the series, and responded magnificently, posting an ominous 431-2 after opting to bat — their highest ODI total on home soil.
They then dismissed the Proteas for 155 in the 25th over, with spinner Cooper Connolly taking 5-22.
Head was supreme in blazing 142 off 103 balls, ably supported by skipper Marsh (100 from 106).
Their 250-run platform at Great Barrier Reef Arena was Australia’s highest ever opening partnership against the Proteas, bettering the 170 by Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist in Durban in 2002.
Green then took over with a whirlwind 118 not out to mark the first time Australia’s top three have all scored centuries. Alex Carey was unbeaten on 50, with the 18 sixes slogged between them also a record  at home.
“A pretty crazy day, a full performance by the lads,” said Marsh.
“But full credit to South Africa, they played outstandingly well in the first two games and were too good for us.”
South Africa did themselves no favours by resting quicks Nandre Burger and Lungi Ngidi, with their second-string attack outplayed.
After Marsh won the toss, the openers made an aggressive start, driving Australia to 86 after the 10-over powerplay.
Head was in ominous touch, crunching boundaries with ease to reach his half-century off 32 deliveries.
At the other end, Marsh slammed two big sixes as he also got in the groove, going after the Proteas’ fresh new-ball pairing of Kwena Maphaka and Wiaan Mulder.
Batted beautifully
With the bowlers running out of ideas, Head cruised to a seventh ODI century, pushing Senuran Muthusamy for an easy single.
He then really let rip with a series of big hits before being caught in the deep by Dewald Brevis off Keshav Maharaj after crunching 17 fours and five sixes.
Marsh battled to three figures soon after but was out next ball, taken on the run by wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton after he skied Muthusamy.
But the onslaught was far from over with Green producing a sizzling display of power-hitting, including three giant sixes in a row off Muthusamy to post his maiden ODI century.
Only Glenn Maxwell (40 balls) has scored a faster hundred for Australia.
“The two openers, they batted beautifully so me and ‘Kez’ (Carey) could just bat with a lot of freedom,” said Green.
South Africa’s chase started badly with four wickets down for 50 inside nine overs.
Sean Abbott accounted for Aiden Markram (two) and skipper Temba Bavuma (19) while Xavier Bartlett took care of Rickelton (11) and Tristan Stubbs (one).
The visitors’ big hope was Brevis and he produced some fireworks in his 49 before Green caught him on the ropes off Connolly, who then cleaned up the tail.
“We were under the pump from the first ball and didn’t really pitch up today,” said Bavuma. “They put us under pressure and we didn’t have the answers.”</p><small>2025-08-24 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/241624248d97280.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936898/social-stigma-poses-life-threatening-risks-for-transgender-people-living-with-hivaids' target='_blank'><strong>Social stigma poses life-threatening risks for transgender people living with HIV/AIDS</strong></a><br><p>A*, a 22-year-old transgender woman, celebrated for her mesmerising performances at wedding parties, saw her life take a devastating turn when she was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.
The news of the deadly, yet treatable disease was like a bomb shell for her, but instead of seeking timely treatment, she kept her diagnosis hidden from her peers due to fear of losing her livelihood and being evicted from the shared room she called home after leaving her family in Rawalpindi.
“A’s health began to decline with weakness and anaemia clearly visible in her body. Yet, she dismissed it each time and blamed relentless fever as the sole cause of her suffering,” recalls her colleague, W*.
“Dancing at weddings and social gatherings while battling illness became exhausting for A and her health deteriorated rapidly due to avoiding medical treatment, leaving her bedridden within months,” shares S*, a roommate of A, who served as her chaperone during visits to marriage gatherings.
S said he took A to Peshawar’s Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) for treatment, where he learned about her HIV infection.

“We immediately took her to the AIDS treatment centre at LRH and were informed by doctors that she is already registered with them, but the delay in getting medicine has caused severe complications,“ he said. “A’s final days were very heartbreaking as she wept in pain and due to the absence of her parents and siblings in this difficult phase of life.”
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa transgender community president and executive director of the Manzil Foundation, Arzoo Khan, says: “The practice of concealing illness, particularly HIV/AIDS, is prevalent among the transgender community due to societal stigma, psychological trauma, fear of rejection from community and discrimination within the healthcare setting, where they are often denied emergency treatment, refused routine medical care and subjected to harassment and abuse.”
Arzoo adds that many transgender people are living with HIV/AIDS, but due to social stigma, they are avoiding treatment from medical care centres, putting their own health at serious risk.
She said that recently, a transgender person from Malakand district arrived in Peshawar in a serious condition and was taken to the HIV/AIDS treatment centre at LRH.

“P, the transgender from Malakand district, delayed her medical treatment for nearly two years and now her health has severely deteriorated, leaving her in critical condition,” Arzoo adds.
According to the Provincial AIDS Control Programme, a concerning increase has been witnessed in HIV/AIDS infection cases in the province.
 
 

The number of HIV patients in KP until June 2025 reached 8,398, of which 6,448 are men, 2,119 women, 197 transgender and 445 children. In the first six months of 2025, around 741 new HIV patients were registered in KP.
There are a total of 13 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in KP, with the highest number of registered HIV positive patients in Peshawar.
“A could have challenged the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDs by seeking proper medical advice and starting treatment immediately after her diagnosis, saving her own life and setting an example for others,” regrets Farzana, the president of the TransAction KP.
 
 

“The fear of losing her livelihood and being evicted from the community claimed her own life at the peak of her youth, leaving the community in a state of deep dejection and grief.“
Nayyer Mujeeb, an HIV patient and president of the KP chapter of the Association of People Living with HIV Pakistan (APLHIV), says: “In addition to transgender individuals, who already belong to a marginalised community, men and women living with HIV/AIDS also face severe stigma, which often discourages them from visiting treatment centres to collect their routine medicines.“
Nayyer tells APP that she is in contact with several HIV patients who are hesitant to seek treatment publicly, and to ensure continuity of medical care, she delivers medications directly to them at their homes.

A research report jointly compiled by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights reads: “Transgender individuals living with HIV face a dual crisis: the virus itself and the devastating impact of societal stigma.“
The report, titled Understanding the Impact of HIV stigma on Transgender Persons Living with HIV in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — the first ever in KP — aims to comprehensively examine the impact of HIV stigma on transgender persons and its broader implications on healthcare access, social inclusion, and legal protections.
The study finds that many transgender individuals experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and even violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.
Structural inequalities such as economic marginalisation, lack of legal protection and social exclusion push many transgender individuals into high-risk behaviours, including sex work and unsafe injection practices, which increase their vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, the study mentions.
“Exclusion of transgender persons from national healthcare programmes, combined with legal ambiguities and widespread discrimination, has resulted in severe health disparities, particularly in the context of HIV prevention, treatment, and care,” observes Shawana Shah, programme director of Da Hawwa Lur (Daughter of Eve).
Shawana says that Da Hawwa Lur recently conducted a research study to document and understand the experiences, needs and challenges of transgender individuals at the grassroots level.
The study suggests an inclusive, gender-affirming healthcare policy to reduce HIV/AIDS risks among the transgender community through their equitable participation in treatment programmes.

Police officers told Dawn that retired Capt Syed Zeeshan Haider, a grade 18 police officer, had put the president and his motorcade at a grave security risk.
The officers said that on Thursday evening, President Zardari was scheduled to visit a family in Bahria Town.
He, accompanied by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and others, moved to Bahria Town from the Presidency. The VVIP motorcade strayed on the Expressway after crossing Koral Chowk, even though security measures and VVIP route were put in place. Instead of taking a turn towards Bahria Town, the motorcade moved further beyond the security cordon and the VVIP route.
As a result, the VVIP motorcade was stuck in traffic for over half an hour, they added.
The interior minister and the related security agencies showed serious concern over the poor supervision and management regarding the VVIP route and security.
In response, Mr Haider was removed from both offices and sent to the Central Police Office Islamabad till further orders.
Retired Sqn-Ldr Abdul Haque, a grade-19 officer, was given the additional charge of the SSP security, while Pari Gul Tareen, a grade-18 officer, was given the additional charge of SSP traffic police.

Loudspeaker towers are commonplace on Indonesia’s main island of Java, blaring a repetitive mix of electronic tunes and traditional folk music at street parties, but they have drawn the ire of local authorities and calm-seeking neighbours.
The loudspeaker stacks have proven so disruptive that officials this month have restricted their use while religious bodies have declared excessive and damaging sound from them to be “haram”, or forbidden under Islamic law.
“The sound is booming from 1pm to 3am. They play loud music and drink alcohol,” Ahmad Suliyat, a resident of Ngantru village in East Java province, told AFP.
“It’s really disturbing.” Indonesians in East Java have shared videos on social media of cracked walls, falling roof tiles and damaged stores caused by the noise impact known as “sound horeg”, which loosely means to move or vibrate in Javanese.

The online backlash forced authorities in East Java to issue an order this month limiting noise levels and specifying the times and locations loudspeakers can be used.
“It was made for health and security reasons. The noise level must be regulated so it will not disturb the public peace and order,” East Java governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa told AFP.
Hearing problems
Ear-splitting noise has been shown to have adverse health consequences, including a higher risk of heart conditions for those exposed.
And Indonesia’s loudspeaker towers, popular for little more than a decade in the world’s most populous Muslim nation, have had dire consequences for some who attend the deafening street gatherings.

A woman died this month after allegedly suffering cardiac arrest caused by loudspeaker towers at a carnival she attended, local media reported, while there has been an increase in hearing problems among those attending the events.
The East Java government has capped sound system levels at 120 decibels, while mobile units used in parades or protests are limited to 85 decibels.
Mobile units are also banned from being used near schools, hospitals, ambulances and places of worship that are in session.
In July, a local Islamic council issued a religious edict that said excessive sound at parties that is capable of causing damage is forbidden by religion.
“The use of a sound system excessively, especially during a wedding convoy, or any other events that cause noise, disturb road users, or make people neglect worshipping, is haram,” read the fatwa.
Locals typically rent the speaker towers for weddings, circumcisions and Independence Day events – all celebrations that can last until dawn.
Some, like Daini, who goes by one name like many Indonesians, believe the loudspeakers are a local tradition that should be kept.
She glanced at her cracked window, held together by duct tape, as music blared from the truck in Ngantru.
“The glass cracked during a sound horeg event last year. But that’s OK, people here like loud events,” said the 61-year-old.
Lax enforcement
But loudspeakers have continued blasting above the new limits, due to lax enforcement by local authorities.
After the rules were issued, an AFP journalist heard loudspeaker towers blaring music at an East Javan event as authorities watched on.
The World Health Organisation says sound at 85 decibels and above can cause hearing damage over time, and anything above 120 decibels can cause immediate harm.

Some Indonesians posted screenshots online of apps registering loudspeaker sound levels as high as 130 decibels.
Operators of loudspeaker towers argue they are responding to demand that generates revenue for local businesses.
“I believe most people who dislike sound horeg are not from here,” David Stevan Laksamana, a 40-year-old loudspeaker rental owner in Malang, told AFP.
“In Malang alone, it employed tens of thousands of people. This business is helping the economy.” Others who cannot stand the disruptive street parties fear reporting them, with some loudspeaker tower owners reportedly parking outside complainants’ houses to blare music for hours.
“I never complain to the village head,” said Ahmad.
“I just keep quiet. I’m afraid of intimidation if I say anything. “</p><small>2025-08-24 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/241242288838042.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936878/indian-batsman-cheteshwar-pujara-calls-time-on-illustrious-career' target='_blank'><strong>Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara calls time on illustrious career</strong></a><br><p>Veteran batsman Cheteshwar Pujara dropped curtains on his illustrious India career on Sunday after playing 103 Tests but failing to win back his place in the last two years.
The 37-year-old, who made his Test debut in 2010, last played for India in the 2023 World Test Championship final but has been active in domestic cricket as well as county cricket in England.
“Wearing the Indian jersey, singing the anthem, and trying my best each time I stepped on the field — it’s impossible to put into words what it truly meant,” Pujara wrote on his social media pages.
 






“But as they say, all good things must come to an end, and with immense gratitude I have decided to retire from all forms of Indian cricket. Thank you for all the love and support!”
The cricketer’s message continued: “As a little boy from the small town of Rajkot, along with my parents, I set out to aim for the stars; and dreamt to be a part of the Indian cricket team.
“Little did I know then that this game would give me so much — invaluable opportunities, experiences, purpose, love, and above all a chance to represent my state and this great nation.”
Pujara joins former India captains Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and spinner Ravichandran Ashwin from the same generation to quit Test cricket within the past year.
He scored 7,195 runs, including 19 hundreds, from 103 Tests, averaging 43.60.
Pujara also played five one-day internationals but his solid defence and a remarkable ability to play marathon knocks made him an asset in Test cricket.
 
 

He demonstrated those skills most notably in 2018-19 when India registered their maiden Test series victory in Australia with player-of-the-series Pujara amassing 521 runs in seven innings.
Pujara batted a combined 11 hours in the opening Test in Adelaide, scoring 123 and 71 as India won the series opener.
Former India captain Anil Kumble led tributes to Pujara.
“Congratulations on a fantastic career! You have been a great ambassador of this wonderful game,” Kumble, who also coached an Indian side featuring Pujara, wrote on X.
“We are all proud of all your achievements on the cricket field. You gave it your all for the team! It was a privilege to have worked with you and may you continue to shine in your second innings.”
 






Pujara, a rare five-day specialist in the age of T20 and white-ball performers, has in the past attributed his staying power to discipline.
“I have certain routines, fitness, a little bit of meditation, yoga and pranayama (a breathing technique) because it is necessary to shut the outside noise, even if it is positive,” he told reporters in 2023.
“We play nine Tests on an average, and when you go back home, unless you have domestic cricket, you are not in touch with the game. Keep challenging yourself, keep training, looking forward.”</p><small>2025-08-24 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2410435148c77be.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936325/murree-tops-rawalpindi-in-dengue-cases-as-attock-records-five-infections' target='_blank'><strong>Murree tops Rawalpindi in dengue cases as Attock records five infections</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: For the first time since 2011, the number of dengue patients in Murree has surpassed Rawalpindi, as confirmed cases in the hilly district rose to 62.
Meanwhile, 59 dengue patients have been reported in Rawalpindi district so far this year.
This year, dengue cases in Murree have been reported from Ghel and Paghwari union councils and the numbers are still rising.
In the Rawalpindi division, 62 cases have been confirmed in Murree, 59 in Rawalpindi, one in Jhelum, four in Chakwal and five in Attock.

Majority of the cases in Murree have been reported from Ghel and Paghwari union councils

A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that dengue surveillance in Murree had not been conducted earlier due to a shortage of staff. Surveillance began only after the virus started spreading. He said the Rawalpindi District Health Authority was managing health affairs in Murree despite it being declared a separate district.
 
 

He added that once dengue cases were detected, the Murree district administration launched a drive to control the virus. Around 300 workers were deployed in Murree after the virus spread in two main union councils.
Deputy Commissioner Murree Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that the district administration had launched an anti-dengue campaign to prevent further spread of the virus and protect residents.
He said teams had been deployed to carry out fogging and that 441 workers from different departments were trained and assigned for fogging and surveillance.
“We obtained necessary supplies from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, including 1,300 nets, 10,000 bottles of anti-mosquito lotion, IRS machines and other items,” he added.
“Section 144 has been imposed along streams and junkyards, and due to this, the number of patients is declining with each passing day. We expect the flow of patients to end by mid-September or October as temperatures fall further,” he said.
On the other hand, Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said an anti-dengue campaign had been launched, supervised by parliamentarians and assistant commissioners.
He said rainfall had created problems for the campaign, but stressed that the work must be completed to protect people from the virus. He added that the provincial government had provided all necessary resources, and it was the duty of officials to carry out their responsibilities.
He said monitoring of all graveyards and junkyards had started, and parliamentarians would inspect and report shortcomings in the campaign. Strict action, he added, would be taken against negligence.
Meanwhile, the Attock district has reported a total of five confirmed dengue cases to date.
The cases are spread across several tehsils, with Hassanabdal registering one (UC Burhan), Fatehjang one (urban area), Pindigheb two, including one imported (UC Ikhlas and UC Kamrial) and Attock city one (urban area).
Despite the confirmed cases, authorities emphasised that all infections were sporadic, with no clusters detected, and that swift case-response protocols had been activated.
Alongside immediate patient care, extensive anti-dengue operations—including surveillance and larva control—are underway across the district to prevent further spread.
When contacted, Chief Executive District Health Authority Dr Asad Ismail said all confirmed patients had been treated according to standard operating procedures and that comprehensive vector control operations had been launched.
“Our teams are visiting high-risk areas daily. Larvicidal activities and awareness campaigns are ongoing, and public cooperation is essential to keep the situation under control,” he added.
Responding to a question, he said that in line with provincial strategies, Attock’s health authorities were employing intensive surveillance, rapid response teams, larval elimination drives, public awareness campaigns, and inter-departmental coordination to curb the disease.
He said the district health office was liaising with education and local bodies to ensure clean water storage, schoolyard inspections, and vector-free environments, especially ahead of the monsoon period.
Meanwhile, residents in Pindigheb and Attock city expressed concern over stagnant water in open plots and under-construction areas. “We appreciate the government’s efforts, but stricter action is needed to remove breeding sites permanently,” said Muhammad Riaz, a shopkeeper in UC Kamrial.
While dengue activity in Attock remains relatively contained this year, Punjab in previous years has experienced far more severe outbreaks.

Speaking on his upcoming clash, Rizwan framed it as a classic striker versus grappler match-up.
He acknowledged the contrasting styles each man brings to the cage. While Adham boasts a record of 11 wins and four losses and carries a reputation for his grappling strength, Rizwan believes his own striking prowess will be the difference-maker.
“We both have contrasting styles as my opponent struggles in striking while I lack a bit in my wrestling; so it will be a good fight,” he said, anticipating a compelling battle for the fans.
But for the 26-year-old phenom known as “The Haider,” this fight is more than just another notch on his perfect 9-0 record; it is another step towards a much bigger journey.
Hailing from the small city of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi District, Rizwan’s ambition burns far brighter than mere local acclaim. He has set his sights on a goal no Pakistan fighter has ever achieved: to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
“There is no Pakistani in the UFC, world’s most famous league, and I want to be the first and [I am] working for it as hard as I can,” Rizwan emphasised.
Yet, he is acutely aware of the systemic challenges that have held Pakistan fighters back. He noted that the reason no one has reached the UFC yet is a matter of development, not desire.
“We don’t have the skills to compete there,” he explained candidly. “MMA as a sport is still in its early stages in Pakistan, so we don’t have coaches who can train us to reach that level.”
This stark reality fuels his urgency for support. Rizwan emphasised that for Pakistan athletes to compete on the world stage, they need significant investment.
“We need big sponsors so that we can afford to train with better foreign coaches,” he said, adding with sobering honesty, “otherwise there’s no chance.”
His recent triumphs have carried an extra layer of motivation, particularly his stunning streak of knocking out three Indian opponents in his last three fights. For Rizwan, these victories were personal, fuelled by a familiar national narrative he was determined to rewrite.
“I had an extra motivation as we most of the time lose to India in cricket so I just badly wanted to win no matter what it took,” he expressed.
Beyond the gloves, the wraps, and the fierce rivalries, Rizwan also shed light on the less glamorous, but critical, aspect of a fighter’s life: discipline. He spoke on the immense importance of diet, both during fight week and in his daily routine.
“You have to focus on every nutritional aspect to stay fit,” Rizwan said. “You need to have a strict diet and eat clean and healthy as when you’re not fighting you gain weight pretty quickly and cutting it during the fight week could become very difficult.”
As Sunday approaches, Rizwan stands ready – a symbol of Pakistan’s raw, untapped potential in MMA.
He carries the hopes of a nation yet to be represented on the sport’s grandest stage and the quiet confidence of a man who believes his hand will be raised, his mission advanced and his knockout prediction fulfilled.

“We are really worried that the drivers are being held responsible for the derailments and accidents despite the fact the such untoward events are happening because of the brakeless wagons and coaches. Though, after recent instructions, the situation has improved in the passenger train operations with shortened train composition by excluding faulty coaches, the use of brakeless wagons in goods’ trains is still continued,” explained PR Train Drivers Association (Multan chapter) President Karim Bakhsh while talking to Dawn on Saturday.
“They (the officers) know very well that derailments are caused due to the rolling stock. Then why are they holding our drivers responsible for this,” he wondered.
In a recent communication after accidents of 116-Down and 14-Down, the PR administration directed to use coaches and wagons having adequate and tested braking power in all passenger and goods trains.
The administration, on the orders of the Railways minister, also directed to use only that rolling stock cleared by the mechanical department with certified braking efficiency. It also directed the officers concerned to ensure checking brake power of all coaches and wagons in the trains before departure.
 
 

Mr Bakhsh said the association office bearers met the officers concerned on Saturday and told them about the ongoing operation of goods trains having only 40-50 percent brakeless and faulty wagons despite clear directions by the minister. “During the meeting, we gave our officers a week to resolve this issue. We will otherwise have no option but to stop the operation of goods trains,” he warned.
Meanwhile, a meeting of train drivers was also held wherein the participants expressed grave concerns over the behaviour of the railways’ authorities.
They were of the view that since the trains were still being run with dummy wagons (a term used for faulty or brakeless wagons or coaches), holding drivers responsible on the pretext of overshooting was highly condemnable. They also pointed out faulty safety devices and sensors installed in the locomotives.
“When the safety devices, coaches, wagons etc don’t work properly, what can you expect from the driver,” questioned Train Drivers Association (Lahore Chapter) President Irfan Iqbal. He said the association would see what the officers concerned do in the coming days. “If they fail to comply with the instructions fully, we will call a meeting for adopting further course of action,” he warned.
LESCO: In an operation at Awan town bazaar, the Lesco teams detected massive power theft and got 10 people arrested for stealing electricity.
The team, according to a spokesperson, also removed 18 meters and 100 meter cable besides submitting application to police for registration of case against power thieves.

• GB survivors face shortage of essentials; over 3,000 displaced in Ghizer; Glof-II project probe demanded
LAHORE: A day before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell, the Punjab government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
The Provincial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA) initiated evacuations and emergency operations across multiple districts amid a new and intense monsoon spell forecast on August 24-27. According to a hydrological report by the Board of Revenue, the situation at Ganda Singh Wala was critical and expected to persist for the next 48 hours.
 
 

In response, district administrations in central and southern Punjab were racing against time to relocate communities living along the riverbanks. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that over 19,000 people were evacuated from multiple flood-affected areas of the province.
He said a high alert had been issued for the districts of Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, and Vehari. He said that the evacuation and transportation of 19,947 people from areas adjacent to the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum rivers had been completed.
“The evacuation of populations settled in the riverbeds of the Sutlej and Ravi is our utmost priority. All resources are being employed for the protection of citizens,” stated Khawaja Salman Rafique, provincial minister and chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Disaster Management, following an emergency meeting at the PDMA headquarters.
 


‘Mixed picture’
The river situation across Punjab showed a mixed picture as the Indus River at Tarbela and Kalabagh was rising. The Chenab and Ravi river systems were stable and within normal bounds at all major gauges. The hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan, though normal at the time, were also being closely monitored.
The epicentre of the crisis remains Sutlej, where authorities were focusing evacuation efforts in areas like Jalalpur Pirwala. “We have begun relocating residents to prevent any potential damage. Their lives and property are our primary concern,” said Multan’s Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu.
The urgency of these operations is compounded by a fresh weather warning. The Paki­stan Meteorological Depart­ment has forecast an “eighth spell” of monsoon rains from August 24 to 27, expected to bring torrential rains to the upper regions of Punjab and other parts of the country.
Punjab Relief Commis­sioner Nabil Javaid said rescue teams had been pre-deployed to sensitive locations and that relief camps were fully operational. “These camps are equipped with all basic facilities, including medicines and vaccines. We are ensuring announcements are made in mosques and at the local level to guide people to safety,” said PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia.
 
 

The provincial government urged citizens to cooperate fully with rescue agencies, avoid all recreational activities near water bodies, and immediately contact the PDMA helpline 1129 in case of an emergency.
With the new monsoon spell looming, the next 96 hours are critical for Punjab as it takes measures to relocate thousands of people living along the rivers.
GB survivors struggle
Meanwhile, the rain spell is also expected to bring heavy rain and flash floods to Gilgit-Baltistan — a region already reeling from successive floods over the past few weeks. A day earlier, a glacial flood in Tal­idas village rendered hundre­ds of people homeless, whe­r­eas the roads, including Shan­dur-Ghizer Road, across the mountainous region rema­in closed after landslides and floods.
Meanwhile, the survivors in the flood-hit areas faced a shortage of water for drinking and irrigation. Israruddin Israr, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan GB coordinator, said 330 households, comprising over 3,000 individuals, had become internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the recent glacial lake outburst flood in Talidas village in Ghizer district.
The number of IDPs in this incident is the second-largest since the 2010 Attabad disaster, he noted.  GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said residents of Talidas had been shifted to a tent settlement.
The GB chief minister also visited the affected area, Mr Faraq said, adding that the CM announced a cash reward for the shepherd who warned about the flood in time.
 
 

The GB government spokesperson said the shepherd will be invited to the Chief Minister’s Secretariat and a ceremony will be held in his honour. He said an alternative village would be established for the Glof-affected residents, and the prime minister would be approached for this initiative. The early warning system was not active in the Ghizer district, he admitted.
Former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman, in a statement, said they had reservations about the Glof-II project for early warning systems, installed by the UNDP across GB for Rs10 billion. He alleged these funds were misused and demanded an investigation into the system’s failure.

These include the January 6, 2021 attack by Donald Trump’s supporters on the Capitol Building in Washington DC; the February 8, 2022 attack on the National Congress Palace and the Supreme Court building in Brazil’s capital Brasília by supporters of Jair Bolsonaro; and the May 9, 2023 attacks on government and military facilities in Pakistan by supporters and leaders of Imran Khan’s party.
Two presidents (Trump and Bolsonaro) had lost re-election bids, and one former prime minister (Khan) had been arrested on corruption charges a year after he was ousted as PM through a no-confidence vote in the parliament. All three lamented that certain political and state elites had conspired to oust them.
After their ouster, they were accused of inciting their supporters to create havoc by striking against the ‘elites’ who had allegedly engineered their exit. Trump managed to dodge his accusers and return to the White House in 2024. But Khan has been in jail for over two years now, serving two prison sentences and facing additional cases.
He’s been barred from contesting elections for at least five years. Bolsonaro is under house arrest and facing a trial in which he can serve a 20 year (or more) prison sentence. He cannot contest an election till 2030.

From Washington DC and Brasília to Islamabad, populist uprisings have been framed as revolts of the people against ‘corrupt elites.’ In truth, these were clashes between rival elites, each cloaking its power struggle in the language of mass resistance

Trump’s survival in this regard — and his somewhat miraculous return to power — was mostly due to the manner in which his opponents understood his defeat in 2020. Despite Trump’s victory in 2016, they continued to comprehend Western democracy as being a self-correcting system that had course-corrected itself when Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020. To them, he was likely to slip into oblivion. They saw Trump’s first term (2016-2020) as a temporary bout of madness within American democracy. This was a naive analysis.
According to social physiologists J.P. Forgas and W.D. Crano, after populists acquire power, the movements that carried them into power may continue unabated, driven mostly by the ‘tribal’ allegiances and moral fervour of their followers.
Populist leaders who manage to get into power are aware of this. That’s why their rhetoric and actions don’t really change even when they become presidents or prime ministers. They want the movements to survive. Seeing themselves as ‘outsiders’, they are never able to feel secure in power. They keep their movements going so they can fall back on them if and when they’re ousted.
 
 

Since the movements that carry the populists to power remain active, they (the movements) become willing conduits of the reactive narratives of the ousted populists. The movements provide the populists foot soldiers for their ‘fight’ against the ‘corrupt elites’ that had ousted them. Trump, Bolsonaro and Khan all believed that the riots that they allegedly triggered would compel nervous state elites to restore them.
However, once the riots were brought under control, the state and the new governments in Brazil and Pakistan became aware of the role populist movements can play even after the core leaders of the movements had fallen. Therefore, in Brazil and Pakistan, such movements began being systematically dismantled, whereas Trump’s movement (‘Make America Great Again’) was allowed to regroup and regenerate itself.
 


All three movements discussed here claimed to be anti-elite. To Trump, the elites were the ‘deep state’, ‘establishmentarian politicians’ and ‘liberals’ (especially in the Democratic Party), and moderates within his own Republican Party. To Bolsonaro, mainstream leftist parties, secularists and the Supreme Court were the ‘evil elites.’ To Khan, ‘corrupt’ mainstream parties, ‘khooni liberals’ [murderous liberals] and, later, some Supreme Court judges and the military, were the detested elites.
In Brazil and Pakistan, those supporting Bolsonaro and Khan saw the February 2022 and May 2023 violence as ‘middle class uprisings’ against ruling elites, whereas in the US, those who were ransacking the Capitol Building believed a ‘people’s revolution’ was underway.
However, in the early 1990s, the American historian Christopher Lasch had explained populism as “the revolt of the elites.” The American anthropologist Arjun Appadurai expanded Lasch’s observation by writing that, if the 20th century was an era of ‘the revolt of the masses’, the 21st century has been the era of the ‘revolt of the elites.’
 
 

Such observations bother populists and their supporters. They like to be identified as the ‘masses’ or at least as a significant part of the masses. They really aren’t — considering that the term masses is usually identified with social and economic segments that are below the upper and the middle classes.
As a term, ‘masses’ was refigured by the middle classes in Europe and the US during the height of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century to mean the millions of people who began thronging urban centres to work in the ever-growing number of factories and lived in cramped conditions (slums). The ‘masses’ were not involved in the populist uprisings discussed here. Those who were at the forefront of the uprisings were what Appadurai calls the “new elite”, which was battling the established elites for political power.
When populists succeed in becoming presidents and prime ministers, an ‘alternative elite’ begins to take shape. It is largely given momentum by those wealthy businesspeople and sections of the middle classes that have developed tense social and political disagreements with other sections of the business and middle classes.
Modern-day populism is a fight between elites. So, during the three uprisings we’ve discussed here, when an alternative elite lost power, its leaders and supporters poured out not to ‘save democracy’, or carry on some noble mission. They rioted to save the power that their section of the elite had managed to grab, but then had lost.

The wheat crop, although harvested in March, came in below expectations, contributing to growing concerns.
Traders warn that wheat consumption in the livestock and poultry sectors has added to the supply pressure, as a significant amount of wheat has been diverted for animal feed. In addition, recent heavy rains, particularly in Karachi and the upcountry, have exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance for vegetables, leading to higher prices at markets.
As per the latest data from the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending Aug 21, the price of a 10kg wheat bag in Karachi has risen to Rs660, up from Rs640 at the start of August. Similarly, the cost of one kilogram of fine flour has increased to Rs95 from Rs93. The 20kg wheat flour bag now costs between Rs1,500 and Rs1,800, compared to Rs1,350 to Rs1,700 earlier this month.
 
 

Rauf Ibrahim, Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), highlighted that the wholesale price of wheat has surged to Rs72 per kg, up from Rs62 in July. When the Sindh wheat crop entered the market in March, it was priced at Rs55-56 per kg. This sharp rise in wheat prices has led to increases in flour prices as well, with wholesale rates for flour No. 2.5 and fine flour climbing from Rs74 and Rs79 per kg to Rs81 and Rs85, respectively.

Wheat consumption in livestock and poultry sectors adds to supply pressure

The trend is not confined to Karachi. Across the country, the national average prices for wheat flour have risen. A 20kg wheat flour bag now costs between Rs1,480 and Rs1,800, while the price for a 10kg wheat bag and one kilogram of fine flour have increased to Rs709 and Rs97.53, respectively.
Ibrahim further noted that retailers are likely to pass on an additional Rs10 per kg to consumers as the wholesale price of wheat rises. Despite the harvests from Sindh and Punjab earlier this year, a wheat crisis is beginning to emerge, with fears of a potential shortage looming.
 
 

It is estimated that between three and four million tonnes of wheat have already been consumed by the livestock sector, out of the 23 million tonnes harvested this year. This consumption, which has increa­sed ahead of Eidul Azha, is expected to continue. This is a sharp deviation from the original estimate of a 27 million tonne harvest, further straining wheat supply.
He criticised both federal and provincial governments for their delayed response to the rising wheat prices, warning that unless action is taken, flour prices could climb to Rs100 per kilogram, affecting the broader population. He called for a ban on the use of wheat in the livestock sector to prevent further shortages and urged the government to stockpile wheat in private and state-run warehouses to avoid a crisis.
Costly vegetables
In addition to wheat, the vegetable market in Karachi has also seen significant price hikes following recent rains. For example, tomato prices have surged to Rs200 per kg, up from Rs100-150 just days earlier, while onions have increased to Rs80 per kg from Rs50-60. Green onions have seen a dramatic increase, now priced at Rs500-600 per kilogram, up from Rs300. Other vegetables, such as bottle gourd and apple gourd, are being sold for Rs150 per kilogram, up from Rs80-100.
 
 

Haji Shajehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market at the New Sabzi Mandi Super Highway, attributed the rise in vegetable prices to supply disruptions caused by the rains. He also noted that some exporters are purchasing good-quality onions for export, further contributing to local price increases. He placed part of the blame on retailers who are overcharging consumers due to reduced supply from Sindh’s producing areas.
In the pulses market, there is a significant gap between wholesale and retail prices. The wholesale price for good quality Mash, Moong, Masoor, and Gram pulses ranges from Rs240 to Rs340 per kilogram, while retailers are charging Rs280-420 for the same products.With these ongoing price increases and the looming threat of further price hikes, consumers are feeling the impact, and many are concerned about the government’s ability to manage the situation.

According to official sources, the water level at Hub Dam rose significantly due to the recent monsoon rains, increasing from 322 feet to 333 feet.
Karachi faces severe water shortages, with a daily requirement of over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD) but currently receiving only around 650 MGD, officials said.
The Hub Dam supplies approximately 100 MGD to the Keamari and West districts, while the remainder is sourced from Keenjhar Lake.

Officials say additional six feet of water is required to reach dam’s maximum capacity of 339 feet

Officials also said that the dam’s maximum capacity is 339 feet and when filled to this level, it can supply water to the West, Keamari and Central districts of the city for up to three years.
When the dam reaches full capacity, excess water is released through a spillway to ensure safe drainage.
It is worth noting that the Hub Dam, completed in 1981, spans an area of 24,300 acres. To date, the dam has reached its full capacity 12 times. Last year, it reached the maximum level on Sept 1, after which the spillway was opened and water was released.
Experts believe that if monsoon rains continue, the dam may reach full capacity again in the coming days.
Officials welcomed the rise in the water level and described it as encouraging news for both the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and the city’s residents.
They added that the increased water reserves will play a crucial role in stabilising and improving Karachi’s water supply system.

Dealers indicated that while remittance inflows remain unaffected, with July witnessing $3.2 billion in transfers, the drop in open market sales could destabilise the exchange rate.
Money changers explained that the strict documentation requirements for dollar purchases are limiting their sales, with only transactions of up to $500 not raising any questions. According to bankers, the open market has sold around $115 million to the banking sector this month, significantly lower than the same period last year.
 
 

“The open market is running low on dollars. They are only selling what they receive from the public, which suggests that someone is purchasing dollars before selling them to money changers,” said a money changer, who requested anonymity.
While sales may rise this year, the money changers estimate that it is unlikely they will exceed $200m in sales for August. By comparison, the average monthly dollar sales by money changers stood at $350m during FY25, while July FY26 saw $300m in sales within the banking market.

Money changers report a 50pc drop in dollar sales this month

Money changers are also expressing concerns over the resurgence of illegal markets in major cities, where exchange rates are not fixed, ranging from Rs287 to Rs292. This has attracted individual sellers, as well as some buyers seeking dollars for tuition fees or medical expenses abroad. Despite the higher rates, it remains challenging to secure dollars for such legitimate needs.
The official dollar exchange rate has been falling against the Pakistani rupee following a crackdown on smugglers and illegal operators. Since the operation began, the dollar has dropped by Rs4 in the open market, from Rs288.50 on July 22 to Rs284.50 currently.
Bankers confirmed that the decline in open market sales is unrelated to government changes in incentives for banks and money changers. They also noted that remittance inflows remained robust in July. However, they pointed out that price controls could be allowing illegal market players to exploit the situation by offering higher rates, which could destabilise the exchange rate.
While the government has made efforts to reduce the dollar’s value, these measures have not had the desired effect. Despite the crackdown, the dollar’s price remains volatile in both the open and inter-bank markets.
Some analysts believe that the market could stabilise with higher foreign exchange reserves, continued remittance inflows, and improved relations with the US and China. They suggested that the State Bank should avoid large-scale dollar purchases, as it did in FY25, to ensure market liquidity and stability.

Yes, the killing fields of Gaza are seeing another weapon — starvation — being deployed, because the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF), under orders from the Netanyahu government, are not content with killing 60,000 people — a figure which its own database says included, in the first phase of the war, 83 per cent unarmed civilians. If the first phase set a trend that continues, then some 50,000 innocent civilians have been killed so far.
The blockade clamped by IOF, also known as IDF (Israeli Defence Forces), has triggered a famine. Malnutrition and death stalk the Strip as the UN says that one in five households, some half a million Gaza Palestinians, are facing an acute food and nutrition deficit, and one in three children or more are acutely malnourished. Similarly, two per 10,000 people are dying daily due to malnutrition and disease. Soul-destroying numbers, you’d agree.
 
 

The web-based +972 Magazine, run by Israeli and Palestinian journalists, has published a story based on the Israeli ministry of intelligence’s database, which says that of those killed by Israel in the first phase, only 17pc are identified as Hamas militants or other combatants. The rest were unarmed civilians. This when Israel was claiming a high ‘kill ratio’ of 50pc to 60pc of militants. The report also says of those killed, 60pc were women and children.
It seems that starvation and killings are not enough to achieve the goal of total and expeditious ethnic-cleansing of Gaza. So, Nobel Peace Prize aspirant US President Donald J. Trump has greenlit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Gaza occupation plan for which a 60,000-strong IOF force has been assembled. Reservists in multiples of that number are being recalled to duty.

There can be no doubt that the apartheid state enjoys unparalleled impunity to kill, maim and forcefully displace Palestinians.

This occupation plan and the UN designation of the situation in Gaza as a famine has stirred the conscience of ‘civilised and democratic’ Europe enough for its leaders to quickly issue perfunctory statements of disapproval — while continuing to supply the apartheid state with advanced weaponry, vital parts and other defence equipment.
There can be no doubt that the apartheid state enjoys unparalleled impunity to kill, maim and forcefully displace Palestinians not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank where settlers backed by IOF personnel have been on the rampage. The story of the Palestinians in Jerusalem is no different.
 
 

And this impunity extends to American soil too. Just Google to see how many Israeli paedophiles have been arrested by joint FBI Police and Homeland Security taskforces and then bailed out and allowed to return home. The story of the latest such incident was broken by independent journalist Shaun King on X.
Tom Alexandrovich was caught this month in a joint taskforce sting targeting paedophiles when he tried to lure a decoy underage girl for sex and used explicit language in his messages to her. A lot of reporting on the issue has been deleted by X but try and search for a video recorded by the Nevada law-enforcement officers where he is seen saying “Sorry, I didn’t mean to do anything”, in a daze, minutes after having been caught. When I checked last, it was there on the handle Ultras_antifaa on X.
While a lot of information is available online, this powerful man, who told law-enforcement officers he was in the US for meetings with the NSA and FBI, had a lot of content taken down by X and also wiped off other internet sites where the matter was being reported.
Why did he have such influence? Well, he heads the department in Israel which is behind the agency’s ‘take down’ requests to, for example, X. He is one of Netanyahu’s top aides and his social media profile says “Executive Director, Israel National Cyber Directorate, Building National Cyber Security, AI for Defence, Threat Intelligence (CTI), Aviation Security”.
King reported that taskforce officers involved in the sting operation and arrest confirmed to him that the “Trump administration personally intervened, at Israel’s request, to override US law enforcement, including their own federal agents involved in the sting, to make sure Alexandrovich got back to Israel quickly and safely”. The officers confirmed that the arrested man did not have a diplomatic visa or any kind of diplomatic immunity.
 
 

Alexandrovich’s department works in close coordination with NSO, the developer of the Pegasus spying software that governments around the world use to snoop on confidential conversations of their own citizens as well as foes. In all likelihood, the department snoops on foreign players and governments. He has also posted about making presentations to Netanyahu on projects to protect his country and undermine the adversaries.
Now imagine if the citizen of any other country was caught while attempting to lure a minor for sex. The US has cancelled the student visas and ruined the lives of a large number of foreign students for merely exercising their freedom to protest peacefully against Israeli atrocities in Gaza. It has also blocked visas to overseas students admitted to US colleges because their social media timelines show them to be critical of Israel.
And in the US, the Nevada state attorney, whose personal social media account (since deleted) had multiple posts supporting Israeli actions and the annihilation of Palestinians and the Clark County district attorney (both US-Israeli dual nationals) played their part in freeing a man charged with a serious offence that carries a jail term of up to 10 years. They happily complied with the Trump administration’s request and freed him on bail.
This story is shared here because you are unlikely to have read it on Western media, the self-proclaimed citadel of free speech. The purpose of sharing this was also to underline the sort of leverage the apartheid state has over the US. The one major consequence is the fate of Palestine and the Palestinians.

The Gilgit-Baltistan Bar Council, GB Supreme Court Bar Association, GB High Court Bar Association and District Bar Associations had jointly given the call for protest.
HCBA Secretary General Advocate Islamuddin told Dawn that lawyers in the region had been protesting for the past 10 months, boycotting court proceedings and holding rallies. They had also blocked the River View Road.
The protesting lawyers said they had been demanding their rights, including the long-delayed induction of judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, the establishment of special courts such as family and consumer courts, advertisement of vacant civil judge posts, and the separation of judicial magistrate from civil judge positions in line with practice elsewhere in the country, with appointments made from the legal fraternity on merit.

The legal fraternity sought judicial reforms, appointments and court expansion

They also demanded financial grants and allotment of plots to GB lawyers, appointments of legal advisers in government and non-government organisations, extension of the Lawyers Protection Act to GB, and separation of the offices of prosecutor general and advocate general.
A delegation of lawyers met GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Friday to discuss the issues. Senior lawyer Asadullah Khan, who led the delegation, said the lawyers also expressed reservations about the appointment of retired judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court.
He said judges elevated from the GB Chief Court to the GB Supreme Appellate Court should not hear cases they had previously adjudicated in the Chief Court. He added that lawyers also demanded the appointment of judges to vacant posts in the GB Supreme Appellate Court from within the legal fraternity on merit.
According to him, the chief minister agreed to send a summary to the prime minister regarding the appointment of lawyers as judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, as well as to the federal government for creating new positions for law officers in GB.
“The GB chief minister also agreed to implement other demands that fall within the GB government’s domain,” said Mazhar Hussain Advocate, president of the Gilgit District Bar. He said that the delay in appointing judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, GB Chief Court and lower courts had badly affected the delivery of justice.
He added that GB lawyers’ demands were in the interest of the general public, pointing out that no judges had been appointed to the GB Supreme Appellate Court for the last eight years, leaving thousands of important cases pending. He said the lawyers’ movement had become an example of unity.
“The lawyers have proven that they will not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the rule of law and justice,” he said, adding that appointments in the higher and subordinate judiciary, establishment of new courts, and creation and filling of posts for law officers were the main points of the lawyers’ charter of demands.
After the government accepted the demands, Advocate Amjad Hussain, a member of the GB Assembly, announced the decisions at the sit-in venue. He said the GB lawyers had been struggling for the last 10 months and that their demands had now been accepted.

The National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA), in collaboration with Al-Khidmat Foundation, has dispatched the humanitarian relief consignment for the people of the Gaza Strip.
Officials from the Pakistan Embassy in Cairo received the consignment and handed it over to the Egyptian Red Crescent Society for onward delivery to Palestinian citizens inside Gaza.
The consignment, arranged by Al-Khidmat Foundation, inclu­ded flour, ready-to-eat meals, cooking oil, jam, and fruit cocktails. It was sent via chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore.
According to Pakistan’s embassy, the government and people of Pakistan, with the commendable contribution of Al-Khidmat Foundation, will continue to extend much-needed humanitarian assistance to their Palestinian brethren.
 
 

With this shipment, the total humanitarian assistance provided by Pakistan to Gaza residents has reached 1,915 tonnes. More consignments are scheduled for dispatch in the coming days.
Earlier, a send-off ceremony was held at the Lahore airport, attended by Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, along with officials from NDMA and Al-Khidmat Foundation.

Meanwhile, the agency also taken into custody three human traffickers in separate operations in Taftan.
A spokesperson for FIA said that the operation was conducted on the directives of FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja as part of a crackdown on networks enga­ged in hawala and illegal money transfers.
The arrested suspects were identified as Muhammad Umar, Lal Muhammad, and Abdul Wali.
 
 

Officials said a total of Rs1.7 million was recovered from the accused, along with four mobile phones, registers, and other evidence related to hawala/hundi dealings. The suspects, who failed to provide satisfactory explanations regarding the seized currency, were taken into custody and further investigation has been initiated.
Human traffickers held
Meanwhile, the FIA spokesman said that the agency also arrested three human traffickers in separate operations in Taftan and took four Bangladeshi nationals into custody.
In one operation, FIA Taftan staff launched a raid after receiving intelligence about a gang involved in smuggling people illegally to Iraq via Iran.
During the raid, the agency arrested a notorious trafficker, Muhammad Adnan Aslam, who was linked to an organised network operating from Iraq. He was accused of smuggling Pakistani citizens through illegal rou-tes into Iran and onward to Iraq.

The judge was attending a documentary screening organised by rights group Defence for Human Rights Pakistan, where he delivered remarks to attendees and noted that cases regarding missing persons and disappearances were the most difficult he had come across.
Addressing the gathering, Justice Minallah said that when he ordered that disappearances be investigated or missing people be found, “the authorities would come and they would all say that we don’t know where they are.”
At this, the judge pointed out: “The judge and the court cannot do anything when you don’t have independent investigators.”
Minallah added: “Every judge of the Supreme Court is responsible personally for every violation of fundamental rights that takes place in Pakistan.”
The judge recounted an instance when he suddenly heard the sound of a child crying in his courtroom. Upon asking his staff, the child came forward with his grandmother.
“That was Mudassar Naaru’s child,” Minallah said, referring to the journalist who went missing in 2018. “His mother had passed away and the state had failed to at least let them know whether he was alive, he was dead, or where he was.
“Yes, I wanted to sensitise the issue because there was nothing else that I could do and I would go by the constitution,” he added.
“Under the Constitution, the executive head is the prime minister. I passed an order that this child and his grandmother be taken to the then-prime minister of Pakistan.
“It’s very, very difficult for the courts when the state is not cooperating with you. But the Constitution says that it is the prime minister, the cabinet and then the provinces, the chief minister and the ministers who are responsible. You can’t blame someone else.”
Minallah recalled that he summoned the then-PM to appear in court. “Naaru’s son was also there. He (the prime minister) also assured that child [in court], that his (Naaru’s) whereabouts would be known,” he stated.
“Well, I was in haste elevated to the Supreme Court. But before that, let me say to you, the Islamabad High Court, the first priority was to have competent and fearless judges,” Minallah said. “And for a judge or for a court, the only test is the confidence of the people in that court.”
 
 

The judge noted that it was the duty of the state to investigate these incidents and hold people accountable. Recalling the first judgment he gave, he stated that the directions he gave were “extremely effective during the four-year period that I served as the chief justice”.
“I had made it very clear to the executive that I will not tolerate a single incident of enforced disappearance from within my jurisdiction,” he said.
“But let me say a word. As a judge, I have always respected the parliament and the elected representatives,” he continued. “They have been victims for the past 77 years.”
However, the judge said that in his experience, “those who are in the government … don’t want to be told that this is an issue. And they also want to pretend that this is not an issue. It is an issue.
“It is for the political leadership. When they are in opposition, they are absolutely different.”
Minallah said that during the four years he served as the Islamabad High Court’s chief justice, students from Balochistan would approach the court about disappearances in the province.
“I knew I didn’t have the jurisdiction, but I assumed the jurisdiction,” he said, noting that the Supreme Court and other courts were there.
“When the Balochistan students came, I didn’t know what to do because it was out of my jurisdiction. The investigations had to take place in Balochistan. But the law did provide me with that jurisdiction.”
The judge urged the need for an independent judiciary, adding that the fact that women from Balochistan had to march in the streets for rights was a matter of “shame” for everyone and him.
Concluding his speech, he said: “Those holding exalted offices, I am afraid they haven’t spoken truth in the last 77 years. The day they start speaking the truth, things will change. We have heard some sitting ministers, some former ministers. I wish one day they will also speak the truth because we all know the truth. Everyone knows the truth, but we pretend that we do not know the truth.”
Earlier this week, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the National Judicial Policy Making Committee that a mechanism for producing detained people in cases of enforced disappearances would be presented before the body in its next meeting.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”.
The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-08-24 03:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24074845ade17e0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936335/iranian-forces-kill-six-militants' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian forces kill six militants</strong></a><br><p>TEHRAN: Iranian for­ces killed six militants in a raid in the restive southeast, saying they were members of a  “terrorist” group linked to Israel.
“During an intense exchange of fire with terrorists in Sistan-Baluch­istan province, six assailants were killed and two others arrested,” official news agency IRNA said, citing a statement from the intelligence services.
Sistan-Baluchistan, which borders Pakistan and Afg­hanistan, has long been a flashpoint for clashes bet­ween security forces and armed groups.
The news agency said there were “documents” indicating  “the Zionist nature” of the group targeted in the latest raid, adding that its members had planned to attack a  “vital” facility in Iran’s east, without elaborating.
The report said that “the main operation team” was composed of “seven non-Iranian terrorists”, but did not specify their nationality.
Two intelligence agents and a police officer were wounded in the gunfight.

In an interview with The Times newspaper, Farage said he would withdraw Britain from the Euro­pean Convention on Human Rights and sign deals with Afghanistan, Eritrea and other top countries of origin to repatriate illegal migrants.
“We can be nice to people, we can be nice to other countries, or we can be very tough to other countries … I mean (US President Donald) Trump has proved this point quite comprehensively,” Farage said.
Asked if he was concerned that asylum seekers would be killed or tortured if they were sent to countries with poor human rights records, Farage said he was more worried about the threat he believed asylum seekers posed to Britons.

Small-scale protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers have become frequent

“I can’t be responsible for despotic regimes all over the world. But I can be responsible for the safety of women and girls on our streets,” he said.
Britain has seen regular small-scale protests in recent weeks outside hotels housing asylum seekers, spurred in part by concerns about public safety after some migrants were charged with sexual assault.
 
 

Broader opinion polls show that immigration and asylum are the public’s greatest concern, just ahead of the economy, and Reform UK — which won five seats at last year’s general election — has topped recent voting intention polls.
Last year 37,000 people — mostly from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea — arrived in Britain from France by crossing the English Channel in small boats. The total was up by a quarter from 2023 and accounted for nine per cent of net migration.
About two-thirds of people who arrive via small boats and claim asylum are successful and only three per cent have been deported, according to figures analysed by the University of Oxford.
Farage told The Times he would end the right to claim asylum or to challenge deportation for those who arrived by small boats by replacing existing human rights legislation and opting Britain out of refugee treaties, citing a national emergency.
“The aim of this legislation is mass deportation,” Farage said, adding that a “massive crisis” caused by asylum-seekers was fuelling public anger.
The Times said Farage wanted to create holding facilities for 24,000 migrants on air bases at a cost of 2.5 billion pounds ($3.4bn) and operate five deportation flights a day, with total deportations reaching the hundreds of thousands.
If that failed, asylum seekers could be held on Ascension Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic, to send a symbolic message, Farage said.

Footage from Gaza’s largest city, which Israel plans to seize as part of an ex­­panded military operation, showed wo­men and children among the chaotic jostle of dozens clamouring and shouting for food.
One young boy used his hands to scrape a few leftover grains from the inside of a cooking vat. A girl sat on the edge of a tent and scooped rice from a plastic bag on the ground.
“We have no home left, no food, no income… so we are forced to turn to charity kitchens, but they do not satisfy our hunger,” said Yousef Hamad, 58, who was displaced from the northern city of Beit Hanoun.

The chief of UN agency for Palestinian refugees asks Israel to ‘stop denying the famine it has created’

Further south at a charity kitchen in Deir el Balah, 34-year-old Umm Mohammad said the UN’s declaration of a famine had come “far too late”. The children are  “staggering from dizziness, unable to wake up because of the lack of food and water”, she added.
 
 

The UN officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming the “systematic obstruction” of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of conflict. The Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.
‘Moral duty’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the famine report as “an outright lie”.
On Saturday, the head of the UN agen­­cy for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it was “time for the government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza”.
“All of those who have influence must use it with determination & a sense of moral duty,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X.
 






The IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of Sept­ember, covering around two-thirds of Gaza. Israel kept up its bombardment of the Palestinian territory, with a footage sho­wing heavy smoke billowing above the Zeitoun district of Gaza City as Pales­ti­nians picked through the wreckage of buildings.
‘Feel like end is near’
The spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mahmud Bassal, called the situation in the Sabra and Zeitoun neighbourhoods “absolutely catastrophic”, describing the “complete levelling of entire residential blocks”.
“We are trapped here, living in fear, with nowhere to go. There’s no safety anywhere in Gaza. Movement now leads to death,” said Ahmad Jundiyeh, 35, who was displaced to the northern outskirts of Zeitoun. “We constantly hear the sound of bombing… we hear fighter jets, artillery shelling and even drone explosions,” he said. “We’re extremely afraid — it feels like the end is near.”
Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed on Friday that Israel would destroy Gaza City as it has other parts of the territory if Hamas did not agree to disarm, release all remaining prisoners and “end the war on Israel’s terms”.
Residents of Gaza City said the Israeli strikes targeting the area had been relentless for days. “Let them come and see what’s happening to us here on the ground in Zeitoun district. We have been ruined,” said Aymen Daloul, a 53-year-old from Gaza City whose home had been destroyed.
“We shall sleep on the streets as if we were cattle. Have mercy on us.”
Mahmud Abu Saqer, 24, said there had been a quickening exodus of residents ever since Israel announced its plans to seize Gaza City. “Just this morning, more than 500 to 600 families left, and yesterday thousands left,” he said.

• Omar says PkMAP chief’s nomination to boost opposition alliance
ISLAMABAD: Amid controversy surrounding the nomination of Mahmood Khan Achakzai — the head of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party — and Senator Azam Swati as opposition leaders, PTI insiders have said these appointments will only proceed if former leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz remain barred from parliament.
The party plans to avail all legal options to reverse the disqualification of National Assembly Oppo­s­ition Leader Omar Ayub and Senate opposition leader Shibli Faraz, who were disqualified by the  Election Commission of Pakis­tan in light of the May 9 sentences.
Against this backdrop, the PTI chief earlier this week named Mr Achakzai, who also heads the PTI-led opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, and Senator Swati for these coveted roles. The decision, however, upset many in the party, and a debate ensued over why an outsider was picked to lead the PTI-dominated opposition.
In an apparent move to placate these concerns, insiders in the party told Dawn that the priority was the return of former opposition leaders Omar Ayub and Mr Faraz.
According to PTI’s political com­m­ittee, new nominations will not be made until the appeals of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz are decided. Party Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that the party would stand by the two leaders, hoping that the court would give a favourable ruling in their cases.
Meanwhile, Omar Ayub told Dawn that the new appointment would be finalised only after exhausting all legal means.
“However, it should be kept in mind that Mr Achakzai is a senior leader and also the head of the opposition alliance,” he said, adding, “It is the prerogative of the party founder [Imran Khan] to nominate any person as a candidate for the opposition leader.” Mr Ayub said the decision to nominate the PkMAP chief would strengthen the opposition alliance.
Ex-opposition leader Omar Ayub said that Salman Akram Raja had already made it clear that all the legal platforms would be used to reverse their disqualification but if the government demanded the names for new opposition leaders, in that case, these names would be forwarded to the speaker.
A senior PTI leader, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that although both names were announced, but during the parliamentary party meeting, participants demanded the details of the meeting with Imran Khan.
“Ali Bukhari informed (the meeting) that Imran Khan had said that all legal platforms should be exhausted and after that names of Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati can be given. Khan sahib suggested these names as he feared he might not get an opportunity to meet the party leaders, his sisters, or lawyers till the nomination of the opposition leaders,” he explained.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz had gotten stay orders from courts. “Mr Achakzai was supported by the PTI as a presidential candidate. Imran Khan wants all opposition voices to unite. In the past, we approached Maulana Fazlur Rehman under the same idea and visited his house many times,” he said.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that the first priority was to bring both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back to the NA and Senate.
“However, as a second option, Mr Achakzai has been nominated,” he said, adding the PkMAP chief was named for this role because Mr Khan supported political figures from Balochistan. Mr Achakzai is also a seasoned politician who can lead the movement, he said. “However, I would again say that the priority would be to bring Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back as leaders of the opposition in both houses,” he reiterated.
It may be noted that Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment. Swati, a PTI veteran who joined the party before the 2013 elections, was jailed a few years ago and allegedly tortured for his tweet against then army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.
