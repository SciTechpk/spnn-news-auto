<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/141930383f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955071/fo-says-no-knowledge-of-pms-coordinator-interacting-with-israeli-ministry-official-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>FO says ‘no knowledge’ of PM’s coordinator interacting with Israeli ministry official in London</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday said it had “no information” about the prime minister’s coordinator on tourism, Sardar Yasir Ilyas, interacting with an Israeli ministry official in London.
The spokesperson was asked about the incident after a video of the interaction began circulating on social media. It was filmed during the World Travel Market event in London, which took place from November 4 to 6, 2025.
In the clip, Ilyas could be seen shaking hands with and conversing with an individual later identified as the Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Tourism, Michael Izhar-Kov.
A translation of Israeli journalist Rai Kais’ X post in Hebrew said: “As you may recall, Pakistan was recently mentioned as one of the countries that may join the international force in Gaza.”
 






However, London-based journalist Murtaza Ali Shah claimed in a post on X that “a group of individuals from Israel visited the Pakistan Pavilion unannounced and met the Pakistani delegation without introducing themselves.”
 






Asked during a weekly press briefing about the interaction, the FO spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said: “I have no information on this meeting. The gentleman you referred to is a public figure. I would request you to ask him about the meeting. I have no information on this.”
In a subsequent question on the matter, he said: “I have not seen the report or any information on a meeting of the adviser to the prime minister or any public figure with an Israeli representative. I can assure you that if such a meeting or interaction took place, it was, certainly, without authorisation by the government.”
The FO spokesperson was later asked about previous reports of alleged visits by Pakistani delegations, to which he said: “I can tell you with a certain assurance that they were not authorised or under information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If these individuals have violated any passport regulations pertaining to travel to a country disallowed on Pakistan passport, our authorities ought to look into it. I have no information, and I can tell you that these visits or these interactions with Israel are not authorised.”
 






Reacting to the video, former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan wrote on X, “Shaking hands with the killers of Palestinians is a betrayal of Al-Aqsa, Gaza, and the Palestinians. The handshake, meeting, and conversation during the international exhibition in London between Sardar Yasir Ilyas, Advisor to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Tourism, and Michael Izhar-Kov, Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Tourism.”
He added: “The visit of the Israeli director-general of tourism to the Pakistani pavilion — this is shameful, it is rubbing salt into the wounds of Pakistanis.
I condemn this in the strongest terms; the nation will not forgive the traitors of the Palestinian people.”
 






Renowned writer Fatima Bhutto chimed in: “Disgusting treason. Shaking hands dripping with the blood of Palestinians.”
 






Meanwhile, PTI leader and ex-human rights minister Shireen Mazari questioned: “It is not when it happened but how it happened!”
 






‘No decision on participation in Int’l Stabilisation Force’
The FO spokesperson was also asked about Pakistan’s participation in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. Last month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and was “in process”.
Today, the spokesperson said that “no decision has been taken as yet on Pakistan’s participation.”
“The exact role or mandate of the International Stabilisation Force itself is under discussion at the UN Security Council. I do not think a decision has been taken by the Security Council yet. So, this is an evolving process,” Andrabi clarified.
He continued: “We are engaged with it in a sense that Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and is undertaking these negotiations as a Security Council member. So, we await the Security Council’s decision.
And as indicated earlier, Pakistan’s participation in the stabilisation force will be decision taken at the highest level, including through participation of the Parliament.“
Last month, Pakistan, in a joint statement with 14 other nations, condemned Tel Aviv’s attempt to impose “Israeli sovereignty” over the occupied West Bank, after the Israeli parliament passed bills on annexing the West Bank, according to FO.
A few days later, the information ministry had also denied claims of the country removing the clause from its passports that makes it invalid for travel to Israel.
Pakistan continues to maintain that it does not recognise Israel and steadfastly supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1422194106073d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955055/no-confidence-moved-in-ajk-assembly-ppp-nominates-rathore-for-pm' target='_blank'><strong>No confidence moved in AJK Assembly; PPP nominates Rathore for PM</strong></a><br><p>A resolution for a vote of no confidence was submitted to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative Assembly’s special secretary, Amjed Latif Abbasi on Friday.
On October 27, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira announced that his party and the PML-N had agreed on bringing a no-confidence motion against the government in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members.
Earlier today, the PPP put forward the name of Faisal Rathore as their nominee for the position of the prime minister of the territory, its AJK party president said.
The resolution was handed over to Abbasi by PPP lawmakers Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Sardar Javed Ayoub, Malik Zafar Iqbal and Chaudhry Ali Shan Soni.
Assembly Secretary Chaudhry Basharat Hussain — a relative of AJK PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — did not attend office on Friday.
The resolution signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N — its regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir and his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider — accused Mr Haq of having “lost the trust of the Legislative Assembly”.
“We, the undersigned members of the Legislative Assembly, in accordance with Article 18(4) of the Interim Constitution, hereby submit a no-confidence motion, holding that the current Prime Minister [Chaudhry] Anwarul Haq has not only lost the trust of the Legislative Assembly but has also inflicted serious damage upon the constitutional, ideological, and democratic framework of the state, through his style of governance, political narrative, and confrontational conduct,” it read.
“We, the proposers, recognise Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the nominee for prime minister and call for the earliest completion of the electoral process in accordance with constitutional and democratic requirements, so that the continuity of government formation remains intact,” the resolution added.
The resolution had left the section naming the proposed new leader blank while signatures were being collected. Rathore’s name was later handwritten into the document before submission.
Additionally, 19 of the 25 signatories were members of Haq’s own cabinet, and none resigned even after filing the no-confidence motion.
When a reporter asked Malik Zafar Iqbal as to why they had not resigned, he said: “Our decisions are taken by our central leadership, and as yet no such directive has been issued.”
Meanwhile, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar summoned the Legislative Assembly to meet at 3pm on Monday to vote on the resolution.
PPP AJK President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, while speaking to the media earlier today outside Zardari House in Islamabad, along with PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf, said, “Our chairman has decided… that Faisal Rathore, who is the General Secretary of our party in AJK, will be nominated for the position of PM.”
He detailed that “we are going to table the vote of no confidence today, so god willing, in the next few days, PPP will have its government in AJK.
“The voting will begin on Monday,” he later said in response to a question.
“Faisal Rathore is an educated young man; he has a lot of experience and has been part of the assembly before,” Raja Pervez said.
Before announcing the nomination, Ashraf told the media that the party had taken an “excellent decision”, reaffirming that the PPP “remains committed to the people of Kashmir”.
“Right now, we want to ease their hardships and pave the way for the next elections,” he said.
Chaudhry echoed similar thoughts, stating that the generations of party leaders had “always taken a strong stance on Kashmir”.
Before making the announcement, Chaudhry said, “We have the required number (in the legislative assembly), I feel that we have the golden number.”
Ashraf told the media that PPP was the “largest parliamentary party (in the legislative assembly) and we have the support of our allies.”
He expressed confidence that his party “is in the position to form the government,” noting that they had the required “strength.”
He continued: “PPP will bring peace to Kashmir and ease their hardships; the promises made to the Action Committee will be fulfilled as well.”
On October 28, sources had told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Rathore and Sardar Yaqub were under consideration for the top slot.
Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister.
Who is Faisal Rathore?
A senior figure in PPP’s AJK chapter, Rathore has long been associated with the region’s politics.
Born on April 11, 1978, in Rawalpindi, he is the son of the late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, a former AJK prime minister who also served as senior minister, leader of the opposition and speaker of the Legislative Assembly at various stages of his political career.
His mother, Begum Farhat Rathore, belonged to a migrant family from Indian-occupied Kashmir; she was a member of the state legislature and headed the PPP Women’s Wing.
The Rathore family, based in AJK’s remote Haveli district, is regarded among the founding political families of the PPP in Azad Kashmir.
Rathore completed his early education in Rawalpindi and graduated from the University of the Punjab. After the death of his father, his elder brother Masood Mumtaz Rathore was elected to the AJK Legislative Assembly in 1999 for the remainder of the term.
He first entered electoral politics in 2006 from LA-17 Haveli Kahuta. He won his first assembly seat in the 2011 general elections on a PPP ticket and later served in the cabinet of then prime minister Chaudhry Abdul Majeed as minister for AJK Logging and Sawmills Corporation and minister for electricity.
In 2016, he was arrested in what was widely viewed as a politically motivated case but was subsequently exonerated.
The politician was appointed secretary general of the PPP AJK chapter on March 23, 2017, a position he continues to hold.
In the 2021 elections, he returned to the assembly and remained an active voice on the opposition benches.
In 2023, Rathore joined the coalition government led by Chaudhry Anwarul Haq as minister for Local Government and Rural Development and was also tasked with heading the government’s negotiation committee with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee.
Known for his soft-spoken, conciliatory and non-controversial disposition, he is seen as a figure who maintains working relationships across political and administrative circles.
He has also worked in national media, hosting a regular programme on a private TV channel.
Within the PPP, he is considered a trusted confidant of Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Faryal Talpur and is viewed as a representative of the party’s ideological and middle-class cadre.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1422170493e5041.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955077/several-killed-as-stockholm-bus-slams-into-pedestrians' target='_blank'><strong>Several killed as Stockholm bus slams into pedestrians</strong></a><br><p>Several people were killed and others injured when a bus rammed into a bus stop queue in central Stockholm during Friday’s afternoon rush hour, police said.
Shortly after the crash, images in Swedish media showed a swarm of police, ambulances and emergency vehicles at the scene, with rescue crews crouched down along the underside of the double-decker bus, appearing to help people trapped underneath.
“There are both injured and deceased people in the incident. Police are for the moment not commenting on the number, gender or ages of the victims,” said a police statement.
Health authorities spokeswoman Michelle Marcher told AFP that two seriously injured people had been transported to the hospital.
Police spokesperson Nadya Norton said the cause of the accident was still unknown.
“The investigation will have to determine what happened. It’s too early to say and I don’t want to speculate,” she told AFP.
She said the bus driver had been arrested and a manslaughter investigation had been opened as a matter of routine.
“We need to question him, then we’ll see if he’s going to be released or detained,” Norton said.
Police received the first reports of the accident at 3:23pm (1423 GMT).
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.
“I have received the tragic news that several people have died and been injured at a bus stop in central Stockholm,” he wrote on X.
“People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones.”
 


‘Chaos’
A woman identified as Michelle Mac Key told the daily Expressen she stepped off another bus at the scene just after the accident happened.
“I crossed the road and saw the double-decker bus that had mowed down an entire bus stop queue,” she said.
People were screaming and trying to help the injured.
She said she saw both injured and dead people lying on the ground.
“There must have been more people under the bus,” she said.
A nurse by profession, she and another man, who was a doctor, offered their help to the police when they arrived.
“They told us to stand next to the dead bodies,” she said.
“I thought it was an exercise at first. That maybe they were dolls. It was so unreal. Chaos.”
Another woman who lives in the neighbourhood told daily Aftonbladet she heard a loud crash.
“I was lying in bed in my room, heard a loud crash and I heard several people scream. I ran to the window and saw a bus that had crashed and several people lying on the ground,” said the woman, who was not identified by name.
Two hours after the crash, a section of the busy Valhallavagen avenue was still blocked off.
Police technicians were working at the scene but emergency vehicles had left.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14201749971f620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955073/health-ministry-who-warn-1-in-3-adults-are-affected-by-diabetes' target='_blank'><strong>Health ministry, WHO warn 1 in 3 adults are affected by diabetes</strong></a><br><p>The health ministry and the World Health Organisation warned on Friday that one in three adults in the country was affected by diabetes.
In a press release issued on World Diabetes Day, both warned that “diabetes affects 34.5 million people in Pakistan, including one in three adults. Pakistan has the highest diabetes burden globally — in percentage terms — and hosts more than 40 per cent of the total estimated cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.”
They said they were partnering to organise special diabetes screening activities in medical facilities, urging people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and encouraging the early detection of a “silent killer that can affect people of any age”.
 
 

The press release said that four in 10 people affected by diabetes in the region were not aware of it, increasing their risk of serious health complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
It added that Type 2 diabetes could be prevented and the consequences of all types of diabetes minimised or delayed by maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, detecting the disease early, seeking treatment when needed, avoiding tobacco and reducing sugar intake.
“Today, we observe World Diabetes Day to highlight the rising burden of diabetes in Pakistan. The Ministry of Health, through the Prime Minister’s Diabetes Programme, is promoting early detection, free screening and healthier lifestyles. I urge all citizens to know their risk, get tested and take simple steps like healthy eating and physical activity,” Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal was quoted as saying in the press release.
Meanwhile, WHO representative and Head of Mission in Pakistan Dr Luo Dapeng said: “Diabetes is a silent killer, but we can all do our part to protect ourselves and our families by adopting a healthy lifestyle and regular medical checkups.
“Prevention is always the best cure, and WHO will stand with Pakistan and its people to combat a disease that can be prevented or minimised through early detection and timely treatment.”
The press release concluded that globally, the number of people living with diabetes rose from 200m in 1990 to 830m in 2022, adding that the disease was rising more rapidly in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.</p><small>2025-11-14 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14214217a9151d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955075/rna-recovered-from-siberian-mammoth-that-died-39000-years-ago' target='_blank'><strong>RNA recovered from Siberian mammoth that died 39,000 years ago</strong></a><br><p>Scientists have recovered the oldest-known RNA, a molecule necessary for most biological functions, from a woolly mammoth that inhabited Siberia about 39,000 years ago, showing it can last longer than previously known and promising a new path for studying organisms that lived long ago.
The RNA, successfully isolated and sequenced, was extracted from muscle tissue in the left front leg of a juvenile male mammoth, perhaps five to 10 years old, whose carcass was discovered in 2010 in the Siberian permafrost in the Russian Far East along the Oyogos Yar coast bordering the Laptev Sea.
The mammoth, given the name Yuka, represents one of the best-preserved frozen carcasses of this extinct species. Its RNA, among other things, revealed which genes had been “turned on” in Yuka’s tissue around the time of death, showing signs of cell stress.
Most knowledge about prehistoric organisms comes from studying skeletal fossils, but there is a limit to what these can reveal about their biology. The growing ability to recover telltale biomolecules from ancient remains, however, has offered new ways to understand such organisms.
The new RNA achievement complements advances in recent years in the study of ancient DNA, the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms, and ancient proteins, the molecules that build and run much of a cell’s machinery.
RNA, short for ribonucleic acid, serves as the messages sent from an organism’s genome to its cellular machinery, telling cells which genes to activate or deactivate, how and when to regulate their function and which proteins to make.
“With RNA, you can access the actual biology of the cell or tissue happening in real time within the last moments of life of the organism,” said Emilio Mrmol, a geneticist, veterinarian and bioinformatician at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute, lead author of the study published on Friday in the journal Cell.
“This gives us direct access to the functional landscape of the cell metabolism of woolly mammoths when they were alive, something that is not possible, at least not in the lengths we report, just by using DNA or proteins. Adding this layer of information provides a more comprehensive view to the biology of woolly mammoths,” Mrmol said.
RNA is more fragile than DNA and proteins. The oldest DNA recovered to date was from animals, plants and microbes dating to about 2 million years ago from sediment in Greenland. The oldest proteins came from dental remains of a hornless rhinoceros that lived about 23 million years ago in the Canadian High Arctic.
Until now, the oldest RNA recovered was from a wolf cub that lived in Siberia about 14,000 years ago.
“I think the key finding is that we can recover RNA from such an old sample. It’s a proof of principle that opens the door for much more detailed analyses of gene expression patterns in Ice Age megafauna,” said geneticist and study co-author Love Daln of Stockholm University and the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden.
Yuka experienced trauma before death, with deep cuts on its hide indicating an attack by a cave lion, an extinct species that was a cold-adapted and bulkier cousin of today’s African lion.
“None of the marks are severe enough to have caused the death, so it is still a bit unclear why Yuka died,” Daln said.
The researchers detected RNA molecules in Yuka that code for proteins involved in muscle contraction and metabolic regulation under stress, possibly but not necessarily stemming from this attack.
Scientists long thought RNA degrades mere minutes or hours after death, but this study and others showed that under the right circumstances, it can survive much longer. The frigid conditions of Siberia were particularly conducive to RNA preservation.
Yuka’s DNA has also been sequenced by these researchers and others previously. Previously thought to have been female, the genetic data showed that Yuka, which stood about 5-1/4 feet (1.6 meters) at the shoulder, was male, with an X and a Y chromosome.
The researchers believe that under the right conditions, RNA can be recovered from even older remains, noting that ancient RNA offers numerous possibilities.
“We hope our work elicits a renewed interest in exploring RNA in other old remains, not necessarily from the Ice Age or extinct species, but also from medieval or historical remains of both extinct and extant organisms,” Mrmol said.</p><small>2025-11-14 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/141517507571a1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955058/no-mention-of-27th-amendment-in-sc-full-court-meeting-called-after-judges-letters-to-cjp-yahya' target='_blank'><strong>No mention of 27th Amendment in SC full court meeting called after judges’ letters to CJP Yahya</strong></a><br><p>There was no discussion on the 27th Amendment in a full court meeting called by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday, according to a Supreme Court (SC) press release.
It was reported a day ago that after a series of letters seeking a full court meeting on the contentious amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday, the CJP called one today.
According to the press release issued after the meeting, the participants “unanimously updated the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 on the recommendation of the committee, comprising Hon’ble Justice Shahid Waheed, Hon’ble Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Hon’ble Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Hon’ble Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, constituted under Rule 1(4) of Order I of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 for removal of difficulties arising in giving effect to its provisions”.
It said the meeting extended “sincere appreciation to each member of the committee individually for undertaking such a massive task of meticulously reviewing the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, drafting the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 and addressing the suggestions thereon for removal of difficulties”.
“The updated Supreme Court Rules, 2025, are to improve service delivery and ensure inexpensive and expeditious administration of justice,” it added.
Moreover, the full court meeting also unanimously approved the grant of the status of senior advocate of the Supreme Court to Muhammad Munir Paracha — who was an advocate of the SC until now —  in terms of Rule 5 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
Letters by SC judges
Yesterday, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar became the third judge SC to request a full court to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary.
“From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”.
Before the bill for the constitutional amendment was passed, Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah — both of whom tendered their resignations yesterday following the enactment of the 27th Amendment — had written separate letters to the CJP, asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference to discuss the constitutional tweaks.
In a six-page letter, Justice Shah described the amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges.
“You (CJP) act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance.
Separately, in a seven-page letter, Justice Minhallah said: “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
“A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning.”
He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”.
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, in a letter endorsed by ex-judges, had also asked the CJP to take a stand on the matter.</p><small>2025-11-14 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1413370742552ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955048/renowned-surgeon-dr-shahid-rasul-passes-away-at-59' target='_blank'><strong>Renowned surgeon Dr Shahid Rasul passes away at 59</strong></a><br><p>The Executive Director of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Dr Shahid Rasul, passed away at 59 in Karachi on Friday.
Colleagues and hospital sources confirmed to Dawn that Dr Rasul died of cardiac arrest today.
Dr Rasul was a renowned surgeon who was appointed as the international adviser for Pakistan for the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (RCPS) of Glasgow.
Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed sorrow over the death of Dr Rasul, stating that “he will always be remembered for his services.”
In a statement issued today, the spokesperson for CM Sindh Abdul Rasheed Channa said, “Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the death of Jinnah Hospital Head Professor Shahid Rasul.”
“Dr Shahid was considered one of the best surgeons in the country,” CM Murad was quoted as saying, adding that his “services will always be remembered.”
The chief minister prayed for the departed and offered condolences to his family, as per the statement.
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also expressed condolences on the passing of Dr Rasul, calling it a “great loss”.
In a statement, he said, “Dr Shahid Rasul was a talented, dutiful, and humane surgeons.”
“His services to the health Department and the health sector can never be forgotten, “ he was quoted as saying.
“Dr Shahid Rasul devoted his entire life to serving the medical field, research, and patient care, “ the minister said, stressing that his death was not only a “great loss for his family but for the whole of the health sector and society.”
“We stand with the bereaved family in their hour of grief,” the minister added.
 






Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho also expressed sorrow over his death, saying that she “was deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Professor Dr Shahid Rasul.”
In a statement, Pechuo said, “His contributions to public health, medical education, and patient care have left an imprint that will continue to guide us for years to come.
“He led JPMC with dedication, compassion, and a firm commitment to serving the people not just from Sindh but all over Pakistan, especially those who rely on our public hospitals the most.
The health minister said that Dr Rasul’s death was a loss “felt not only by the medical community, but by everyone whose lives were touched through the institution he strengthened.”
“We honour his service, his leadership, and his unwavering belief in the power of healthcare to uplift communities,” she added, offering “heartfelt” condolences to his family, colleagues and JPMC.
“May they find strength during this difficult time, and may his legacy continue to inspire us as we work to build a healthier, more caring Sindh,” she said.</p><small>2025-11-14 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14172530f1ecfb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955063/ttap-vows-vigorous-protest-for-restoration-of-constitution' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP vows ‘vigorous protest’ for restoration of Constitution</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday vowed to vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution to its original form in the wake of the passage of the contentious 26th and 27th amendments.
President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Thursday, enacting it into law. The TTAP had already ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the am­­end­ment since Sunday and urged the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
While the 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their vote as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) had also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In a post on X today, the TTAP said it was holding an emergency meeting at the residence of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.
In attendance were Qaiser, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and others, including Zain Ali Shah, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Ali Asghar Khan, Hussain Akhwandzada, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Shaukat Basra.
 






The members of the meeting later gathered and chanted slogans against the post-amendment Constitution and dictatorship and in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy.
 






In a press release issued after the meeting, the alliance said: “TTAP reiterates its resistance and struggle against these unconstitutional amendments and will vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution in its original form and demands that the Constitution be restored in its original form.”
 






It said the amendments were against the basic structure of the Constitution and an attack on a fundamental pillar of democracy — the judiciary — that had subordinated the judiciary to the executive and “destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution” while introducing person-specific changes.
The TTAP said its leaders rejected the amendments and demanded that the Constitution be restored to its original form.
“These controversial constitutional amendments have completely destroyed the judiciary and limited the authority and existence of the Supreme Court,” the TTAP said.
It also hailed the resignations of Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah as resistance to the “robbery of the Constitution” and paid tribute to judges who upheld their constitutional oath.
Outlining the moves against the 27th amendment, the TTAP said MNAs and senators would march from the National Assembly to the Supreme Court on Monday, a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th amendment and MPAs would march from the Punjab Assembly to the Lahore High Court on Monday with lawyers participating as well.
The TTAP further announced observing next Friday as a ‘black day’ across the country.
In other announcements, the TTAP said it fully supported the declaration of the KP Peace Jirga and demanded its implementation; demanded the immediate release of Imran, his wife and incarcerated PTI leaders and workers, as well as the leadership and members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee.
The PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee previously suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, also voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Contentious bill
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution took shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that the government had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, the prime minister also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14185206427bec0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955072/pakistan-saudi-arabia-military-leaders-discuss-advancing-mutual-defence-pact' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia military leaders discuss advancing mutual defence pact</strong></a><br><p>Chief of General Staff (CGS) Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met his Saudi counterpart, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al-Rowaily, in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “matters of mutual strategic interest” were discussed during the meeting, including strengthening bilateral defence cooperation, enhancing interoperability and advancing collaboration under the mutual defence agreement.
“Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further deepening the long-standing fraternal ties between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, contributing towards regional peace, stability and self-reliance,” the ISPR said.
The ISPR added that a special meeting of the Pakistan-KSA Bilateral Defence Industrial Forum was also held in Riyadh. Pakistan’s tri-services delegation was led by Lt Gen Raza, while Khalid Al Biyari, Assistant Minister of Defence for Executive Affairs, led the Saudi delegation.
“During the bilateral meet, both sides reviewed the progress of ongoing defence cooperation projects and discussed new avenues for joint ventures in emerging technologies in line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030,” the statement read.
“CGS reaffirmed Pakistan’s continued support for the capacity building of the Royal Saudi Defence Forces,” the ISPR added. “[The] Saudi leadership appreciated Pakistan’s commitments, achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and vital contributions to regional peace and stability.”
In mid-September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.”</p><small>2025-11-14 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14190722b2683cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955050/haris-abrar-shine-as-pakistan-restrict-sri-lanka-to-288-8-in-second-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Haris, Abrar shine as Pakistan restrict Sri Lanka to 288-8 in second ODI</strong></a><br><p>Having starred with the ball in the opener, Haris Rauf was at it again on Friday as Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 288-8 in the second One-day International Cricket at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.
The pacer, who finished with 3-66, responded each time when called upon, especially when Sri Lanka were threatening to post an even bigger total where he picked up two quick wickets to snuff out their hopes.
Haris’ spell at the end came after leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (3-41) had ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order; their exploits giving Pakistan a good chance of wrapping up the series despite a valiant half century by Janith Liyanage and a counter-punching 44 by Kamindu Mendis.
The match, initially scheduled for Thursday, was pushed back to Friday after the terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday, when Pakistan had won the opener at the same venue.
Salman Ali Agha, standing in place of flu-stricken skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi, had opted to bowl after winning the toss and it needed work from fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Mohammad Waseem Jr in the deep to get Pakistan their first breakthrough.
Pathum Nissanka (24) had been looking good, having hit four boundaries, but was run out attempting a risky third run, with his departure bringing to an end a 51-run opening stand.
Fellow opener Kamil Mishara (27) followed soon after; Mohammad Rizwan’s quick glovework helping complete a stumping off Abrar, who sat out the first game due to illness and was returning to the playing XI after a match-winning performance against South Africa last week.
Abrar had been difficult to read for Sri Lankan batters and struck again when Kusal Mendis (20) holed out to Mohammad Nawaz inside the circle on the leg-side.
Abrar was hit for the first boundary of his spell when Sri Lanka skipper Charith Asalanka swept him away but the leg-spinner hit back on the next ball, trapping the left-hander lbw with a ball that spun away after pitching.
Sri Lanka reached 100 in the 23rd over and the first six of their innings came on the first ball of the 24th when Liyanage came down the track and hit Abrar over the long-on fence. Abrar was pulled out of the attack and that gave Sri Lanka the breathing space they needed and Liyanage and Sadeera Sameerawickrama (42) settled soon after.
When the latter got his third boundary with a flick off Nawaz in the 29th, Salman felt Pakistan needed to change tact. Haris was called into action and the pacer, fresh from picking up four wickets in the opening ODI, responded by cleaning up Sameerawickrama, who also hit a six, with a length ball that hit the top of his off-stump and ended a 61-run stand.
The incoming Kamindu launched Haris for a six and with the more sedate Liyanage took Sri Lanka to 200 in the 38th over. Pakistan turned to Abrar once again but Kamindu swatted him away for four as Sri Lanka set themselves up for a late charge.
Spinner Nawaz was plundered for 14 in the 41st over where Liyanage raising his half-century off 56 deliveries and Kamindu getting his second six. But Haris broke the 73-run partnership when he had Kamindu, who hit four fours during his 38-ball stay, caught at the square leg fence.
Liyanage fell in the next over, hitting Waseem to Nawaz at midwicket before Haris trapped Dushmantha Chameera lbw. Wanindu Hasaranga’s unbeaten 37 in the end ensured Sri Lanka set Pakistan 289 to win.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/142000002619b0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955065/president-zardari-accepts-resignations-of-sc-judges-mansoor-ali-shah-and-athar-minallah' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari accepts resignations of SC judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari has accepted the resignations of Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, a post on the President’s official X account said on Friday.
 






The two judges had handed in their resignations yesterday, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by the president, describing the legislation as an affront to the judiciary and the 1973 Cons­titution.
 
 

“I therefore resign as the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in full awareness of the reasons that compel it and in loyalty to the Constitution that has guided every step of my judicial life,” Justice Shah wrote in his 13-page resignation letter, issued in both English and Urdu. The letters were addressed to the president.
Justice Shah had described the amendment as a “grave assault on the Constitution” and said the 27th Amendment dismantled the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugated the judiciary to executive control and struck at the “very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
 
 

The amendment, he said, made justice “more distant, more fragile and more vulnerable to power”.
Justice Minallah, in his resignation letter, had regretted that the Constitution he had sworn to uphold and defend was “no more”.
“Much as I have tried to convince myself otherwise, I can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave,” he bemoaned.
Both judges had recently written to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting a full court meeting to consider the amendment.
 
 

There was no discussion on the 27th Amendment in today’s full court meeting called by CJP Afridi, according to a Supreme Court (SC) press release, which also said that the meeting gave its final approval to the SC Rules, 2025.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif criticised the two Supreme Court judges today for tendering their resignations, saying their “consciences only awakened after their monopoly was curtailed”.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1418154122e9577.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955069/indias-modi-celebrates-as-party-set-for-big-win-in-bihar-state-vote' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi celebrates as party set for big win in Bihar state vote</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed a “resounding” victory for his party and its allies in a key local election in the country’s poorest state of Bihar.
The eastern state of 130 million people was widely seen as a bellwether and a test of Modi’s ability to translate New Delhi’s booming economy into gains for its poorest citizens.
Counting is still ongoing and the final tally may not be out until Saturday, but the election commission said partial results and projections suggested a solid majority for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies in the state assembly.
Modi called the win a “victory of good governance”.
“This resounding public mandate will empower us to serve the people and work with new resolve for Bihar,” he said in a post on social media.
 






Bihar is the only state in the Hindi-speaking north where Modi’s party has never ruled alone.
This time too, it is unlikely to secure a majority by itself but appears set to emerge as the single largest party ahead of its alliance partner, Janata Dal (United).
Together with smaller allies, they are on course to secure at least three-quarters of
the state legislature’s 243 seats, according to figures from the election commission.
The election outcome can boost Modi and his party ahead of other key regional polls next year, analysts say.
It is also expected to put the Indian leader on a surer footing after a series of daunting economic and foreign policy challenges, including armed conflict with neighbouring Pakistan and steep US tariffs.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14175155085649c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955066/jordans-king-abdullah-ii-to-arrive-in-pakistan-for-two-day-state-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Jordan’s King Abdullah II to arrive in Pakistan for two-day state visit</strong></a><br><p>Jordan’s King Abdullah II will arrive in Pakistan for a two-day state visit on Saturday at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during which he is expected to hold high-level meetings with the prime minister and the president, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.
The Jordanian monarch’s last visit to Pakistan was at the invitation of former president Mamnoon Hussain. Two memoranda of understanding were signed by both nations, with one related to cooperation in civil protection and defence and the other to cooperation in the housing sector.
According to the FO, Saturday’s high-level visit reflects the “longstanding, fraternal relations” between Islamabad and Amman.
“It will serve to further strengthen the strategic direction of Pakistan–Jordan relations and place them on a higher trajectory, encompassing a comprehensive and broad-based partnership in the political, economic, and cultural spheres,” the statement read.
 






“During his visit … King Abdullah II … will hold important meetings with the president and the prime minister of Pakistan,” the statement added. “The full range of bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries will be discussed.”
The FO further said that a special investiture ceremony to confer the highest civilian award upon the king will also take place at the Presidency.
“The visit of … King Abdullah II … will further consolidate the longstanding Pakistan–Jordan relationship and contribute to expanding the scope and spectrum of bilateral cooperation between the two brotherly countries,” the statement concluded.
In late October, King Abdullah II lauded the Pakistani military’s contributions to regional peace and security in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, according to the military’s media wing.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief was on an official visit to Jordan and called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.
“His majesty appreciated the professionalism and contributions of the Pakistan Armed Forces towards regional peace and stability and expressed his desire to further strengthen defence collaboration between the two brotherly countries,” the ISPR said, adding that the army chief conveyed warm regards from Pakistan’s people, government and military.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14144721fba3782.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955057/pakistan-will-not-hold-talks-with-any-terrorist-group-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not hold talks with any terrorist group: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi asserted on Friday that Pakistan had never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul but would not hold talks with any terrorist groups.
The spokesperson’s speech came in the context of the third round of talks that concluded on November 7 in Istanbul between Pakistan and Afghanistan, aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and consolidating a fragile ceasefire that was initially agreed upon after border clashes last month.
Since the skirmishes, representatives of the two countries held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement could not be achieved. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that a ceasefire, however, was still in place “for the time being”.
“Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul. However, Pakistan will not hold dialogue with any terrorist groups, be it Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA),” he said while addressing his weekly press briefing.
“The third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime concluded on November 7 in Istanbul,” he said, expressing appreciation for the “sincere efforts” of mediating countries Qatar and Turkiye.
“Since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil on Pakistan. Throughout these years, Pakistan — despite suffering military and civilian casualties — exercised maximum restraint and did not escalate,” he said.
He added that Pakistan expected that with the passage of time, the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the banned TTP.
He said that during this time, Pakistan also tried to positively engage with the Afghan Taliban regime, offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan, the response from the Taliban regimes has only been hollow promises and inaction,” he regretted.
He said that the TTP and the BLA were declared enemies of Pakistan.
“Anyone harbouring, abetting or financing them is not considered a friend and a well-wisher of Pakistan and its people,” he said.
“Pakistan is determined to take every possible action to safeguard its security and the security of its people. We regret that the Taliban regime is constantly trying to misrepresent the issue of terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“Taliban regime is also trying to portray TTP and BLA as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee crisis but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees,” he said.
“Pakistan is ready to receive any Pakistani living in Afghanistan … provided they are handed over at the border crossing … and not hurled across the border fully equipped with sophisticated weapons and equipment,” he said.
The FO spokesperson also stated that some elements in the Afghan Taliban did not want confrontation with Pakistan, but there was a “strong lobby” with monetary support from foreign actors that had been tasked to “stoke tension”.
“These elements have been engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan, and in doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had,” he said.
“Some elements in the Taliban regime are also trying to propagate that there is some disagreement within Pakistan over its Afghan policy. This is misleading. There is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that ordinary people are the biggest victims of terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan,” he said.
“The armed forces of Pakistan are making sacrifices to safeguard the lives and properties of the people of Pakistan. Therefore, the entire nation stands with its armed forces to safeguard the interests of Pakistan and the lives of the people,” he said.
Andrabi also said that some elements within the Afghan Taliban regime were “trying to instigate Pashtun nationalism in Pakistan.”
“It is a historical fact that Pashtuns in Pakistan are a vibrant part of society and state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of public life and civil society. More Pashtuns live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan; therefore, instead of instigating Pashtunism in Pakistan, it would be wise for the Taliban regime to look into its own credentials,” he said.
The FO spokesperson added that with the “evidence-based and well-documented sharp rise in terrorism emanating from Afghanistan into Pakistan after August 2021, the Taliban regime can neither deny the reality nor absolve itself of its responsibility”.
“While the Afghan Taliban declare terrorism and Pakistan an internal issue, they fail to mention that there are people within Afghanistan who have issued fatwas, legitimising terrorist attacks against Pakistan. Moreover, terrorist groups operating inside Pakistan now comprise a large no. of Afghan nationals.
He said that Pakistan remained committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue; however, Pakistan’s core concerns, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needed to be addressed “first and foremost.”</p><small>2025-11-14 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1410004555d3f5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955036/us-announces-new-military-operation-in-latin-america' target='_blank'><strong>US announces new military operation in Latin America</strong></a><br><p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Thursday a military operation to “remove narco-terrorists,” amid growing concerns that a US naval build-up in Latin American waters could presage land strikes and a wider conflict.
“Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth posted on social media platform X.
“This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” he said.
 






The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken.
President Donald Trump’s administration is conducting a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, deploying naval and air forces for what it calls an anti-drugs offensive.
US forces have carried out strikes on about 20 vessels in international waters in the region since early September, killing at least 76 people, according to US figures.
Asked for clarification on the precise nature of Operation Southern Spear, a Pentagon spokesperson simply referred inquiries back to Hegseth’s post on X.
CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land.
Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise.
New US strike on alleged drug boat kills four in Caribbean
US forces have struck another alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, upping the death toll in the contentious anti-narcotics campaign to 80, US media reports said on Thursday.
This week’s reported strike took the toll to 80 deaths in 20 strikes in international waters.
 


The timing of the strike was not clear, with broadcaster CBS reporting the boat was destroyed on Monday and The New York Times reporting the strike took place on Wednesday, both citing an unnamed Pentagon official.
The Pentagon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-11-14 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14161201a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955060/phc-bars-kp-govt-from-employing-official-vehicles-for-personal-or-political-use' target='_blank'><strong>PHC bars KP govt from employing official vehicles for ‘personal or political use’</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday imposed a ban on the use of government resources, such as vehicles, by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for personal or political use.
According to a court order available with Dawn, the provincial administration was banned from using official vehicles without authorisation, stating that it amounted to “misconduct and abuse of authority”.
“This court is of the view that the use of official vehicles, machinery, or any other government resources for participation in, or facilitation of, political gatherings, protest rallies, or long marches constitutes a blatant misuse of public property and authority,” the PHC ruled.
The order added that this practice was not only violating public trust but also undermining the concept of neutral governance.
“Public resources, including official vehicles and heavy machinery, are procured and maintained from the public exchequer for the sole purpose of performing official duties and providing services to the citizens in accordance with law,” the order read.
“Their diversion for political or extraneous purposes, whether directly or indirectly, undermines the sanctity of the public office and shakes public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the administration,” it added, further stating that nobody holding public office can employ government resources for partisan or personal use.
The PHC ruled that Articles 4 (right of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with law), 5 (loyalty to state and obedience to Constitution and law) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution imply that public resources cannot be used by any one party or individual  “to the disadvantage of others”.
“In a democratic system governed by the rule of law, the state must maintain strict separation between official functions and political activities,” the order read. “The use of government vehicles or personnel in political events conveys an impression of state endorsement or complicity in partisan matters, which is impermissible.”
The PHC ordered the KP government to ensure that “no official vehicle, machinery, or manpower under their control is deployed, used, or permitted to be used for any protest, long march, rally, or political activity of any nature”.
Last November, a petition was filed against the KP government, led by then-chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, against the use of government vehicles like fire engines during the PTI’s long march to Islamabad.
The petition stated that the provincial government had used government resources such as fire engines and heavy machinery from the local government department that government officials had been mobilised to join their march.
During the march, protesters gathered at D-Chowk to demand PTI founder Imran Khan’s release, among other things, amid reports of intense tear gas shelling by security forces to curtail the large crowds. Clashes between party supporters and police ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.

More responds with a powerful image: England is planted thick with laws, “like a forest”, and those laws protect everyone, even the people we despise.
Then More asks a piercing question: if you cut down every law to hunt your enemies, what will protect you when power turns and comes for you? Without the law, More warns, you will be standing in an open field with the winds blowing from every direction, completely defenceless.
This scene captures the core of the play: the rule of law is not a tool for the powerful but a shield for everyone, and once it is weakened for expedience, no one can control what comes next.
Yesterday, Pakistan lost two of its most brilliant jurists — Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah. Why that happened remains for history to answer. But their story did not begin yesterday. It began decades ago, in 1997, when three friends, united by a shared belief in the Constitution, established one of the most progressive law firms of the time: Afridi, Shah & Minallah. They had little more than their intellect, their conviction, and an unshakable refusal to compromise principle for power.
A decade later, that promise was tested. They stood by their principles, boycotting the Dogar court and taking to the streets as part of the nationwide lawyers’ movement to reinstate Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Their courage was quiet, steadfast, and unwavering. The Dogar court fell. The Chaudhry court resumed. What happened within those walls is a discussion for another day.
Justice Shah: a bench of reform
Justice Shah was elevated to the Lahore High Court in 2009, following a distinguished legal career spanning tax, corporate, and numerous public interest cases, particularly in environmental protection and sustainable development. Elevation had never been on his radar, but a few persuaded him that the bench would give him a platform to interpret the law, expand rights, transform social order, and uphold the rule of law.
And he did all that, and more.
At the Lahore High Court, Justice Shah authored some of the most progressive judgments across elections, democracy, disability, gender, climate, technology, court delays, local government, and more. Known as the “green judge”, he led the Green Bench to hear climate and environmental disputes.
 
 

A judicial reformist, he established Alternate Dispute Resolution Centres in Punjab to reduce chronic case backlogs, set up Criminal and Civil Model Courts to improve coordination and expedite justice, and introduced the Case Management and Court Automation Systems.
With the Punjab Information Technology Board, he implemented the first Enterprise IT System to make the judicial system open, transparent, and fully connected for the decade ahead.
Justice Minallah: courage in the capital
In 2014, Shah was joined by his friend and former law firm partner, Athar Minallah, who rose to the bench at the Islamabad High Court, where a clear strand of judicial courage emerged.
Justice Minallah confronted enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, illegal land acquisitions, animal rights violations, and defended society’s most vulnerable. When the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 was weaponised to stifle dissent, he declared it unconstitutional.
He also made exemplary judicial appointments, including several judges who repeatedly stood firm to principle despite intense executive pressure.
 
 

The purpose of this piece is not to catalogue every judicial achievement. Even their critics must acknowledge the creativity, constitutional insight, and hundreds of judgments they authored, which enriched Pakistan’s jurisprudence domestically and internationally. They carried this par excellence with grace and grit at the Supreme Court, and their impact continues to resonate.
One may disagree with many of their lordships’ judgments, but like everyone else, they are human.
As Justice Minallah recently reminded in a letter, “Barring a few exceptions, all of us, myself included, have erred or fallen short of the ideals we are sworn to uphold. We are, after all, fallible human beings.”
The Qazi court
Much of what we have witnessed over the past two years is the story of how one judicial era and its successor inflicted extraordinary damage on the Constitution. The Qazi court set the stage. Whatever remained intact after that was not undone; it was taken to an entirely new level by the court that followed, a level defined by autocratic legalism.
During this period, Pakistan’s largest political party, the PTI, was stripped of its electoral symbol on the eve of the 2024 general elections. The court declined to clarify PTI’s legal status, forcing its candidates to contest as independents. When the majority of those independents managed to clinch victory despite the several hurdles placed in their way, their democratic mandate was quietly denied. When PTI-backed independents joined another entity to claim reserved seats, the Election Commission of Pakistan denied them their constitutional entitlement. The Peshawar High Court upheld this denial.
The matter then reached the Supreme Court, where a three-member bench led by Justice Shah, and joined by Justice Minallah, granted leave, suspended the PHC judgment, and directed the formation of a larger bench. By an 8–5 majority, the full court, in an opinion authored by Justice Shah and joined by Justice Minallah, held what had been obvious: “PTI was and is a political party.”
 
 

The judgment reaffirmed a fundamental principle of electoral democracy: “When the Election Commission errs or makes significant mistakes impacting the electoral process, judicial intervention becomes necessary to rectify them and ensure electoral justice. The judiciary, tasked with ensuring electoral justice, must foremost preserve the will of the people.”
Even this was not enough. The principle of the “Master of the Roster”, which Justice Isa himself had previously critiqued, was restored, now manipulated to serve his own whims. The Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Committee was reshuffled to engineer bench composition. Judges were handpicked, verdicts overturned, and the path cleared for the 26th Amendment, designed to prevent a single individual from ever becoming chief justice. History will not forget this episode: it is truly one for the books.
Yet the will of the people was never delivered. Not then, not later, not to this day. The same court, aided by two dissents, opened the door for the Election Commission to ignore the verdict.
So, where did the Qazi court lead us?
A Constitution left adrift, civil freedoms suspended, executive capture entrenched, and judicial independence in tatters. On his last day in office, both Justice Shah and Justice Minallah refused to attend the chief justice’s reference.
Justice Shah described him as “an ostrich with its head in the sand, complacent and indifferent to external influences and pressures on the judiciary”. Even when courageous judges confronted interference in their work, the chief justice publicly insisted there was “no external influence in the judiciary”.
Justice for those judges was not served, and it is still not served.
The loyal court and the path to the 27th Amendment
The Qazi court had already undermined the very foundation of the Constitution. Its successor, with a handpicked chief justice, completed that destruction. Military courts were legalised, verdicts restoring the will of the people were overturned, and challenges to the 26th Amendment were ignored.
In the reserved seats verdict, Justice Shah reminded us, “We must remember that Constitutions are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing situations but are designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.”
Today, Parliament has bulldozed through a constitutional amendment that fundamentally alters the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. The amendment establishes a Federal Constitutional Court, effectively a Federally Controlled Court (FCC), a parallel judicial structure that strips the Supreme Court of Pakistan of its defining role: interpreting the Constitution.
Under this amendment, the president and prime minister appoint the FCC’s chief justice and initial judges, bypassing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and embedding executive influence from the outset. Until legislation determines its composition, the executive alone decides the number of judges. Their preferred nominee has already been identified: the same judge who instructed the election commission to disregard a binding Supreme Court decision.
Almost every civil or criminal case involves a constitutional question, yet litigants must now navigate a maze between the FCC and the Supreme Court. Cases will ricochet; justice will become slower, costlier, and less certain; ordinary citizens seeking refuge from power will have no clear path.
 
 

History is rarely kind to regimes that attempt permanence through constitutional engineering. Their projects always collapse, but only after inflicting deep wounds on institutions meant to protect citizens. Pakistan has seen this cycle before.
In his additional note in the Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Reference, Justice Yahya Afridi warned that “the extraordinary political climate of the time and the pressures inherent in such an environment appear to have influenced the course of justice in a manner inconsistent with the ideals of judicial independence”. He paid tribute to Justices Dorab Patel, Muhammad Haleem, and G. Safdar Shah, judges who stood firm in moments of darkness, even when their dissents could not change the outcome.
But when history presented him with the same test, the chief justice appears to have chosen accommodation over conviction. The 27th Amendment was bulldozed through, and he did not resist the dismantling of the judiciary. What he diagnosed in words, he failed to defend in practice. In the end, others saw him as more concerned with retaining his title than safeguarding the institution — serving as chief justice of a broken, toothless Supreme Court stripped of its constitutional soul.
Reckoning and responsibility
The damage will haunt the country for years. Like all assaults on constitutionalism, this too will eventually be undone, but we cannot leave that reckoning to time. The moment demands clarity, courage, and memory.
The judges who take oath in an illegitimate, federally controlled court will be nothing but collaborators; those who accepted extensions and titles in exchange for conscience have betrayed the very principles they swore to uphold. Now is the time to act. This responsibility is not limited to them; it extends to each of us who believes in the supremacy of the Constitution, and in courage and judicial independence.
Eighteen years after the lawyers’ movement, when three friends and colleagues, bound by a shared belief in the Constitution, were tested once more, only two remained true to that promise. Shah and Minallah still stood firm, courageous, and unbowed.
And so the story returns to where it began: the law, when defended with intellect, conviction, and courage, remains the forest in which justice grows, shielding all, even those we may despise, from the unpredictable winds of power.
Thank you, Shah and Minallah. History will neither forget nor forgive.</p><small>2025-11-14 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14134249626891e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955004/justice-aminuddin-khan-sworn-in-as-first-chief-justice-of-federal-constitutional-court' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Aminuddin Khan sworn in as first chief justice of Federal Constitutional Court</strong></a><br><p>Justice Aminuddin Khan on Friday was sworn in as the first chief justice of the newly established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) after the 27th Amendment was enacted into law a day earlier.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his sister Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani, and members of the federal cabinet were also in attendance.
The ceremony began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, following which President Zardari administered the oath to Justice Aminuddin in English.
In his oath, Justice Aminuddin vowed to discharge his duties in accordance with the Constitution and the law, while also abiding by the code of conduct issued by the Supreme Judicial Council.
“That I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions. That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and that in all circumstances, I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will,” he said in his oath, after which he shook hands with the president.
His appointment was made by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier under Clause 3 of Article 175A, read with Article 175C, of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date of Justice Aminuddin’s oath-taking.
The proposal to establish the FCC has been revived as part of the judicial reforms incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. According to government officials, the FCC’s creation aims to reduce the SC’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases and strengthen judicial independence and credibility.
6 judges appointed to FCC
President Zardari also appointed the remaining six judges to the FCC. A notification issued by the law ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the president made the appointments under Clause 3 of Article 175-A read with Article 175-C of the Constitution.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Supreme Court, Justice KK Agha of the Sindh High Court and Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech were appointed to the FCC.
Justice (retd) Arshad Hussain Shah has also been appointed. He was appointed as Justice Musarrat Hilali was not willing to join the FCC, a source told Dawn.
The initial strength of the FCC was determined through a presidential order, while any fu­­ture increase in the number of judges will require parliamentary approval through an act of Parliament.
Of the judges appointed to the FCC, Justices Rizvi, Farooq and Najafi were administered the oath by Justice Aminuddin at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today.
It was earlier reported that the oath-taking ceremony for the FCC judges would be held at the IHC, as judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) had resisted an immediate relocation to the third floor of the IHC building.
Initially, the oath-taking of Justice Aminud­din was scheduled for Thursday at 10am. However, following a minor revision to the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, the legislation had to be returned to the Senate for approval. After the Senate cleared the bill on Thursday, the ceremony was first rescheduled for 6pm and was later moved to Friday morning.
Interestingly, that ceremony was also not held in the FSC as originally planned. The FCC was intended to be established in the FSC building in Islamabad, while the FSC was to be shifted to the IHC premises. However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges expressed dissatisfaction over their abrupt relocation and raised the matter with CJP Afridi.</p><small>2025-11-14 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/141357476dcba50.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955049/khawaja-asif-assails-sc-judges-for-stepping-down-says-conscience-awakened-only-after-monopoly-curtailed' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif assails SC judges for stepping down, says ‘conscience awakened only after monopoly curtailed’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday criticised two Supreme Court judges for tendering resignations following the passage of the 27th constitutional amendment a day earlier, saying their “consciences only awakened after their monopoly was curtailed.”
Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, Asif accused the judges of having “selective amnesia”, saying that they had “forgotten their past” and were now becoming “guardians of democracy”.
“Four to five years ago — in fact, eight to 10 years ago — when the process to remove Nawaz Sharif from his post started, I want to tell you about the history of our SC judges at that time. The conspiracy created against Nawaz before that and the role our judiciary played in turning that conspiracy into reality,” Asif said, amid chants of ‘kon bachayega Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan’ [who will save Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan] by the opposition.
“The entire process started with the Panama case when Chief Justice Saqib Nisar formed two benches that deemed Nawaz ineligible to hold office,” Asif said, adding that the bench included Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Ejaz Afzal, Gulzar Ahmed, and Ijazul Ahsan.
“After Nawaz was declared ineligible, another bench was created to decide the duration of the ineligibility,” the defence minister said.
He highlighted that under the supervision of Justice Nisar, a bench comprising Justices Umar Ata Bandial, Ijazul Ahsan, and Sajjad Ali Shah, decided that ineligibility will be life-long.
“Then another bench was formed, also supervised by Justice Nisar, which declared that no ineligible person can become the leader of a political party,” Asif added. He said in almost every political lawsuit, the same few judges were witnessed thereafter.
“When these kangaroo courts were being formed, Nawaz was being victimised, and an agenda was being implemented that he would not remain a leader and would be expelled from politics forever; at that time, no one felt any shame,” the minister said, referring to the resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah following the passage of the 27th Amendment by the parliament.
“These judges from yesterday were serving in SC and high courts back then; now they’re writing poetry and issuing political statements,” referring to a poem Justice Shah added to his resignation letter.
According to Asif, the judges’ “conscience awakened because their monopoly in SC was curtailed.”
The minister added that the amendment in question sought to establish the superiority of the Constitution.
Referring to the opposition, he said that they chant ‘Khan nahi tou Pakistan nahi’ [if there is no Khan, there is no Pakistan], which was proof that they don’t stand with the Constitution of Pakistan but instead with a single person.
“These people have become protectors of terrorists; people who come from across the border and do murder and destruction here,” Asif said, assailing the opposition for not condemning the attacks in Wana and Islamabad.
Resignation letters
In his letter to the president yesterday, Justice Shah had assailed the 27th Amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
“By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote.
“As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed — but not before leaving deep institutional scars.”
The judge had stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation.
On the other hand, Justice Minallah had stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order.
“I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added.
Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”.
“What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote.
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation had come hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had said 64 votes were cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate yesterday to consider the latest changes.
The 27th Amendment promised, on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.
At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters</p><small>2025-11-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1412243913983fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955041/govt-says-4-ttp-terrorists-arrested-for-involvement-in-islamabad-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says 4 TTP terrorists arrested for involvement in Islamabad suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were arrested for their involvement in the suicide blast in Islamabad earlier this week, the government said on Friday.
“In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
 






The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies.
The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad.
On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added.
“The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij/TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said.
“Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added.
At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”.
The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14130304477fa06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955044/following-na-approval-senate-also-passes-bill-for-resetting-coas-munirs-tenure-after-appointment-as-cdf' target='_blank'><strong>Following NA approval, Senate also passes bill for resetting COAS Munir’s tenure after appointment as CDF</strong></a><br><p>The Senate swiftly passed four bills related to the recently approved contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Friday, including one that seeks changes to the Army Act and resets the tenure of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir after his appointment as the chief of the defence forces (CDF).
As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) yesterday, this means that the five-year tenure of the chief of the defence forces would commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
The four bills were passed by the Senate today — a day after their hurried passage in the National Assembly — without debate and with little resistance from the opposition.
Apart from the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025, the bills also included the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025, the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025, and the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif until he joined the session.
Asif presented the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025 when he arrived in the house. After him, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Law Minister Tarar.
As Dar began presenting the bills, he explained that the bill sought changes to the relevant laws in line with the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday.
The passage of the Amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the Amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
But, little resistance by the opposition to the passage of the four bills in the Senate was witnessed today.
What are the changes?
The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill seeks to replace the expression “chief of the army staff” with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, it suggests replacing the “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Another important amendment to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952 says that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another amendment regarding the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.”
The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the chief of the defence forces.
It further says that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Another amendment reads that “the federal government may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces and by order in writing, authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, amendments to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
The amendment to the Supreme Court law paves the way for the elimination of the Constitutional Bench, which was formed under the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1411350117098db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955039/fresh-us-draft-on-gaza-mentions-path-to-palestinian-statehood-while-russia-submits-counter-proposal' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh US draft on Gaza mentions path to Palestinian statehood while Russia submits counter proposal</strong></a><br><p>The United States circulated a second revision of its draft resolution on Gaza at the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Thursday, even as Russia countered with its own text calling for the preservation of the current ceasefire and a renewed commitment to a two-state solution.
Senior UN diplomats told Dawn that Washington placed “Revision 2” of its draft under a silence procedure until 6:30pm New York time on November 13, a step intended to indicate that the negotiation phase was nearly complete. Under this procedure, the absence of objections signifies consent.
“But China and Russia broke the silence,” one diplomat said, noting that both delegations submitted formal objections shortly before the deadline. “Once silence is broken, other member states may also submit comments — and some did — although Pakistan did not,“ the diplomat added.
Following the break, Russia swiftly distributed its own draft resolution to UNSC members.
Breaking silence means, the US may now be forced to resume negotiations. Washington may still put its draft “in blue”, the final pre-vote format, but doing so without addressing the concerns of permanent members would almost certainly trigger a veto.
Diplomats said another negotiation round is now expected before any vote is scheduled.
The latest US revision builds on Trump’s broader post-conflict Gaza plan, which includes the creation of a foreign-administered “Board of Peace” to manage Gaza during a transitional period. The plan also proposes the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to disarm armed groups and secure the territory.
The plan places Gaza under a multilateral but foreign-led body while Palestinian institutions undergo reforms. Several countries have expressed reservations about this model, prompting Washington to refine the language in its second revision.
One of the most significant additions in the revised draft is the explicit call to maintain the Gaza ceasefire, a concession made after weeks of discussions with Arab, Muslim and European delegations.
The US also expanded the section on Palestinian statehood. The new language in Operative Paragraph 2 (OP2) states: “After the Palestinian Authority reform programme is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”
The paragraph then commits Washington to political engagement, saying: “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”
This wording aims to reassure delegates that Palestinian statehood will not be indefinitely delayed, but will depend on concrete progress in governance and reconstruction.
Another change specifically clarifies that the Board of Peace’s authority is strictly “transitional”, addressing concerns from several UNSC members that the board might evolve into a long-term trusteeship.
Crucially, diplomats noted that the revised draft also specifies the conditions for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The revised language states that Israel will withdraw “as the ISF establishes control and stability”.
By linking withdrawal to ISF deployment and consolidation, the US draft outlines a phased exit rather than an immediate pullout, something that has drawn objections from Moscow and Beijing.
Russia’s counter-resolution
In response to the US initiative, Russia circulated its own draft resolution on Thursday evening. Moscow’s proposal centres on preserving the ceasefire, guaranteeing humanitarian access, and reaffirming the two-state solution without introducing foreign transitional authorities or an externally imposed governance structure.
The Russian draft cites the UN Charter and recalls “all its relevant resolutions on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, as well as a UN General Assembly resolution on the peaceful settlement of the conflict.
It “welcomes the initiative that led to the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, referring to the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict of September 29, and calls on all parties — with UN facilitation — to determine practical steps to implement it.
The resolution also “stresses the need to maintain the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that should lead to a comprehensive and permanent cessation of hostilities”, urging all sides to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law.
On humanitarian issues, Moscow’s draft “demands full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access” for UN agencies and partners, both to expand relief operations and to support reconstruction.
The Russian text also takes a firm position against changes to Gaza’s geography, saying: “The Security Council rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of the Gaza Strip.”
On the political framework, the resolution “reiterates its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”, and stresses the importance of “the unity and the territorial contiguity of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”.
It concludes with the standard clause that the UNSC “decides to remain actively seized of the matter”.
With silence broken on the US draft, Washington is now preparing for another round of consultations. Senior diplomats say the two competing drafts reflect “a deeper divide over who should shape Gaza’s post-war administration — and on what timeline Palestinian statehood should become actionable”.
Both texts emphasise the ceasefire and humanitarian access, but differ sharply on governance, security arrangements, and the nature of international involvement. The US plan proposes transitional foreign supervision and conditional political progress, while the Russian draft anchors itself in existing UN frameworks and rejects foreign administrative bodies.
Diplomats in New York expect “intense, possibly prolonged” negotiations before the Security Council takes action on either draft.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69167a93ec759.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954920/focus-back-on-cricket-as-pakistan-eye-series-triumph-over-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Focus back on cricket as Pakistan eye series triumph over Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: After a day and a night of chaos, focus will finally shift back to cricket when Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the second One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday.
The encounter — Pakistan’s opportunity to wrap up their second successive ODI series — comes after a turbulent 48 hours that threatened to overshadow the cricket itself. The match was originally slated for Thursday, but the schedule was thrown into disarray after a terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday sparked understandable concern within the Sri Lankan camp.
Reports soon emerged that several visiting players were contemplating abandoning the tour altogether. The uncertainty prompted urgent intervention from Pakistan’s interior minister and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who, along with the country’s top security officials, held lengthy discussions with the Sri Lankan delegation to assure them of their safety.
By late Wednesday night, the situation had stabilised. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) reaffirmed its commitment to completing the series, a gesture that was met with appreciation across Pakistan.
“Thank you Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan cricket board,” Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi said in a video released by the PCB. “You have supported us in difficult times. We are grateful.”
 






Speculation that a few Sri Lankan players would fly home and be replaced by fresh faces was swiftly denied by the team’s manager, who confirmed there would be no changes to the touring party. That assurance means the visitors will field a full-strength line-up in Rawalpindi as they attempt to level the three-match series following a narrow defeat in the opener.
In the first ODI, Pakistan’s six-run victory owed much to a remarkable century by Salman Ali Agha and a fiery spell of fast bowling from Haris Rauf. The two combined to restrict Sri Lankan dominance at crucial junctures before the match went Pakistan’s way.
Salman, coming in with his side struggling at 76-3, stitched together a crucial 138-run partnership with Hussain Talat to lift Pakistan to a defendable total. Haris then ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order with four wickets, halting their chase just when it appeared they were cruising.
Shaheen’s men, however, will be aware that they cannot rely on individual brilliance alone. Their top order faltered once again, scoring just 76 in the first 20 overs, a familiar pattern that has left Pakistan’s middle order under constant pressure in recent months. The bowling, too, lacked discipline early on, as Sri Lanka raced to 85 in 12 overs before Haris’ intervention.
Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka, meanwhile, will take heart from his side’s aggressive start in the first match but lamented the lack of composure during key phases. The visitors also found themselves on the wrong side of fortune, having burned both their reviews early before one tight lbw shout against Hussain that replays later suggested could have gone either way.
“It was phenomenal, the way our bowlers started,” Asalanka said afterwards. “But one decision went against us, and that was unlucky. We couldn’t capitalise after that.”
With the series on the line, both teams will look to regroup mentally after the off-field turbulence. Pakistan will want to build on their momentum and seal the contest, while Sri Lanka will hope to draw inspiration from their composure in adversity.

Over the January-October period, Pakistan’s edible oil imports stood at 3.07m tonnes, surpassing the 3m tonnes imported in 2024.
“This is a huge increase going on … and this is primarily because of the surge in the population growth and also certain economic development,” Jan Mohammed told an industry conference on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali.
 
 

The country imported around 2.9m tonnes to 3m tonnes per year from 2022 to 2024. Over the January-October period, it imported 2.2m tonnes of oilseeds.
During a recent consultative meeting on edible oil regularisation, it was highlighted that approximately 30 per cent of edible oil consumed in Pakistan annually — more than 4.5m tonnes — comprises unbranded, loose oil, primarily found in semi-urban and rural areas.
Experts said that the loose oil, typically sold in bulk without proper packaging or labelling, often contains harmful chemicals, impurities, and biological contaminants.

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz made these remarks while hearing separate cases on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively.
During the hearing of a case related to a private company before Justice Kayani on Thursday, a lawyer requested that the final arguments be scheduled for the first week of December.
However, Justice Kayani responded: “In the first week of December, another judge will be sitting here to hear this case.”
The lawyer expressed his concern, saying, “Sir, don’t say things like this that make us uncomfortable.”
Justice Kayani replied with a smile, “No problem. I am happy about it.”
When the lawyer said, “Sir, you will leave… we have a lot to learn from you”, Justice Kayani reiterated, “No problem, I am happy.”
A day earlier, Justice Imtiaz had made similar remarks during the hearing of another case, saying that her bench might not be available from December, when a counsel sought an adjournment for the following week.
 
 

It may be recalled that five IHC judges, including Justi­ces Kayani and Imtiaz, had strongly challenged the tra­n­s­fer of incumbent Chief Jus­ti­­ce Sardar Mohammad Sarf­raz Dogar to the Islamabad High Court earlier this year.
The recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary.
According to sources, the transfers of high court judges are exp­ected to take place in phases, with the IHC likely to be affected first.

The latest meeting, held at the company’s head office in Karachi on Thursday, was convened with the same agenda put forward earlier this month, i.e. the removal of CEO Moonis Alvi.
However, the effort faltered as the meeting witnessed serious differences among the government board members and those from the private sector. A majority of board members walked out, effectively blocking the motion.
 
 

Company sources told Dawn that, unlike the previous meeting on Nov 5, Thursday’s session met all legal requirements and began with a quorum. Nine of the 10 directors were present, though the federal finance secretary was unable to attend. Proceedings were recorded in line with the procedure.

Motion blocked as majority of board members leave six-minute meeting

However, the meeting lasted only six minutes. As the agenda centred on the CEO’s removal, Mr Alvi did not attend.
After the meeting opened, five directors — Adeeb Ahmad, Mubasher H. Sheikh, Muhammad Kamran Kamal, Saad Amanullah Khan and Shan A. Ashary — excused themselves and left the venue.
This left only the two government nominees — the Secretary of Power and director Javed Kureishi, who had called the meeting — in the room. Board Chairman Mark Gerard Skelton also remained on the premises.
The walkout rendered the meeting unworkable and the attempt to unseat the CEO collapsed for a second time.
Later, K-Electric forwarded its report to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) titled ‘Board Meeting Other Than Financial Results’.
“In continuation of our intimation dated Nov 7, this is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on Thursday, 13 November 2025, considered matters other than the financial results of the Company. Please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” the company’s statement said.

• Achakzai wants  demos on Fridays
• KP CM stopped from meeting Imran for sixth time
ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the resignations of the judges of the top court and urging the judiciary to stand on its feet, the PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee has suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference.
 






The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly.
Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
“The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said.
Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart.
 
 

“[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.”
Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government.
“We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued.
He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition.
KP CM denied meeting again
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday.
Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises.
Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired.
The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented.
It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder.
Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief.
“Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked.
He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics.
