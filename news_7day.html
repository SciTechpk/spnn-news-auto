An official statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday noted that the reduced tariff will create new opportunities for Pakistani exporters to expand their footprint in the US. The development was discussed during a high-level meeting on US reciprocal tariffs, chaired by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.
The meeting was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul, senior officials from the Commerce and Industries Divisions, and more than 30 leading exporters and SMEs from key sectors including apparel, textiles, rice, salt, surgical instruments, sports goods, electronics, food and agriculture, and leather.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.

Islamabad secures the lowest tariffs among regional competitors

Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar highlighted Pakistan’s comparative advantage in the region and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting industry stakeholders in unlocking business potential under evolving global conditions.
 
 

Industry representatives called for consistent and industry-friendly policies to optimise manufacturing costs and secure access to critical inputs. They urged the government to adopt a predictable policy environment that facilitates long-term planning and growth.
Commerce Minister Jam reiterated the government’s focus on export-led growth, stressing both immediate and long-term strategic measures. He assured exporters that their recommendations would be compiled and presented to the Prime Minister for further action.
It was decided to actively pursue the expansion of Pakistan’s export footprint in the US, turning the current tariff reduction into a sustained national advantage for broader socio-economic development.
Separately, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal held a meeting with representatives of Octans Digital Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Interloop Holdings, to discuss sustainability and waste management in Pakistan’s textile industry.

An official statement issued here said that Mr Gandapur chaired the meeting of cabinet and talked about law and order situation and condemned anti-state elements attempting to destabilise the country. He said that terrorism was unequivocally unacceptable as it impacted all people equally.
He said that provincial government adopted a proactive strategy and established jirgas to build public trust and enlist community support in the fight against terrorism. He said that proliferation of terrorism would not be tolerated and writ of government would be upheld without compromise.
The chief minister said that operations and forced displacement of civilians were not his government’s policy. He confirmed that no authorisation was given for such actions. He said that Section 144 was imposed in Bajaur to protect locals.

Cabinet approves establishment of camp for displaced persons

He said that it was duty of provincial government to provide all necessary support to those people, who voluntarily relocated owing to targeted operation. He said that there would be no negligence in that critical responsibility. He said that civilian casualties resulting from counter-terrorism efforts were unacceptable.
Mr Gandapur said that federal government expressed willingness to engage in negotiations with Afghanistan. He stated that provincial government was currently preparing its groundwork in that regard.
The meeting also granted approval for a wide range of departmental agenda items aimed at advancing the province’s development goals.

• Nine personnel martyred in ambush near Iran border; attack on police station repulsed
• FO welcomes US decision to declare BLA, Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist groups
• Police vehicles targeted in Sibi, Quetta
QUETTA: Security forces have gunned down 50 terrorists over the past four days, as they foiled an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan’s Zhob district, said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) in a statement on Tuesday.
In the Sambaza area of Zhob district, 47 terrorists were killed following “successful engagements by security forces” from Aug 7 to 9, it said. In the same area along the Pak-Afghan border, three more “Indian-sponsored” terror­ists were killed during a “saniti­sation operation” on the night of Aug 10-11, it said, adding that arms and ammunitions were seized from their possession.
 
 

The statement referred to these militants as ‘khawarij’, a term used to describe the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban militants. The number of TTP terrorists killed in the four-day operation has risen to fifty,“ the ISPR added.
Nine soldiers martyred
On the other hand, a convoy of security forces was ambushed in the southern Washuk district bord­e­ring Iran on Monday night, lead­ing to the martyrdom of nine pers­o­n­nel, including an officer. The ISPR did not issue a statement by the time this report went to print.
 
 

Six soldiers were also injured in the gun battle between the militants and the security forces in the Basima area of Washuk. Sour­ces said the militants ambu­shed the convoy, and three vehicles came under heavy fire. The secur­ity personnel returned fire, and the battle continued for an hour.
“An officer and eight other secu­rity personnel embraced martyrdom while fighting bravely, and six others sustained injuries,” a senior security official said on the condition of anonymity. He said the injured were shifted to the nearby health facility, adding that casualties also occurred on the other side.
The militants also attempted to attack a police station in Basima recently handed over to the police, but the policemen deployed there repulsed it sucessfully, the official said, adding that the fight continued for half an hour. Three policemen were inju­r­ed. “Blood marks on the ground and a motorbike confirm casualties on the other side,” he claimed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday commended the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in the Sambaza area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, APP reported.
The president and prime minister, in their separately issued statements, “appreciated the security forces for killing 50 Indian-sponsored terrorists in the last four days as a testament to their professionalism, bravery, and determination”.
BLA, Majeed Brigade designation
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office welcomed the United States’ decision to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations, also adding Majeed Brigade as an alias to BLA.
 
 

The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, besides being committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.
Also, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in an interaction with the media in Hyderabad termed the designation of Majeed Brigade and Balochistan Liberation Army by the US a success. He said it was the endorsement of Pakistan’s viewpoint by the US.
He said these separatist outfits openly supported India during May’s Pak-India conflict, adding the UN should make such a declaration as well so that international financing to these outfits could be curtailed.
Quetta and Sibi attacks
Furthermore, a police officer was injured in a grenade attack in Sibi, while a police vehicle on patrol escaped a bomb blast in the provincial capital.
Officials said that an unknown motorcyclist hurled a grenade at a police vehicle in Sibi on Monday night near the Government Girls College. The grenade exploded close to the police vehicle and injured a police officer, who was on snap-checking duty in the area.
In Quetta, a police vehicle escaped a roadside bomb attack that occurred on Link Badini Road near the Eastern Bypass. The explosion, however, destroyed a car which was passing through the area. The man driving remained unhurt. “The target was a police vehicle…but it passed the area a minute before the blast,” a senior police officer said. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.

An interim charge sheet was filed in May against prime suspect Armaghan Qureshi and Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari.
In the final document, the investigating officer (IO) Muhammad Ali said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was the house of Armaghan in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
 
 

He said the victim, Mustafa, had informed his friend Rafay over the phone before going to the house of the prime suspect. Rafay’s statement had been recorded, he added.
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from a car in the Hub area.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
According to him, pending forensic reports from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency had since been received, confirming that the CCTV footage was unedited and had not been tampered with.

Public transport will not be allowed to operate on highways across the province from 5pm to 5am. Route permits of companies found violating the ban will be cancelled.
The decision was announced during a meeting chaired by Muhammad Hayat Kakar, the provincial transport secretary, on Tuesday.
 
 

Representatives of transporters attended the meeting. The meeting resolved to enforce the Home Department’s directives restricting night travel.
Mr Kakar said all deputy commissioners across the province had been instructed to take measures to halt public transport operating during the night.
Transporters have been directed to install trackers in their vehicles, deploy security guards, and comply with the government’s anti-smuggling measures.

The warning comes as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasts heavy monsoon rains and increased risks of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions.
UNOCHA’s report highlights that Pakis­tan’s geographical location along tectonic fault lines and its exposure to extreme climate variability make it highly susceptible to earthquakes, floods, droughts and other hazards.
These challenges are compounded by political instability, regional conflicts and security issues.

PMD forecasts heavy rains, Glofs, landslides in several parts of country

The report stresses the urgent need for Pakistan to prioritise disaster risk reduction, strengthen early warning systems and invest in community resilience. It also calls for improvements in governance and resource management to effectively address future emergencies while safeguarding long-term development.
“Floods are among the most recurring and damaging disasters, affecting millions of people each year. The devastating 2022 floods alone impacted over 30 million people, causing economic losses equivalent to nearly six per cent of the national GDP,” it says.
In addition to natural disasters, the country is grappling with the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events and disrupted agricultural cycles. Droughts, especially in arid regions, exacerbate water shortages and severely impact agriculture and livestock.
Another monsoon spell
From Aug 14 to 22, Pakistan is expected to experience another spell of monsoon rains, as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned of urban flooding in the country’s upper regions. It has also raised con­­cerns about Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and KP.
Monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea will continue to penetrate the upper regions of Pakistan.

• House witnesses passage of five, introduction of 16 bills
• Fatyana moves Constitution amendment bill seeking creation of West Punjab province
ISLAMABAD: A day after causing a rumpus and boycotting the National Assembly over the conviction of party leaders in the May 9 riots, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers returned to the house on Tuesday for the private members’ day proceedings, allowing Speaker Ayaz Sadiq to complete the legislative agenda, as the assem­bly passed five bills and introduced 16 more.
On Monday, PTI members had lodged a strong, noisy protest and staged a walkout, protesting the convictions of party leaders in connection with the riots.
At the outset of Tuesday’s sitting, the opposition members, led by Asad Qaiser, again staged a walkout from the house when Mr Sadiq refused to give them the floor to move a privilege motion against the authorities denying them a meeting with incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan at Adiala Jail.
As the PTI members started leaving the hall, raising slogans, the speaker once again offered facilitation in the talks between the government and the opposition and went one step forward by nominating Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and veteran PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar to engage the opposition.
When Mr Sadiq asked the opposition to propose two names from their side to become a part of negotiations, the latter sought time to come back to him after holding an in-house consultation.
He stressed that dialogue was the only way to resolve political differences and offered to act as a bridge between the government and the opposition.
He also referred to the arrest of Indian Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, noting that even in that case, no “production orders” were issued. He emphasised that no forum was greater than the National Assembly and the Senate as a “grand jirga”, and urged all political forces to come forward to strengthen parliament.
Mr Sadiq said that in the past, he had facilitated the government-opposition talks, alleging that it was the opposition, not the government, that had withdrawn from the negotiation process.
The speaker asked the protesting PTI members to make their talks with the government conditional on the permission for them to meet Imran Khan in jail. “Put this before the government as your demand,” he said.
While refusing to grant PTI leaders the floor to move a privilege motion, the speaker said that such a motion could only be allowed if the members faced hurdles in fulfilling their parliamentary duties, whereas such a question did not arise if someone was not allowed to meet any person.
PTI’s Aamir Dogar argued that the five PTI lawmakers who had gone to meet Imran Khan in jail were denied entry, describing the denial as a breach of privilege.
Mr Qaiser also protested over the non-inclusion of his private member bill granting the right of appeal to the civilians convicted by military courts before a high court.
Law Minister Tarar acknowledged that the bill was being vetted by the law ministry, stating that the government could also bring a similar bill. The minister also reiterated the talks offer from the government, stating that “dialogue is the beauty of democracy”.
He said the confrontation would produce no result, and political issues must be settled by the politicians themselves.
PTI’s Iqbal Afridi also hit out at the speaker over his alleged failure to protect the lawmakers who were last year picked up by the law enforcement agencies personnel from the premises of the Parliament House.
As soon as the opposition members staged a walkout, the speaker started taking up the agenda, which included the introduction and passage of the bills, including those moved by the PTI members.
The speaker expressed his surprise to see Riaz Fatyana and other PTI members back in the house only to move their bills. They said that they had staged “a token walkout” and that they had come back with the permission of the party to introduce their bills.
The National Assembly passed five bills, including the Legal Prac­titioners and Bar Councils (Amend­ment) Bill, 2025; the National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Acid and Bum Crime Bill, 2024; the Reservation of Special Seats for Deserving Persons in Universities Bill, 2024; and the Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2025. These bills, many of which had already passed through the Senate, were approved by the assembly.
The house also saw the introduction of 16 bills, including a Constitution amendment bill seeking the creation of “a separate province within Punjab, comprising two divisions, namely Faisalabad and Sahiwal, calling it “West Punjab”. This is the first time that such a bill has been introduced in the parliament, as the house has been discussing the formation of South Punjab and Hazara provinces for many years.
The other bills introduced in the assembly included the Public Interest Disclosures (Amendment) Bill, the Guardians and Wards (Amendment) Bill, the Prevention of Obscenity and Indecency in Digital Media Bill, and the Multi-Vendor Electricity Distribution Bill.
Later, speaking on points of order, several PPP lawmakers from Sindh, including Nabeel Gabol from Lyari, protested over long power outages in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi.
The National Assembly will meet again today (Wednesday) at 11am.

“Modi’s India has emerged as a rogue state. This is a strategic new abnormal attempted to be imposed on South Asia by a hegemonic power next door,” she said while speaking at the Institute of Regional Studies on “Pakistan’s Strategic Global Outreach”. 
“It is not business as usual — it is a deliberate attempt to normalise dangerous escalations. Pakistan is not dabbling in an imaginary narrative. Our diplomacy is rooted in ground realities and verifiable facts. Narrative alone cannot be the basis of statecraft,” Senator Rehman emphasised. 
“Modi has brought the Gujarat model to all of India, which is a classic case of Moditwa, a beleaguered India. This doctrine openly prioritises confrontation over dialogue. It openly embraces conflict. It wants to identify an enemy within the country and an enemy without. The enemies within are the Muslims and other minorities, and the enemy without is Islamabad. They have used narrative building as a tool for hostile unilateralism in a hyper-charged, nuclearised environment,” added. 

Says Islamabad’s diplomacy rooted in ground realities, verifiable facts

Sherry Rehman, who is also PPP vice president, said Modi has four ambitions to fulfil: “First, Modi’s India continues to seek to manipulate terrorism as a domestic and international dog whistle, fomenting and supporting instability inside Pakistan, which is totally unacceptable. Second, it negates all calls for bilateral or mediated diplomacy as a tool for engagement, which mature countries do, while targeting Pakistan with aggressive calls for isolation across multilateral forums. That is not happening either, which you can see from the US to China, or the region. 
“Third, it builds a motive for military action as a coercive tool — from cross-border strikes to air-based attacks. It is not a doctrine based on power, it is a doctrine based on fear. Fourth, it embraces unilateralism as the only path on key disputes, including Kashmir. It weaponises a settled Indus Water Treaty by attempting to create irreversible facts on the ground. Israel does the same.” 
The PPP leader said the May limited war redefined deterrence dynamics, yet India and the Modi government remain intent on attempting to cement this “new abnormal” as the region’s status quo. 
Highlighting Pakistan’s diplomatic mobilisation, she credited the coordinated leadership of the prime minister, army chief, Foreign Office and PPP chairman. “Our delegations went from capital to capital during a diplomatic deficit, speaking truths on the ground that others were not hearing. It was a pivotal moment to position Pakistan as a serious, emerging, moderate medium power.” 
Senator Rehmen accused India of creating a gap between reality and fiction even within its own country. “The Modi government has fallen into a commitment trap, driven by BJP-RSS culture and domestic political compulsion.” 
She said India’s institutional framework is in decline, with the government increasingly relying on crisis creation — both internal and regional — to maintain control. 
“From entertainment to mainstream media, India has blurred the line between truth and propaganda. The war showed the world what this abnormality looks like — from the weaponisation of water to fictionalised claims of military successes. India even claimed to have shot down Pakistani aircraft three months after the conflict, but provided no proof,” she added. 
The PPP leader warned against India’s repeated attempts to weaponise water. “This is a completely mala fide intention — turning a treaty into a dispute and breaching long-standing red lines. Once cross-border rivers become weapons, consequences will be dangerous. 
“Pakistan will never accept unilateralism, nor the weaponisation of water, sovereignty, or narrative. We have always sought dialogue, but we cannot repeatedly request engagement from a state that speaks the language of toxicity. The time has come to expose India’s rogue behaviour on all fronts,” she urged.

• Emphasises Pakistan needs modernised irrigation system instead of canals
HYDERABAD: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday demanded a new National Finance Commission (NFC) Award in light of the 18th Amendment introduced in 2010, which devolved several departments and ministries from the Centre to provinces.
Speaking to reporters at a media briefing held at the recently renovated Niaz Stadium after inaugurating Khan Bahadur Hassan Ali Effendi Peoples Park in Qasimabad, the PPP chief said the previous NFC Award preceded the 18th Amendment and since several departments were devolved to provinces with responsibilities, resources should also be allocated to them.
“A new NFC should be formed and the award should be announced forthwith as per constitutional provision,” he said. “It is the incompetence of the Federal Board of Revenue that they don’t collect revenue, and this burden cannot be shared by provinces. It is the fault of Islamabad’s babus (civil servants). Provinces should be given their right so that they can discharge their responsibilities,” the PPP leader added.
He said Balochistan was experiencing a ‘hybrid war’ and federal institutions’ personnel were deployed there to fight terrorism, adding there was a concept of winning hearts and minds in the world because some wars could not be fought with weapons alone. “The federal government should therefore talk to provinces and come up with a new NFC with consensus,” he added.
Speaking about the rumoured 27th Amendment, the PPP chairman said his party had not been approached by the government. “Neither the prime minister nor any federal minister has approached us with proposals of amendments,” he said when asked to comment on the speculations surrounding the supposed amendment.
“I am hearing things about the 27th Amendment, but neither the premier nor any federal minister discussed with me any amendments. The 26th Amendment (passed last year) was a product of political understanding among parliamentary parties; although one party had differed with it due to its personal grievances. PPP conceded ground in ensuring this amendment should get through parliament instead of going for the ‘brute majority option’,” he added.
IWT treaty
About the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), he said India was still reeling from its defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the May conflict and that’s why it reacted cowardly by announcing the ‘unilateral suspension’ of the IWT.
It may be noted that New Delhi held the IWT in abeyance after the April 22 Pahalgam attack and later doubled down on its action, saying it would ‘never restore’ the treaty.
He said that he raised his voice over the issue of the IWT and terrorism. He said India will have to release water for three rivers, failing which Pakistan, being the lower riparian, would demand its right for six rivers.
“The entire country should raise its voice against (India’s) Modi’s attack on IWT,” he said, while also stressing the need for a modern irrigation system. Pakistan needed a modernised irrigation system, as dams and canals were considered by states having surplus water. “Pakistan doesn’t have surplus flows and we need to use available flows efficiently,” he added.
The PPP leader also thanked the US president for slapping maximum tariffs in the US history against India in the wake of their own trade war. “Since the US is not pressing for ‘do more’, Pakistan should capitalise on it as much as possible,” he said. After Pakistan’s victory over India, the military leadership got an edge and this victory was guiding Pakistan’s present discourse, he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said democracy’s health in Pakistan was not encouraging due to repeated martial laws. “Even a weakened democracy is due to the sacrifices of the PPP leaders. We want institutions to remain in their limits and only then can we push back other institutions in their domain…” he said. But on May 9, certain forces crossed their own limits, he added.
He claimed the Higher Education Commission got most cuts in the budget, be it the incumbent or the PTI government, but Sindh released matching funds to keep the HEC alive, shouldering federal and provincial responsibilities. He added that the PPP wanted a university in every district.He agreed with a journalist that Hyderabad’s airport should be made functional, saying that he would discuss it with the prime minister because Air Sial was launched in Punjab and an airport was built. He said if the federal government didn’t agree to their proposal, then the Sindh government would consider launching Air Hyderabad. He regretted that even the Moenjo Daro airport remained dysfunctional.

Despite this, I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent, those who accepted our killing, and those who suffocated our very breaths.” Journalist Anas al-Sharif’s final message was posted on his X account within hours of the targeted Israeli strike that killed him and three of his colleagues in Gaza on Sunday.
The voice of Anas al-Sharif, the Al Jazeera correspondent whose live coverage had informed the world about the ongoing Israeli genocide, has been silenced. But his last message should be enough to prick the conscience of those who have remained quiet, silently accepting the mass killing of Gaza’s hapless people.
Al-Sharif was yet another journalist killed in the line of duty. According to Al Jazeera, shortly before he was killed, he wrote on X that “Israel had launched intense, concentrated bombardment — also known as ‘fire belts’ — on the eastern and southern parts of Gaza City”. He knew he was being targeted but never backed out of his responsibility. Reportedly, he told a colleague: “I will not leave Gaza except to the sky! I will not leave Gaza even if I am killed.”
Al-Sharif had been reporting from Gaza since the Israeli invasion of October 2023, and was on Israel’s hit list. While acknowledging his killing, the Israeli military accused the journalist of being a Hamas operative — not the first time Israel has labelled slain journalists as such.

Al-Sharif had been reporting from Gaza since the invasion and knew he was on Israel’s hit list.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 186 journalists have been killed since Israel commenced its military strikes on Gaza after the October 2023 Hamas attack. It has been described as “the deadliest period for journalists since [CPJ] began recording such data in 1992”. “Israel is killing the messengers,” said the CPJ. The Watson School of International and Public Affairs’ Costs of War project recently revealed that the Gaza conflict “has killed more journalists than the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War … the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s, and the post 9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined”.
Israel has banned journalists from reporting its genocidal war in Gaza. Most of the reports in the Western media on the Gaza war have come through Israeli military sources, which largely cover up Israel’s war crimes. Al-Sharif’s ‘crime’ was that he had recently been reporting on the starvation caused by Israel’s refusal to allow food and other humanitarian supplies into the devastated territory — for several months now. He reported how Israeli soldiers killed people waiting desperately for food. Some two million people are on the brink of starvation. Hundreds of children have perished because of hunger. In April, António Guterres warned of a catastrophic situation in Gaza. “Gaza is a killing field, and civilians are in an endless death loop,” he asserted.
His comments followed the appeal of the heads of six UN agencies to the world community to take quick action to ensure that food and aid reached the Palestinians. But the international community appears helpless before the impunity of the Zionist state. The scale of killing and devastation seen in Gaza has few precedents in recent times. It could not have happened without the tacit support of the US and some other Western countries. In the words of al-Sharif: “Not even the mangled bodies of our children and women moved their hearts or stopped the massacre that our people have been subjected to for over a year and a half.”
The apathy of the Arab nations, in particular, towards the genocide is no less than abetment of the Zionists’ crime. They are keeping quiet even after the murder of al-Sharif and other journalists, who put their lives in jeopardy to inform the world about Israel’s crimes. They are sitting on the fence even as tens of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children are killed by Israel.
Israel is intensifying its military operation in Gaza as its far-right government recently announced plans to permanently take over the enclave, thus pushing the entire population of the occupied Strip into a concentration camp. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press briefing that Israel had “no choice” but to proceed because Hamas had not surrendered. It’s just an excuse for the Zionist state that wants to annex the occupied territory. It may also be the reason why, as Al Jazeera pointed out, the latest killings of journalists by Israeli forces were “a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza”.
Netanyahu’s plan to militarily occupy Gaza will have serious consequences for global peace. According to the UN chief, it “marks a dangerous escalation and risks deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Pales­tinians”. The planned move has raised eyebrows among certain Western countries (including some that had backed Israel’s military offensive). The foreign ministers of Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the UK condemned Israel’s plan in a joint statement, saying it risked “violating international humanitarian law”.
But the US is silent on Israel’s expansionist plan. Many analysts believe that the plan has the tacit approval of President Donald Trump, who, earlier this year, had suggested the complete evacuation of the population of Gaza to turn the territory into a “Riviera”. The US has also vetoed every resolution in the UN Security Council for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. No wonder Netanyahu has nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Anas al-Sharif’s murder and last message have heightened  public anger across the globe against Israel. But will the international community act now to stop Israel’s genocidal war?

It stood on a pillar made of political sand, which has collapsed. Let us brace ourselves for the reality that the IWT is no more; let’s rejoice and move on with the opportunities this situation has brought.
Surprisingly, neither India nor Pakistan was facing water shortages when the treaty negotiations started. It was triggered through political prejudice alone — India shut down the canals emanating from the head works now under its control (after Partition) but feeding irrigated land in Pakistan. It was a war crime according to the Rome Statute. The dispute was immediately hijacked by players of the Cold War. It was seen as an opportunity to prevent India from drifting into the communist bloc and Pakistan from becoming another Korea — were war to break out over the Kashmir dispute.
Based on this premise, David E. Lilienthal, the former head of Tennessee Valley Authority, proposed a ‘solution’ and wrote to Eugene Black, president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), that there were business opportunities for the bank in the implementation of his proposal regarding the Indus Basin.
Lilienthal’s solution, however, defied science. First, it suggested that both countries build infrastructure to prevent the river waters from reaching the sea — a death sentence for the world’s sixth largest mangrove forest and the Indus Delta, which is an environmental system of global significance. Second, it supported an illusion of greening the deserts through canals.
The IWT allowed the complete shutting down of three large rivers, with no provision of environmental flows downstream, which was unprecedented. The final nail in the coffin was driven by letting India dispose of unlimited contaminants into the empty riverbeds of the Ravi and Sutlej flowing into Pakistan.

Neither India nor Pakistan was facing water shortages when the treaty negotiations started.

International water treaties are negotiated to safeguard the rights of lower riparian jurisdictions. Primarily, a treaty is needed to protect a lower riparian from excessive diversions upstream, which may reduce the flow downstream; extreme damming upstream, which disrupts the natural rhythms of flow downstream; and dumping polluted waste upstream, which contaminates the water quality and impacts the environment downstream.
The IWT, however, has allowed, first, all practicably possible diversions to the upper riparian (and what was not practically feasible was ‘given’ to the lower riparian); second, an unlimited number of dams upstream (with some conditions); and, third, uncapped pollution from upstream. In other words, the treaty completely deprived the lower riparian of its rights. This is, thus, not a treaty to safeguard the lower riparian but a licence for the upper riparian to violate all international provisions and the rights of the lower riparian. From a lower riparian’s perspective, it is not a treaty, but a surrender.
 
 

A treaty is generally negotiated when the initial positions of two parties are different. Negotiations bring the two parties somewhere between their initial positions — give and take is involved. In the IWT’s case, India’s initial position was to get 100 per cent of the waters of Ravi, Beas and Sutlej (eastern rivers) and 7pc from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab (western rivers).
Pakistan’s initial position was to retain 100pc of the western rivers and 70pc of the eastern rivers. After years of negotiations, India not only got 100pc eastern and 7pc of the western rivers, but also the permission to dump unlimited and untreated waste in the Ravi and Sutlej downstream into Pakistan. In effect, Pakistan had forfeited all its rights as a lower riparian and surrendered to all of India’s demands.
The big question is, what circumstances forced, tricked or lured Pakistan into signing such an agreement. Apparently, it was a condition set by IBRD, that in order to get financing for building two large dams (on the Indus and Jhelum), Pakistan must sign an agreement with India for the closure of the eastern rivers as was proposed by the IBRD in 1954. Perhaps the lure of funds for megaprojects was too much to resist with little thought for the long-term repercussions of such an agreement. The latter, when finally signed in 1960, went down as an annexure to the funding agreement between IBRD and Pakistan and had nothing to do with India. It was only in 1962, when on India’s request, the document was added to the UN’s register of international treaties, and thus the agreement gained the status of an international treaty.
The consequences are nothing short of an ecocide — from stunted growth, gastrointestinal diseases and renal conditions among those exposed to the pollution in the Ravi and Sutlej to the annihilation of the Indus delta. Billions were spent on the thousands of kilometres of canal infrastructure in India’s Rajasthan desert; the infrastructure lies buried under sand dunes. The ecosystem around the diverted rivers is severely degraded, with not even one per cent of the desert greened.
Pakistan got the two dams which have since been silted (dry winters in 2024-25 brought both the Mangla and Tarbela reservoirs to dead level), but lost the rivers permanently. The 1960 agreement which was hailed as a means to prevent war failed as early as 1965, and later as well.
India had nothing to gain by getting out of this treaty and Pakistan has nothing to lose. Thanks to the ignorance of Mr Modi, we have been given a chance to reclaim our forfeited rights as lower riparians, demand restoration of shutdown rivers and call for ending all the contaminated waste being dumped in the Ravi and Sutlej from India. Science and the current global mind is already with us. SDG-6, for example, cannot be implemented as long as the pollution allowed by the treaty persists. To move with the rest of the advancing world, we must get rid of the ills the IWT has brought and work towards a healthy future for the coming generations. With this background in mind, we should seriously think of our way forward. Sticking with the treaty should not be an option.

Among the main drivers of distrust, lately, is India’s unilateral ‘holding in abeyance’ of the Indus Waters Treaty, thereby threatening Pakistan’s rights over shared rivers.
New Delhi took this rash step in April after the Pahalgam attack. However, the Indian move is not standing up to international legal scrutiny. For example, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague recently stated in an award that India must “let flow” the waters of western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”. The award in question is related to arbitration Pakistan initiated in 2016. An earlier award by the court in June had similarly held that India could not unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance. Displaying rigidity, India had earlier said that it does not recognise the court. Pakistan has welcomed the latest award.
However, India’s attempts to isolate Pakistan are not limited to creating obstructions on Indus waters. Attempts are also afoot to depict Pakistan as an irresponsible nation where the nuclear issue is concerned. With reference to a speech Pakistan’s army chief reportedly made in the US recently, Indian media outlets have made some sensationalist claims.
The Indian external affairs ministry, using unverified reports as a peg, has accused Pakistan of “nuclear sabre-rattling”, while alleging that extremists could ‘compromise’ Islamabad’s nuclear decision-making. The Foreign Office says the field marshal’s comments have been “distorted”. These talking points are not new, but the Indian media — and, specifically, the Indian government — should avoid making controversial accusations, especially with regard to the nuclear issue. Both sides, particularly New Delhi, must handle this sensitive area with care.
Historically, ties have never been perfect. In the past, the Pakistani state has made mistakes and rebuffed India’s peace gestures. The Kargil misadventure is a case in point. But with the Modi regime’s anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan rhetoric, ties have entered very dangerous territory.
It may well be true that following the Pakistan-India armed skirmish in May, and the subsequent warming of relations between Islamabad and Washington, New Delhi has been ‘rattled’. Its attempts to isolate Pakistan globally have failed, hence perhaps the desperate moves to question the safety of this country’s nuclear arsenal.
Instead of indulging in combative rhetoric, both sides must bring down temperatures in South Asia. India should particularly act with restraint, as sensationalist allegations can lead to further deterioration in ties, and may even trigger renewed conflict. While peacemaking is a distant dream at the moment, both sides can at least ensure that matters do not worsen. Meanwhile, India should listen to what neutral experts are saying about Pakistan’s rights over Indus waters, and refrain from making any moves that could vitiate matters.

“The war we fought in May was not a conventional war alone; it was a combination of cyber warfare and the war with weapons,” she said, adding that Pakistan emerged victorious in the hybrid war with India.
“We succeeded in making our infrastructure secure,” she said while highlighting that to ensure protection against cyberattacks the country was working on cybersecurity regulations.
“I suggest our youth to be aware of cybersecurity and we want to make cyberspace safe for children and women,” Ms Fatima said. She also said that as technology advances, the need for cyber security is increasing.
She expressed these views while speaking at ‘Next Gen Cyber Resilience Workshop and Telecom Cybersecurity Award 2024-25’. “We are moving towards a Digital Nation Pakistan,” she said, adding that the Pakistan Telecomm­unications Authority (PTA) is working for cyber security and internet connectivity will improve with the addition of two submarine cables.
 
 

As the ministry is working on a national fiberisation policy, Ms Fatima said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said relevant legislation should be made regarding right of way. “But we need Amendments in the Telecom Act regarding right of way,” she added while admitting that spectrum in Pakistan was limited.
PTA Chairman retired Maj Gen Hafeezur Rehman suggested that people would have to trust and adopt modern technology as it was moving very fast into all walks of life. “We are already behind the world. While we are striving for 5G in the country, China is now talking about 6G,” he said.
He also talked about the challenges of posed by Artificial Intelligence. “AI is being used for fake audio and video messages,” he remarked.
He said that the PSARB rules were almost ready, after the registration of relevant companies the low-orbit satellite-based internet would be launched in Pakistan in near future.
“But along with these, we have to look at the aspect of sovereignty and security of Pakistani data,” he said, adding, “We have to ensure safe use of the internet and social media and the safety of citizens.”

There was no immediate comment from India’s foreign ministry.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern flowing rivers. Pakistan fears its neighbour India could choke its main water supply, with 80 per cent of the country’s agriculture and hydro-power dependent on those three river flows.
In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
 
 

The court, in its ruling that was posted on its website on Monday, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said.

Hague court says India’s hydropower projects must strictly adhere to treaty

Pakistan’s Attorney General, Mansoor Usman, said in an interview on Tuesday that, by and large, the court had accepted Pakistan’s position, especially on the design issue of the new hydropower projects.
“I am sure it is clear now that India cannot construct any of these projects in violation of the court’s decision,” he told Reuters.
 
 

Pakistan’s foreign ministry said that the court ruling said that India had to “let flow” the waters of the three rivers for Pakistan’s unrestricted use. The court said its findings are final and binding on both countries, according to the Foreign Office statement.
However, an Indian official pointed to a June statement by India’s foreign ministry, which said India has never recognised the existence of the Court of Arbitration.
PM issues fresh warning
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch “even one drop” of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.
“I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop from Pakistan,” he said.

Referring to the mini­ster’s remarks, the PAC, chaired by Junaid Akbar, decided to summon the Mini­stry of Interior, State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and other relevant autho­rities in its next session to provide a detailed briefing on the matter. “We will obtain complete records to determine which bureau­crats have acquired plots,” said the PAC chairman.
The committee also discussed the imposition of sales tax in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and decided to seek a briefing on the closure of utility stores, when it meets next week.
During the meeting, audit objections relating to the Ministry of Religious Affa­irs were reviewed, including a case of embezzlement by one of its accounting officers, Muhammad Kaleem, involving Rs12 million in remittances, which allegedly caused significant losses to the ministry.
“If an assistant accountant can commit such acts, what is the Director General of Haj doing there?” questioned Junaid Akbar. The ministry’s secretary, Dr Syed Attaur Rehman, informed the committee that the system had been digitised to prevent such irregularities.
Senator Afnanullah Khan noted that despite the fraud, no red warrants had been issued for Muhammad Kaleem, nor had any property been confiscated. Officials revealed that the accused had secured a Canadian visa beforehand and was currently residing in Canada. The ministry claimed it had immediately written to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to lodge an FIR and had dismissed the individual from service.
The PAC chairman asked the Ministry of Interior whether Interpol had been contacted in the matter.
The meeting was informed that Kaleem and his spouse had both been declared absconders. According FIA, both were last reported to be in the US.
The committee expressed dismay that, despite four years having lapsed, the ministry had shown no interest in pursuing Kaleem to recover approximately Rs43m embezzled.
It also questioned the ministry about its staffing in Saudi Arabia. PAC members raised concerns over the number of officials posted there and their year-round duties. “We don’t need as much staff from Pakistan. We require more local staff,” officials responded, adding that 1, 700 staff engaged for Haj duties – to assist pilgrims - were provided return tickets annually.
Lawmakers suggested that Pakistani workers already based in Saudi Arabia should be employed for seasonal duties. “I never see these officials - I don’t know where they go,” remarked Senator Mohsin Aziz.
When asked whether government employees were sent for Haj free-of-cost each year, the Secretary of Religious Affairs clarified that only Haj assistants - all of whom were government employees - received such facilitation. He further proposed that, from next year, only assistants in Grade 11 and above would be appointed, adding, “No one performs a free Haj except these assistants.”

Funds for Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan will be released on a biannual basis due to seasonal constr­aints, accor­ding to the min­istry’s Mont­hly Development Update for August 2025, released by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday.
According to the update, the Ministry of Finance notified the funds release strategy for the FY26 devel­o­p­ment budget, under which 15 per cent of the Rs1 trill­ion PSDP is required for disbursement in July-Septe­mber, followed by 20pc in October-December, 25pc in January-March and the rem­a­i­­ning 40pc in April-June.
This strategy has been chall­enged by the Ministry of Plan­n­ing, which believes low disbu­r­sements in the first quarter negatively impacted project off-take. The minister has directed the Ministry of Fina­nce to increase first-quarter PSDP releases from 15pc to 20pc and reduce last-quarter rele­ases from 40pc to 30pc to ensure steady project execu­tion throug­hout the year, accor­ding to a written statement.

AJK, GB to get funds on biannual basis due to ‘seasonal constraints’

The Ministry of Planning has accordingly authorised the release of Rs141bn (about 14pc of the PSDP outlay) in the third week of July. “Releases to the Azad Jam­mu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are to be made biannually due to seas­onal constraints,” for which the Ministry of Planning has written to the Ministry of Finance.
On the occasion, Mr Iqbal said that Pakistan’s economy had entered a phase of susta­ined stability, with all major macroeconomic indicators showing positive trends during 2025. GDP growth is on an upward trajectory, inflatio­nary pressures have eased significantly, and both exter­nal and fiscal sectors have stabilised, the minister said.
 
 

In July alone, exports grew by 17pc, reaching $2.7bn compared to $2.3bn in the same month last year, which showed the gover­nment’s “priority to ensure continuous growth in exp­orts as a driver of economic progress”, he said.*
The minister said the country recorded a current account surplus of $2.1bn in FY25, compared to a $2.1bn deficit the previous year — marking a positive turnar­ound of $4.2bn, the highest surplus in 22 years. Remittances also increased by 7.4pc in July, reaching $3.2bn, indicating strong confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the government’s economic management, he said.
On the fiscal front, the minister said the deficit declined to 5.4pc of GDP, the lowest in eight years, while the primary balance posted a surplus of 2.4pc of GDP — its highest level in 24 years. “Improved fiscal discipline has enabled the government to spend over Rs1.068tr on development projects in FY2025, achieving a historic 98pc utilisation rate,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said global confidence in Pakistan’s economy had strengthened, with international financial institutions and rating agencies acknowledging the turnaround. Barron’s described Pakistan’s recovery as a “macroeconomic miracle”, while Fitch, Moody’s and S&P upgraded the country’s ratings and outlook.
The pace of price increases has fallen sharply, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropping to 4.1pc in July 2025 from 11.1pc in July 2024, and the annual inflation rate down from 38pc to just 4pc, he said, quoting the development outlook, adding that “this downward trend in inflation is expected to continue, providing relief to the people”.
The minister noted that the Pakistan Stock Exchange crossed the 141,000 mark on Aug 1, driven by a new trade agreement with the United States, which secured the lowest tariff rates in South Asia. “It is now up to our business community to take full advantage of this opportunity,” he added.
Talking about the agriculture sector, he said that for the first time, comprehensive national agricultural data had been collected through the 7th Agriculture Census 2024, which will support evidence-based policymaking for food security, climate resilience and rural development.
In July 2025, the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) approved eight major projects and recommended three to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), expected to create over 2,000 jobs. Cost rationalisation measures saved Rs40bn in development projects, reflecting a strategic and efficient approach to public sector planning.
On the technological front, Pakistan successfully launched its Remote Sensing Satellite from China on July 31, 2025, which will aid in agriculture monitoring, urban planning, disaster management and climate change analysis, Mr Iqbal said, adding that in 2026, Pakistan’s first astronaut will conduct scientific experiments in collaboration with China.
He said that under the Prime Minister’s Ba-Ikhtiyar Naujawan Internship Programme, the Uraan Overseas Summer Internship Scholar Programme received over 2,300 applications from 45 countries, with 31 top-performing students selected and placed in key divisions of the Planning Commission.
He reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating export-led, technology-driven projects under the PSDP 2025-26, with a focus on youth and women empowerment, climate resilience and inclusive development.
“Pakistan’s macroeconomic stability, coupled with structural reforms and strong international partnerships, is driving private sector growth and innovation. The government is determined to sustain this momentum to secure a prosperous and resilient future for the nation,” he said.

The statement comes a day after the US State Department added the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list. The US said the move, long-desired by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while signalling strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.
A post from the US Embassy in Islamabad on X said the Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo and Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker participated in the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue, advancing their shared resolve to combat the global threat.
“We remain committed to countering terrorism in all its forms,” the embassy said.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement the dialogue was co-chaired by Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo, adding that the two delegations underscored the critical importance of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, including those posed by the BLA, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“The US applauded Pakistan’s continued successes to contain terrorist entities that pose a threat to the peace and security of the region and the world. Furthermore, the US expressed condolences for the loss of civilians and members of law enforcement agencies in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, including the barbaric Jaffar Express terrorist attack and the bombing of a school bus in Khuzdar.
“Both delegations emphasised the importance of building stronger institutional frameworks and developing capabilities to respond to security challenges and to counter the use of emerging technologies for terrorist purposes,” the FO said.
It added that sides reaffirmed their intention to work closely in multilateral fora, including the United Nations, to promote effective and enduring approaches to counterterrorism.
“Reaffirming the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and the US, both sides emphasised that sustained and structured engagement remains vital to countering terrorism and promoting peace and stability.”
 






LoGerfo also called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, according to the Foreign Office, adding that the latter was briefed on the discussions held during the dialogue.
Dar encouraged sustained and structured bilateral engagement on counterterrorism between both countries as a “vital contributor to peace and stability in the region and beyond”, the statement said.
 






The last US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue was held in May of last year, where both countries reaffirmed the continuation of counterterrorism cooperation to advance regional and global security and stability.
On Sunday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations. He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have an official face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
The two had discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington. During the meeting, Trump had “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”.
FM Dar had met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — was considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US. Secretary Rubio had recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
In June, United States Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla had praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups such as the IS-K.
Of late, it seems that Islamabad and Washington are in lockstep. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an IS-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president’s day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’.
After securing what seems to be a major discount in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor interest in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned.</p><small>2025-08-13 00:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1309350872009d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930572/over-30000-repatriated-to-afghanistan-from-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Over 30,000 repatriated to Afghanistan from Quetta</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Over 30,000 Afghan nationals illegally living in Quetta division have so far been sent to Afghanistan in less than a month, official sources said.
All illegal Afghans living in Pakistan were asked by the government to return to their country by July 31st.
A large number of Afghan refugees went back to Afghanistan after the deadline fixed by the Pakistani authorities expired, but a large number of refugees did not go back to their country.
Due to this situation, the government decided to launch a legal action against them and joint teams of police, Frontier Corps, FIA and district administration were formed that took action against the Afghans who had ignored the Pakistan government’s deadline.
On Tuesday, a meeting, chaired by commissioner of Quetta division, Shahzeb Khan Kakar, reviewed ongoing crackdown launched against illegal Afghans living in the province.
The meeting was attended by deputy commissioner of Quetta retired Captain Meharullah Badini, assistant commissioner Kaleemullah and representatives of police, FIA, Nadra, special branch, PTA, home department and other relevant agencies. Deputy commissioners of Qila Abdullah and Pishin as well as the SP of Pishin joined the meeting online.
The officials concerned informed the meeting that coordination between all agencies and institutions had been strengthened to speed up the operation against illegal Afghans. 
The commissioner instructed participants of the meeting to carry out operation against undocumented Afghans daily, and record of all illegal residents’ bank accounts and mobile SIMs be collected. 
He stressed the need for involving local elders and community leaders to ensure that the process of sending illegal Afghans back to their country takes place in a peaceful manner.
The commissioner also directed that special care must be taken regarding women and children during the operation, and that all departments must work in close consultation and coordination to devise an effective strategy to ensure repatriation of all illegal Afghans to Afghanistan.

The fast bowler blew away the Pakistan top order en route to figures of 6-18 as the tourists were bundled out for just 92 in a chase of 295 to win.
The Windies had reached 294-6 in their 50 overs batting first, powered by captain Shai Hope’s brilliant unbeaten hundred.
The Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
Pakistan’s reply got off to a horrendous start as Seales removed Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan inside the first three overs to reduce them to 8-3.
Seales then trapped Babar Azam lbw for just nine to leave Pakistan’s hopes of a 2-1 series win in tatters.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took two wickets through the middle overs, before Seales returned to remove tailenders Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah and complete a six-wicket haul.
Pakistan had started strongly with the ball after winning the toss and electing to field, as the West Indies struggled to find the boundary.
The home side were 68-3 when Keacy Carty was dismissed lbw by Abrar for a 45-ball 17.
The usually big-hitting Sherfane Rutherford also never got going and crawled to 15 from 40 deliveries.
But Chase helped revive the innings with a quickfire 36, before being bowled by Naseem. Motie was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz as the West Indies batting effort threatened to peter out.
But Hope and Justin Greaves plundered 110 runs from the final 8.1 overs in a blistering assault to get their team close to 300. Hope finished on 120 not out.

Ukraine’s authoritative DeepState war map showed on Tuesday that Russian forces had advanced by at least 10 kilometres north in two prongs in recent days, part of their drive to take full control of Ukraine’s Donetsk region.
The advance is one of the most dramatic in the last year, although military analysts said the Russians were using small groups of soldiers to try to establish footholds and that it was uncertain if they could maintain their positions in the face of a Ukrainian pushback.
DeepState said the Russians had surged forward near three villages on a section of the frontline associated with the Ukrainian towns of Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk, which Moscow is trying to encircle by exploiting Kyiv’s lack of manpower.
“The situation is quite chaotic, as the enemy, having found gaps in the defence, is infiltrating deeper, trying to quickly consolidate and accumulate forces for further advancement,” DeepState said on its Telegram channel.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss a possible deal to end the war in Ukraine when they meet in Alaska on Friday. Unconfirmed media reports say Putin has told Trump he wants Ukraine to hand over the part of the Donetsk region that Russia does not control.
The Russian Defence Ministry said units of its army grouping “Centre” had improved their positions on the edge of the frontline.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed that groups of Russian soldiers had advanced about 10km in several places.
“They are without equipment, only weapons in their hands. Some have already been found, partly destroyed, partly captured. We will find and destroy the rest in the near future,” he said.
Zelenskiy claimed the Russian push was part of an attempt by Moscow to shape the narrative ahead of the US-Russia summit to show that Russia was “moving forward and Ukraine is losing”.
Pasi Paroinen, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, said the situation had escalated rapidly, with Russian forces infiltrating past Ukrainian lines to a depth of roughly 17km in the past three days.
“Forwardmost Russian units have reportedly reached the Dobropillia — Kramatorsk road T0514, and Russian infiltration groups have also been reported near Dobropillia proper,” he wrote on X.
 






Pro-Ukrainian open-source military analysts were divided on how significant the development was, with some saying that Russia’s tactic of sending small groups to quickly seize but not necessarily hold territory for long had made mapping the war much harder.
Konrad Muzyka, director of Rochan Consulting, said the Russian thrust, although it appeared sudden, was the culmination of more than a week of infiltration and positional gains.
Leverage
Tatarigami_UA, a former Ukrainian army officer whose Frontelligence Insight analysis tracks the conflict, posted: “In both 2014 and 2015, Russia launched major offensives ahead of negotiations to gain leverage. The current situation is serious, but far from the collapse some suggest.”
Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said the Russians had been able to advance amid “a partial collapse in the front” due to Ukraine’s shortage of soldiers.
“This breakthrough is like a gift to Putin and Trump during the negotiations,” Markov said, suggesting that, if sustained, it could increase pressure on Kyiv to cede some land to prevent the Russian army from eventually taking the rest of Donetsk by force.
To do that, though, Russian forces would first need to take control of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka and Kostyantynivka — which Russian military analysts call “fortress cities”.
Zelenskiy has publicly pushed back against the idea of ceding territory to Russia, saying any peace deal must be a just one.
Bohdan Krotevych, former chief of staff of Ukraine’s Azov brigade and a National Guard lieutenant colonel, took to X late on Monday to warn Zelenskiy of the threat, saying the frontline in the area was “a complete mess”.

The HPV vaccine protects against genital warts and most cases of cervical cancer. Estimates indicate that every year in Pakistan, 5,008 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 3,197 die from the disease. It is also the third most common cancer in women nationwide and the second among those aged 15 to 44.
The Sindh government recently announced it would launch an HPV vaccination campaign in September for schoolgirls aged nine to 14. Studies and clinical trials consistently showed that HPV vaccines were extremely effective at reducing infections with the types of the virus that can lead to cancer, as well as cervical precancers.
An event titled ‘Safeguarding Girls’ Futures’ was organised by Aga Khan University’s Department of Paediatrics and Child Health today, aiming to raise awareness about HPV, share global evidence on the vaccine and address cultural, religious and gender-related concerns.
The event was attended both in person and virtually by public health experts, representatives of non-governmental organisations and government officials, including Dr Muslima Ejaz, Dr Fyezah Jehan, Professor Karim F. Damji, Sindh Health Secretary Rehan Iqbal Baloch, Dr Quamrun Nahar, Dr Paul Bloem, Dr Afshan Issani, among others.
“Science is offering us the chance to prevent cervical cancer before it begins,” Dr Ejaz told the audience.
“Globally, cervical cancer claims over 300,000 women’s lives each year, with the greatest toll in low and middle-income countries. In Pakistan, it remains the leading cancer in women, often diagnosed far too late. But today, we are not here to speak only of disease. We are here to speak about prevention.”
Dr Jehan pointed out that the rates of infection from HPV depended on factors such as age, gender, sexual behaviour and geography. “There are more than 200 types [of HPV] which are known to us, and these are mostly classified for risk purposes into low-risk and high-risk types,” she added.
“Infections in the low-risk [type] are mostly asymptomatic and self-resolving,” Dr Jehan stated. “However, HPV 16 and 18 — the virus strains of particular interest — are among 14 high-risk HPV types responsible for 70-80 per cent of all cervical cancer cases. These deaths are entirely preventable, but only if we act early.”
Addressing the audience, the Sindh health secretary said, “The target [of the vaccine campaign] is around four million, out of which 50pc are in school and 50pc are out of school. Mostly the focus would be on girls aged nine to 14 years.”
He added that Gavi, a public-private global health partnership working to expand vaccine access in lower-income countries, was providing support. However, he stressed the need for greater advocacy from parents, teachers, paediatricians and gynaecologists.
Among all obstacles in the vaccine rollout, Dr Jehan said the cost and supply of the HPV vaccine were not an issue, as global donor agencies, particularly Gavi, in partnership with the government, had ensured the necessary doses were available free of charge through the Expanded Programme on Immunisation.
“This is a vaccine that people used to pay Rs7,000 for; now it is completely free and easily accessible,” she told Dawn.com.
She stressed, however, that public perception could pose a barrier and there was a need for greater awareness to ensure uptake. Dr Jehan added that reaching the 2m out-of-school girls will be a major challenge, despite planned efforts.
While most people are familiar with conventional preventive vaccines that boost the body’s natural defences against foreign invaders, currently only two approved vaccines can reduce the risk of cancer by protecting against viral infections that cause the disease.
These are the hepatitis B vaccine and the HPV vaccine. As Dr Issani pointed out, “There are very few strategies that can be used to prevent cancer, and the cervical cancer vaccine is one of them.”
Last month, the District Health Authority in Chiniot planned to immunise a total of 111,101 girls aged between nine to 14 for HPV.
In March, health experts at a seminar in Peshawar also advised women to undergo regular checkups for cervical cancer screening to prevent complications.</p><small>2025-08-12 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12213632bfce8c7.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930476/fm-dar-to-visit-dhaka-on-aug-23-amid-rapid-progress-in-pak-bangladesh-relations' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar to visit Dhaka on Aug 23 amid rapid progress in Pak-Bangladesh relations</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to visit Dhaka on August 23 amid a rapid progress and warming in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.
However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
Dar was previously due to visit Bangladesh in April. Questioned today (Tuesday) by Dawn.com about reports of his visit to Bangladesh on Aug 23, he confirmed: “Yes”.
Bangladesh’s leading news agency Dhaka Tribune had reported the same last week, adding that Dar was due on Aug 23 to “discuss ways to strengthen coordination with Bangladesh”.
The report had said that FM Dar would have a meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Aug 24, in addition to his other engagements.
Last month, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.
The deal in principle, marking a breakthrough in bila­teral relations between the two states, was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Bangladesh’s Home Minister Jahangir Alam Chowdhury.
Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch had visited Dhaka in April for Foreign Office Consultations after a 15-year break in diplomatic engagement with Bangladesh.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone conversation with Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus in March where the two leaders reaffirmed their shared desire to further strengthen bilateral relations.
In February, both countries started direct government-to-government trade after decades of troubled relations with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice.
In January, the militaries of Pakistan and Bangladesh had stressed the need for the “enduring partnership” between the two countries to “remain resilient against external influences”.
Direct private trade between the countries restarted in November 2024 when a container ship sailed from Karachi to Chittagong. It was the first cargo ship in decades to sail directly between the countries.
During a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the D-8 summit of developing nations in Cairo in December, Yunus had expressed the desire to resolve outstanding grievances from Dhaka’s 1971 separation from Islamabad.
“The issues have kept coming again and again. Let’s settle those issues for us to move forward,” the AFP news agency had quoted Yunus as telling PM Shehbaz, according to a statement from the former’s office.</p><small>2025-08-12 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/122208018004021.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930473/you-cannot-snatch-even-a-drop-from-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-warns-india-on-restricting-water-flow' target='_blank'><strong>‘You cannot snatch even a drop from Pakistan,’ PM Shehbaz warns India on restricting water flow</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch “even one drop” of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.
India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions. A day ago, the PCA issued an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad today, the prime minister said: “I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop from Pakistan.”
The prime minister warned that if India attempted such an act, “you will be again taught such a lesson that you will be left holding your ears.”
“Our air force shot down six of their jets, among which four of them were Rafales,” PM Shehbaz added.
 


The prime minister’s warning comes a day after former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the IWT’s suspension an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and said the nation would not back down if New Delhi forced it into war.
“If war is waged, then from the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you,” he had said.
Similarly, while on a weekend visit to the United States, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had reportedly warned that Pakistan would never allow India to choke the Indus River and would defend its water rights at all costs, even if the forces would have to destroy any controversial dam that India sought to build on it.
“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he reportedly told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”
Lauds role of minorities, announces laptop scheme
The prime minister also conveyed his wishes for Independence Day to the representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh and Parsi communities present at the event.
“The brothers and sisters of the minority communities also played an integral role in the movement for Pakistan,” he said, adding that not only did they play a role in the founding of the country, but also played a role in its development of the country.
Speaking on the May conflict between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said: “The way we smashed the enemy in this conflict, they will remember it for a lifetime.”
He called upon the youth to play a role in the development of Pakistan and announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed amongst the high achievers all over the country.</p><small>2025-08-12 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121502181ea157d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930420/phc-halts-appointments-of-new-na-senate-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PHC halts appointments of new NA, Senate opposition leaders</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz from their respective roles.
On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in three cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were removed from their posts through notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.
A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up separate petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.
PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.
 
 

The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.
The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.
During the hearing, Gohar informed the bench of the details of recent developments. “When an MNA becomes the opposition leader, then the ECP’s role does not remain anymore,” he asserted.
“May 9 was an unfortunate incident, which should not have happened,” the PTI leader said. He contended that the ECP recently also disqualified MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 by “citing the wrong reference of the [2012] Azhar Siddique case”.
“We won 180 seats, entered the parliament with 90 seats, and are now left with 23,” the PTI lawyer lamented.
“Now the government wants to bring another party’s opposition leader,” Gohar claimed, requesting the court to issue directives to stop any further action against Ayub and Faraz.
A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.
The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.
Gohar laments ‘season of disqualifications’
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Gohar called for the “season of disqualifications” to come to an end.
“These disqualifications are not the solution to any issue,” the PTI leader emphasised. “I will request everyone to come to their senses now.”
Refuting reports of friction within the party leadership, he asserted: “There is no weakness in our team; we are being oppressed.”
Gohar also reaffirmed the PTI’s intention to stage gatherings across the country on August 14 to “celebrate Independence Day and raise voice” for ex-premier Imran Khan’s release, despite the government’s call to reschedule the protests.
 
 

A statement issued by the PTI and attributed to Imran has termed August 14 as the “next important day” of the party’s fresh protest movement.
However, Gohar also acknowledged the need for a dialogue to solve the ongoing political crisis.
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Ayub highlighted “rising” inflation in the country. “These people (government) are enjoying themselves by burdening the people of Pakistan,” he said.
He alleged: “There has been a scandal of more than Rs500 billion in the petroleum sector. There was another scandal worth Rs2,000bn which has come to light.”
Sentences against opposition pile up
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court on July 31 had senten­ced over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Ayub, Faraz, PTI’s Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among the key opposition leaders handed rigorous imprisonment.
 
 

They were convicted under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a case registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.
In another case registered at the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted.
In the case filed at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and one person was handed a three-year jail term, while 77 were acquitted.
Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three cases.
The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.
 
 

Separately, on July 23, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced dozens of PTI leaders, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On December 21 and Dec 26 last year, a military court sentenced 85 civilians, including ex-premier Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
However, days later, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were later accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas had been processed to Courts of Appeal.
Issues of disqualifications, convictions can only be resolved by sitting down for talks: law minister
Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “Issues of disqualifications, convictions can only be resolved by sitting down for talks, not by waving documents in the air.”
Speaking in the Senate while addressing the opposition, Tarar said, “I will not go into debate on punishments, but on May 9, people saw Jinnah house burning.”
He added that if anyone commits a crime, there is a legal course which must be followed, and within that course, there are legal remedies like interim relief. “This is how the judicial system works,” he said.
He also spoke about PTI MNA Jamshed Dasti was provided relief by the Lahore High Court after his disqualification.</p><small>2025-08-12 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121809292a34ebd.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930460/35-police-personnel-suspended-in-gb-over-protest-for-daily-allowance' target='_blank'><strong>35 police personnel suspended in GB over protest for daily allowance</strong></a><br><p>Local police in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Hunza and Gilgit districts on Tuesday suspended 35 of their own personnel and halted their salaries after they staged a sit-in demanding benefits.
Last night, hundreds of police personnel, both men and women, protested in front of the Chief Minister’s House, demanding an increase in their daily allowances and continued the demonstration throughout the night.
In two separate notifications issued by the Reserve Police (RP) of Gilgit and the senior superintendent of police of Hunza, 26 police personnel were suspended in Gilgit yesterday, while nine more were suspended in Hunza today.
The notification issued by RP Gilgit cited “grave misconduct/violation of government servant conduct” as the cause of suspension, while the notification from the Hunza simply cited that they had participated in a protest.
Both notifications, copies of which are available with Dawn.com, added that the suspended personnel’s salaries had also been stopped.
The GB police claimed on social media that 63 personnel had been dismissed from service for breach of discipline, but no notification has been issued yet.
It also said that strict departmental action has been initiated against the personnel involved in a breach of discipline.
The department said that discipline was the “fundamental characteristic and key identity” of the police service, and that its violation would not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“Behaviours violating discipline will be dealt with strictly to maintain the transparency and efficiency of the institution,” it added.
Police officers had staged a separate sit-in two weeks ago. After failing to be dispersed by violent police action, they were persuaded to end the protest through negotiations.
However, due to a lack of progress and assurance that the issues would be resolved within the stipulated time, the protests began again last night.
The organisation of protesting police also announced that in the next stage of the protest, they would demand that security duties not be given to government officials, officers, religious figures and Chinese residents.
A sit-in protest by traders is also currently underway on the Karakoram Highway, entering its fourth week as of Sunday. The ongoing protest, which is against taxation policies and the suspension of customs clearance at Sost dry port, has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass.</p><small>2025-08-12 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12183300a501fed.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930465/pmd-forecasts-more-rains-thundershowers-across-country-from-aug-17-as-monsoon-activity-intensifies' target='_blank'><strong>PMD forecasts more rains, thundershowers across country from Aug 17 as monsoon activity intensifies</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers in most parts of the country in the coming days, with monsoon activity expected to intensify from August 17.
At least 312 people, including 142 children, have died and 740 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country. The dead include 113 men, 57 women and 142 children, while the injured include 243 children, 209 women and 288 men.
In its latest weather advisory issued today, the Met Office said monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were continuously penetrating the upper parts of Pakistan, while moist currents from the Bay of Bengal were likely to strengthen midweek.
A westerly wave currently affecting the region was also expected to intensify from Aug 17.
Under these conditions, rain-wind/thundershower with scattered heavy falls was expected in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan from Aug 14 -17.
The wet spell was expected to last from Aug 18-21 in many northern areas, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, and several districts of GB.
 






From Aug 18-21, KP would witness widespread rains, with heavy to very heavy falls in districts such as Dir, Swat, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Peshawar and Mardan.
Southern districts, including Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan, would also receive showers with occasional heavy spells.
Punjab, including Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, and Faisalabad, was likely to experience heavy rains from Aug 18-21, with scattered activity in southern districts.
Parts of Balochistan, including Barkhan, Zhob, Khuzdar, Gwadar, and Panjgur, as well as several Sindh districts, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, and Tharparkar, were also expected to receive showers between Aug 18-22.
The PMD warned that heavy rains may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs of KP, Murree, Galliyat, northeast Punjab and AJK from Aug 15-21, and hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern Balochistan from Aug 18-21.
Urban flooding was also expected in low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Peshawar, and Nowshera during the same period.
Landslides and mudslides might disrupt roads in hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galliyat, and AJK, while heavy falls, windstorms, and lightning may damage weak structures such as rooftops, walls of mudhouses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
The public, travellers and tourists were advised to avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable areas and remain updated about the latest weather conditions.
