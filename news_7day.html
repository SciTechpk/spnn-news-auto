Asif made the remarks during an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan for Zeteo. The full interview is behind a paywall but the media company has shared a five-minute preview as well as clips on social media.
On September 17, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also comes just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
Previously, Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework. However, in a subsequent interview the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
In the preview posted on Zeteo’s website on Friday night, Hasan asked Asif about the defence pact.
“How much of it is a reaction to the Israeli bombing of Qatar?” he asked.
“It is not a reaction to what happened in Qatar because this was being negotiated for quite some time. So it’s not a reaction; perhaps it must have sped it up a bit but that is all. It was already in the offing,“ Asif replied.
Hasan then pointed out that Pakistan was the only nuclear power in the Muslim world, noting that Saudi Arabia had expressed interest in being the second. He also pointed out that Asif had previously stated that nuclear weapons “were not on the radar” for this pact.
“Is Saudi Arabia protected by Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella per this agreement or not?” he asked.
“We have had a very long defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, spanning five or six decades. We had a military presence over there, perhaps more than four or five thousand at the peak and we still have military presence over there. I think we have just formalised that relationship which was previously a bit transactional,” Asif responded.
“Formalised with or without the nukes?” Hasan probed.
However, the minister refrained from going into the details.
“I will refrain from going into the details but it’s a defence pact and defence pacts are normally not discussed publicly,” he said.
Hasan then pointed out that journalist Bob Woodward, in his 2024 book War, had quoted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman telling a US senator that he could “just buy” a bomb from Pakistan.
“I think that is just sensationalised […] No, I don’t believe that quote,” the minister replied.
“So you are not in the business of selling nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia?”
“No. We are very responsible people,” Asif responded.
Pak-China ties
In a separate video shared on Instagram, Hasan asked the minister whether Pakistan’s now close relationship with the United States could jeapardise its vital relationship with China.
“Obviously, America and China are at loggerheads,” he said.
“No, we are not worried about that because it’s a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s,” Asif replied.

When probed further about Pakistan “flirting” with the US, the minister said that China was not worried in this regard.
“Is your strategic future with China or with the US? It can’t be both,” Hasan pointed out.
The minister responded by saying that China had been a “very reliable ally” for Pakistan.
“A major portion of our arms are from China. And our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before,” he said, adding that this was due to the “unreliability of other sources, like the US”.
“So are you basically saying that your strategic future is with China, not the US?” Hasan asked.
“Yeah […] they are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share geography,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-09-27 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271202137325e98.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944960/south-korea-scrambles-to-restore-services-after-major-state-data-centre-fire' target='_blank'><strong>South Korea scrambles to restore services after major state data centre fire</strong></a><br><p>A major fire at South Korea’s national data centre has crippled some government online services and internal networks, prompting a race on Saturday to bring the systems back online and a probe of what sparked a lithium-ion battery to start the blaze.
The fire is suspected to have started with an explosion on Friday night of the battery produced by South Korea’s LG Energy Solution during maintenance, damaging some servers and forcing the shutdown of hundreds of others, officials said.
The fire led to a “thermal runaway”, producing extreme heat in the server room at the National Information Resources Services in the city of Daejeon, preventing firefighters from taking aggressive actions to contain the blaze, fire and government officials said in press briefings.
The national data service acts as a cloud server for many government services and databases for the heavily wired Asian country. It operates data centres in other locations.
The fire, which began around 8:20pm (4:20pm PKT), was brought under control early on Saturday, but more than 600 servers remained in forced shutdown to protect data while firefighters worked to extract nearly 400 battery packs from the building as safety measures, officials said.
The cause of the initial spark was not known and was under investigation, they said.
LG Energy Solution declined to comment as the case is under investigation.
Some government ministries, the mobile identification system, the postal service, and the government legal database were among websites that remained down on Saturday after the fire in Daejeon, about 140 km (90 miles) from the capital Seoul.
Some ministries are unable to use email, according to notices to reporters.
Prime Minister Kim Min-seok apologised on Saturday for the inconvenience to the public from disrupted services and said the government would work swiftly to restore services. In the meantime, tax payment deadlines coming soon would be delayed, he said.
“There were difficulties in containing the fire because of the nature of critical government systems being concentrated at one site,” Kim told a televised emergency meeting.
The internal networks of some government agencies in Daejeon and nearby Sejong were “paralysed”, Kim said. There was no estimate for when services would restart, the head of the data centre, Lee Jae-yong, told a briefing.
One person has been treated for a minor injury, a fire official told another press briefing. There was considerable fire damage at the location of the initial blaze on the fifth floor of the building, fire official Kim Ki-seon said.</p><small>2025-09-27 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271146074142095.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944873/quadripartite-moot-urges-kabul-to-counter-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Quadripartite moot urges Kabul to counter terrorism</strong></a><br><p>NEW YORK: The foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, in a joint statement, have urged Afghan­istan to take “effective, concrete, and verifiable actions” to dismantle terrorist groups operating from its territory.
The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil.
The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan.
They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.”
 






The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”.
The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan.
 
 

The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions.
They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution.
They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

• 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says
• Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced
ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains, the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m.
More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala.
 
 

The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts.
Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes.
According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes.
Health facilities
A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara.
In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed.
By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability.
 
 

The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases.
Educational institutions
According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools.
Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15).
Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur.
 
 

Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal.
Livestock
Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity.
Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days.
Ex-gratia assistance
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion.
The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded.
The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued.
The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

Farming, water supplies and hydropower across much of South Asia rely on the seasonal rains, but research shows climate change is causing longer dry spells punctuated by bursts of extreme rain.
Derived from the Arabic word “mausim”, or season, the monsoon is a reversal of winds driven by differences in land and sea heating. These patterns are observed in several places on Earth.
In South Asia, the southwest monsoon brings rains that start in southern India in late May and sweep north until September.
By October, the northeast monsoon begins. As the land cools, winds blow seaward, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal before raining over southern India and Sri Lanka.
“Climate change is beginning to reshape the behaviour of the Indian monsoon,” the Indian government said this year, warning of “more frequent” long, dry stretches and “more intense” wet spells.
Extreme daily rainfall events rose about 75 per cent between 1950 and 2015, according to India’s Meteorological Department.
Nearly half the season’s rain now falls within “just 20 to 30 hours”, a government briefing note said.
In Pakistan, the monsoon arrived earlier than usual this year, and “excessive” rain fell in the last week of June.
By mid-August, the country had received 50pc more rain than last year, according to disaster authorities.
Role of climate change
The full impact of climate change on monsoon patterns is not entirely clear because of the complexities involved in seasonal rains.
But “there is a tendency and expectation for more intense and perhaps prolonged monsoons”, said Agus Santoso at University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre.
Warmer seas evaporate more moisture into the air, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, he explained.
“So when it rains, it pours.”
But there are other considerations, including the impact of El Nino and La Nina weather patterns, which are themselves more variable, “likely due to climate change”, added Santoso.
 
 

And predicting future changes is complicated, said climate scientist Shakil Romshoo of the Islamic University of Science and Technology.
“In most of the Sub-continent and mountainous regions in the world, we don’t have a very dense network of observation,” he said.
This makes it “difficult to discern patterns and predict.”
The impact
The monsoon has long brought floods and landslides to South Asia, but the annual toll has risen over the last decade, experts in India said.
This year, heavy rains also devastated Punjab, where rain surged nearly two-thirds above average.
Erratic rains impact soil health and irrigation timing.
“A delay or failure in this season can affect food supply, livelihoods, and the wider economy,” according to an Indian official.
In Pakistan, over 1,000 people have been killed in this year’s monsoon, nearly triple the figure last year, and rains have prompted massive evacuations in Punjab.
Standing water can carry disease or encourage reproduction of vectors like mosquitos. Flood damage and evacuations also threaten livelihoods and education across the region.
Glacier melt
“Accelerated glacier melt” and deforestation weaken rain-soaked slopes and raise the risk of deadly landslides, acc­ording to the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Dev­elopment.
And vast highways, tunnels, dams and railways carved into mountains without adequate environmental checks only worsen the problem, experts say.
“Rapid, unplanned development, deforestation, river-channel modifications, and poorly sited infrastructure destabilise slopes and block natural drainage,” said Anjal Prakash, climate scientist at Bharati Institute of Public Policy.

On September 25, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had addressed a UNSC session on artificial intelligence. However, photos from his speech had spread like wildfire on social media platform X as users had pointed to Junejo sitting in the background and shared several screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel.
Following the social media furore, Asif clarified that he had given the speech instead of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the latter had other engagements; the premier has been attending the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said.
The defence minister said that for the past 60 years, he had an emotional attachment and personal commitment to the Palestine cause. He added that he had Palestinian friends and colleagues while working in Abu Dhabi and was still in contact with them.
 






“My views on Gaza are clear and I express them openly,” he said, expressing his hatred for Israel and Zionism.
“Who is this woman, why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf,” Asif said.
He said that his account on X was a testament to the fact that his relationship with Palestine was part of his faith.
Subsequently, in a post on X late on Friday night, the FO said that it had noted the queries regarding “the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC”. The FO did not explicitly name Junejo.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” it said.
“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/foreign minister,” it added.
 






Meanwhile, Junejo also took to X and posted screenshots of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
 






“Youthias are calling me a Zionist when for the past two years I have tweeted about Gaza almost daily, calling [Israeli PM] Netanyahu a war criminal and showing Israeli atrocities,” she said.
The term “youthia” is a derogatory term commonly used as a slur for PTI supporters.
“Once again, this entire campaign has been launched against me because they only fear me,” she said.
Uproar
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari had stated that one could not sit behind a minister in the UNSC or the United Nations General Assembly unless they were identified as an official representative of the government.
“So who allowed this to happen and why? Is there a covert policy agenda at work viz rogue entity Israel, Bagram base, Abraham Accords? GoP needs to come clean — who is responsible?” she asked.
 






Mehlaqa Samdani, the director of the Community Alliance For Peace and Justice, said: “To include Shama Junejo, who champions a pro-Israel and pro-normalisation agenda, in Pakistan’s #UNGA delegation is not a good look for Pakistan.”
 






Meanwhile, journalist Ahmad Noorani said that questioning Junejo’s patriotism or “branding her ‘pro-Israel’ over her views on diplomacy is disgraceful”.
“This vile smear campaign is being pushed by dirty-minded trolls,” he said.

Summarily, the HPV vaccine is administered to prevent certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which can lead to cancers such as cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and head and neck cancers, as well as pre-cancerous lesions. An Aga Khan University study estimates that over 80% of sexually active people will acquire HPV at some point in their life.
But even as the vaccine is rolled out to mitigate the spread of the virus, it is the mix of dis- and mis-information by so-called social media ‘influencers’, irresponsible politicians and an ill-informed and ultra-conservative religious lot, which is both distressing and annoying.
Below are some frequently asked questions about the vaccine, and brief answers that may clarify some of these myths.
What is the status of the vaccine in other countries?
Pakistan is now among around 150 countries — around 76 per cent of the UN member states — that recommend the HPV Vaccine. The majority of these countries have included the vaccine in their routine national vaccine programmes.
With the exception of Afghanistan, Pakistan is the last country in South Asia to introduce the routine HPV vaccination programme, and so is the case in the Muslim world. All major Muslim-majority countries have already taken this step.
Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country in the world, started introducing the vaccine in 2016, established a National Cervical Cancer Elimination Plan in 2023 and is now locally producing the vaccine. In Iran, the vaccine was made available for personal use two decades ago, and in May 2025, Iran started producing two versions of the HPV vaccine.
Is cervical cancer a major health problem in Pakistan?
More than 95pc of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases occurring globally each year are caused by HPV. Every two minutes, a woman dies from this preventable disease globally, and 90pc of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.
According to official data, around 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed every year in Pakistan, out of which 3,200 affect women, resulting in 64pc deaths. The detection of pre-cancer stage or cancer requires regular screening among women of reproductive age through the Pap test and the specific HPV test.
Since such screening for various reasons does not take place in Pakistan, nor do we maintain a national cancer registry, we don’t know the actual number of cases and deaths. Globally, and in Pakistan, cervical cancer is among the top cancers affecting women.
What is cervical cancer and what causes it?
The cervix is an anatomical part between the vagina and uterus which connects them. HPV can cause sexually transmitted infections which can result in the development of precancerous lesions or warts on the inner surface of the cervix.
This was discovered by Dr Hérald zur Hausen, a German virologist, who won the Nobel Prize in 2008 for his important research. It proved that certain strains of HPV (namely HPV 16 and 18) could eventually cause cervical cancer, which led to the development of the HPV vaccine.
 
 

The interval between the acquisition of HPV infection and progression to invasive carcinoma is usually 15–20 years or longer.
Most HPV infections remain asymptomatic, but once cancer develops, there will be unusual bleeding and discharge. There may also be persistent lower abdominal pain and weight loss.
How much does this vaccine protect against cervical cancer?
Scientific evidence shows that this vaccine provides 90pc protection against developing cervical cancer if the injection is provided to young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 years. In relative terms, this is a very high level of protection.
Is it right for Pakistan govt to include HPV vaccine in its national programme?
Absolutely yes! From a public health standpoint, it may not be the most important and common health issue being faced by women in Pakistan, but since we don’t know the exact extent of it and since we have a vaccine that can prevent this cancer, so, why not protect our women against this scourge?
Other key health issues of women in Pakistan, like anaemia, maternal mortality, and breast cancer, must also be attended to as a priority. In 2020, 194 member states of the World Health Organisation, including Pakistan, launched a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.
One important element of this strategy is to prevent cancer by immunising young girls.
Why young girls? Because the vaccine is most effective when given just before or at the start of the sexual and reproductive life of the girl.
Is HPV vaccine safe?
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the HPV vaccine, Gardasil 4 by Merck, in 2006. Since then, the WHO Prequalification Programme has approved at least five different HPV vaccines, including single-dose vaccines for their safety, quality and efficacy. There are hardly any side effects, and if at all, these are very minor and rare.
Which vaccine is exactly being used in Pakistan?
The Pakistan Federal Directorate of Immunisation is using the HPV vaccine called Cecolin. It is manufactured in China and is supplied through Gavi — the global vaccine alliance. It is a single-dose vaccine.
 
 

WHO prequalified this vaccine in October 2024 for its quality, safety and efficacy and the decision was made based on new data on the product that fulfilled the criteria set out in WHO’s 2022 recommendations for alternative, off-label use of HPV vaccines in single-dose schedules.
Research has shown that the single-dose vaccine is not inferior to the double-dose one in terms of providing immunity. The single-dose vaccine will, however, contribute to improving a more sustainable supply of HPV vaccines, allowing more girls to be reached.
Previously, HPV vaccine introductions have been hampered by global supply shortages.
Who is financing the HPV vaccine supply, globally and in Pakistan?
Donors globally have committed nearly $600 million towards the elimination of cervical cancer. Funding includes $180m from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $10m from Unicef, and $400m from the World Bank.
In Pakistan, currently, 95pc of the vaccine delivery is financed by global sources through Gavi and five per cent of the funds are provided by the government. This is a standard mechanism. In due course of time, however, Pakistan has to foot the full bill from domestic sources.</p><small>2025-09-27 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/270820414a963e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944940/oval-office-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Oval Office meeting</strong></a><br><p>COMPARED to the coldness of the Biden administration towards Pakistan, bilateral relations under Donald Trump’s watch have warmed up considerably.
Early on Friday, the prime minister and the army chief met the American leader in the White House to mainly discuss, as a PM House readout describes, security, counterterrorism and investment issues. Mr Trump had earlier in the week met Shehbaz Sharif in New York, during a meeting with leaders of Muslim states on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss the Gaza war. In June, the army chief had an unprecedented lunch with the American president. This is the first time a Pakistani prime minister has had a dedicated bilateral interaction with a US president in six years; the last interaction was between Imran Khan and Mr Trump in 2019.
Apart from the photos of beaming leaders and mutual appreciation — Mr Trump referred to Mr Sharif as a “great leader”, while the PM called the US leader “courageous” — the details of what was discussed are sketchy. As per the Pakistani side, tensions in the Middle East and South Asia, along with investment opportunities in Pakistan, were mentioned. The PM lauded Mr Trump’s efforts to end the war in Gaza, calling him a “man of peace”.
The US leader may be many things, but a peacemaker he is not, having attacked Iran in June, while if he really wanted to end the Gaza genocide, he could halt all American weapons and funds transfers to the Israeli regime. It is, therefore, hoped that behind closed doors, Mr Sharif convinced the president of the need to immediately end the Gaza slaughter, as well as finding a just solution to the Kashmir dispute.
Should this be seen as a great reset in Pakistan-US ties, or simply a temporary phase of positivity? Historically, the relationship has been a transactional one, with the US supporting Pakistan and providing it arms and aid at key junctures — the Cold War, the Afghan Jihad, the ‘war on terror’ — only to turn ambivalent, or even hostile, once its geopolitical aims were achieved.
 
 

The Biden era was a clear example of American indifference towards Pakistan. Moreover, the incumbent US president is known to change positions overnight, so to formulate future policy on the basis of a few interactions would be unwise. Besides, the foreign policy priorities of Islamabad and Washington diverge considerably in several areas, including the Palestine question, ties with Iran and the relationship with China.
Can Pakistan balance relations with the US while maintaining its principled stand on these issues, particularly its ties with China? The lesson of history is that while better ties with the US should be pursued, Pakistan should be prepared for abrupt changes in American policy.

He also denounced several Western countries for embracing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of pushing his country into “national suicide”.
The Israeli leader, who has an International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes, addressed mostly empty chairs in the UN General Assembly, as scores of delegates — including the Pakistan contingent — walked out when he took the stage.
At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic near Times Square in New York to protest the killing of more than 65,000 people in Gaza by Israeli strikes in less than two years.

“War criminals don’t deserve any peace of mind. They don’t deserve any sleep,” said Andrea Mirez, a young woman who kept up an overnight noisy protest outside Netanyahu’s hotel.
In his speech, days after France, Britain and other Western powers amid worldwide protests against the ongoing war on Gaza recognised the state of Palestine, he showed a map of the Middle East, taking out a pen to cross out adversaries Israel has killed. He also vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, even as President Donald Trump said he thought he had sealed a deal on a ceasefire.
 
 

A senior White House official told Reuters that Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday in Washington with the aim of reaching a framework for a deal.
In his speech, Netanyahu claimed that over time, many world leaders buckled. “They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies and antisemitic mobs… Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals,” he claimed.
However, he did not touch on the issue of annexing the occupied West Bank.

Response to speech
Gaza authorities described Netanyahu’s speech as one “filled with lies and blatant contradictions” and condemned it as a “desperate attempt to justify the war crimes and acts of genocide.”
“Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement.
Also, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, earlier speaking by video after the US denied him a visa, condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a war of genocide”. He thanked the countries that recognised Palestinian statehood, pledged that Palestinian Authority would be ready to govern post-war Gaza.
New coalition to back Palestine
On the other hand, 12 countries — Britain, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland — announced a new coalition to financially support the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority as Israel withheld tax revenues of Palestinian Authority for past two years.
The Emergency Coalition for the Financial Sustainability of the Palestinian Authority “was established in response to the urgent and unprecedented financial crisis” confronting the PA, the Spanish foreign ministry said.
It aims to stabilise the Ramallah-based body’s finances, preserve its ability to govern, provide essential services and maintain security, “all of which are indispensable to regional stability and to preserving the two-state solution”, the statement added.

Perhaps we want more clarity about the war in Gaza, or what our government is doing about the healthcare our family relies on.
It might be something as simple as changes to a bus route that will affect our daily commute. No matter how momentous or mundane the issue, we have a right to news we can trust.
We’ve all been there, scrolling our feed, seeing an astonishing clip, or a shocking must-share story. But now we must constantly question what’s real and what’s the creation of artificial intelligence.
AI-generated output is so convincing today and shaping so much of the information we consume that we risk being unable to trust anything anymore. And mistrust is the fuel that drives conspiracism, social polarisation and democratic disengagement.

Individuals who rely on a deceptive distortion of independent, accurate journalism risk losing themselves in a toxic mire of half-truths and bad-faith manipulation

In reality, the integrity of what we call ‘news’ is being eroded by the tools that are meant to help us make sense of the world.
This World News Day, we want to underline that the public are entitled to the facts that professional journalists and the organizations they work for worldwide are committed to finding, corroborating and sharing.
However, the tech companies building AI systems that millions of people use daily are falling far short of their responsibility to truth.
Original research carried out this year by the BBC found that half of AI-generated answers to news-related requests left out important details and made other key errors.
The AI assistants they tested consistently churned out garbled facts, fabricated or misattributed quotes, decontextualised information or paraphrased reporting with no acknowledgement.
 
 

So what? It’s useful and saves time, it’ll improve, we can live with the errors. Except we’re not talking about a cake recipe or holiday recommendations.
Democracy is at stake, because a society with no common understanding of what’s true can’t make informed choices. And individuals who rely on a deceptive distortion of originally independent, accurate journalism risk losing themselves in a toxic mire of half-truths and bad-faith manipulation.
This isn’t faraway, abstract paranoia. The internet is already inundated with synthetic fakery designed to deceive, drive clicks, and promote vested interests. AI-generated voices, faces, and headlines are degrading the information ecosystem, often with no clear provenance or accountability.
Meanwhile, the output of journalists serving the public interest, especially in local, regional, and independent media, is being scraped without permission, algorithmically repackaged and redistributed with no credit or compensation.
This phenomenon is arguably more pernicious than the glaring, outrageous deepfakes we have all seen because the inaccuracies are subtle, plausible and more likely to mislead. We are witnessing the sabotage of news we need to be able to rely on, and that is draining already depleted reserves of public trust.
So, what can be done?
The European Broadcasting Union and WAN-IFRA, together with a fast-growing collective of other organizations representing thousands of professional journalists and newsrooms around the world, are calling for urgent changes to how AI developers interact with news and the people who produce it.
Many of the broadcasters and news publishers we represent are using AI responsibly to enhance their journalism without compromising editorial integrity, such as through automating translation, helping detect misinformation, or personalising content. They are mindful that the deployment of these tools must be principled, transparent and carefully handled.
That’s why we are presenting five clear requirements to AI tech companies. These are not radical; they are realistic, common-sense standards that any ethical technology developer can and should embrace:
No content without consent: AI systems must not be trained on news content without permission. That content is intellectual property created through rigorous work and public trust. Unsanctioned scraping is theft that undermines both.
Respect value: High-quality journalism is expensive to produce but vital for society’s wellbeing. AI tools benefiting from that work must compensate its creators fairly and in good faith.
Be transparent: When AI-generated content feeds on news sources, those sources should always be clearly cited and linked because accuracy and attribution matter. We are entitled to know where information came from and if it differs from the original.
Protect diversity: AI tools should amplify pluralistic, independent, public interest journalism. A robust, healthy information environment requires a representative cross-section of voices.
Work with us: We invite AI companies to enter a serious, solutions-driven dialogue with the news industry. Together, we can develop standards for accuracy, safety, and transparency, but only if tech companies see journalists as partners, and not as suppliers of free data to be mined and monetised.
 
 

We consider this a civic challenge that affects every person who relies on credible information to make decisions about their life, to form credible opinions or decide whom to vote for.
Tech companies talk a lot about trust, but trust is not built on talk. We’re calling on the leaders of the AI revolution to get a handle on this problem now. They have the power to shape the future of information, but we don’t yet see them taking their tools’ dangerous shortcomings, and the potential consequences of them, seriously enough.
Without urgent, corrective action, AI won’t just distort the news – it will destroy the public’s ability to trust in anything and anyone, which will be disastrous news for us all.

It was not clear why Hegseth has ordered the generals and admirals to meet in one place on such short notice, and two of the officials said this has created uncertainty among the expected attendees.
Senior military officials in some cases command thousands of troops. Most have detailed schedules weeks in advance, which have now been upended.
“People are scrambling to change their plans and see if they have to attend,” one US official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
It was unclear how many officials will actually attend the event, but it is rare to have so many senior officials in the same room at the same time.
Asked for comment, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said only: “The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.”
Trump has ordered the department to rename itself the Department of War, a change that will require action by Congress.
Parnell’s office did not respond to questions about the number of officers, purpose of the meeting or why Hegseth called so abruptly. However, at the White House, US Vice President J.D. Vance claimed that such a meeting was “not unusual at all.”
The US has troops around the world, including in distant locations like South Korea, Japan and across the Middle East, which are commanded by two, three and four-star generals and admirals.
“It’s probably more mundane than people think… (but) the lack of clarity isn’t helping,” the official said.

It said less than two months after a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court acquitted Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, the Indian Army has promoted him to the rank of Colonel. Purohit, one of seven accused tried for their roles in the terror blasts, alongside former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Pragya Singh Thakur, was acquitted after the prosecution failed to prove the case in court.
Special Judge A.K. Lahoti, while acquitting the seven accused, pointed to “grave suspicion” against them but added that “a grave degree of suspicion is established, but not enough to convict the accused persons. Hence, the court has given them the benefit of doubt”. Judge Lahoti further stated, “There can be strong suspicion, but mere suspicion is not enough to punish them”.
The NIA, which claimed it would seek legal opinion to decide whether to challenge the acquittal in the Bombay High Court, has shown no commitment to pursuing the case further. Meanwhile, the families of the six individuals killed in the blast have challenged the acquittal, The Wire said.
Speaking to the media, Purohit’s wife, Aparna, confirmed the promotion. This promotion can be interpreted as a clear stand by the government in support of an individual who was a terror accused for over 17 years.
Minister of Textile Giriraj Singh shared a picture of the pipping ceremony of Purohit and congratulated him. “Congratulations Col. Purohit on being back in uniform. The Govt (government) stands firmly with patriots who serve the nation with courage and integrity,” Singh wrote.
 
 

A serving army officer, Purohit’s arrest in 2008 was considered key in establishing the “motive” behind the blast. The case was initially handled by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and was later taken over by the NIA after its inception in 2009.
According to the ATS, Purohit founded the Abhinav Bharat organisation in 2006, through which funds were allegedly collected and the conspiracy planned. The ATS claimed that Purohit, through this organisation, aimed to establish a “Hindu Rashtra [nation]” with its own constitution, flag, and “government in exile” to be operated from either Israel or Thailand.
The ATS also claimed to have established financial links and invoked sections of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) to investigate pecuniary activities in the case. While the MCOCA charges were dropped in the initial stage of the trial, Purohit and the other accused faced trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

It is gladdening to see how #11YearsOfMakeInIndia has contributed to furthering economic strength and laying the foundation for Aatmanirbharta. It has encouraged innovation and job creation across sectors,” tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this past Thursday.
The nationalist grandstanding was not anything unusual for the Indian PM; it is just what he has been peddling to Indian voters for 11 years. What makes it worthy of notice at this point — when the world is teetering on the brink of the new order — is that Modi’s brand of Indian nationalism is unwittingly clashing with the ultranationalism of American President Donald Trump. Just as Modi has been preaching a new greatness for India so too is the American president selling the same kind of special sauce to his voter base.
On the face of it, none of this would have been a problem. After all, the two sets of ultranationalists, Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base and Modi’s BJP MIGA (Make India Great Again) base are separated by thousands of miles. If anything, during Trump’s first term and the visits each leader paid the other, it seemed to be a recipe for bromance. Thousands of non-resident Indians gathered in Texas cheered on Trump and Modi. Arguably, the vast majority of these NRIs were eager supporters of Modi’s Hindu nationalism, which preached that Hindus were special, resurgent and the only ‘true’ Indians. In simple terms, many Indians — those who support Modi at home and abroad — formed the MIGA base and believed that India was about to be the next superpower.
Clearly, Operation Sindoor was part of this MIGA projection of power. Last May, India calculated that it could attack alleged terrorist bases inside Pakistan and create a spectacle of dominance that would advertise its power both to the MIGA base at home and regional countries. Much has been written about the obvious blunders it made, but the important thing vis-à-vis US-India ties is what happened afterwards. President Donald Trump, eager to burnish his credentials as peacemaker, took credit for the ceasefire. PM Modi, who presents himself to his MIGA base as a demigod, could not allow this. This was the beginning of the end as far as the US-India relationship was concerned.

Many Indians supporting Modi believed their country would be the next superpower.

Then came the tariffs. Once again, warring narratives on either side revealed the constraints of both leaders. Trump — long in love with the subject of tariffs — saw in them a means of bringing India to the negotiating table. His lingering annoyance over Modi’s refusal to give him credit for bringing about an India-Pakistan ceasefire likely increased his urgency to impose them. In Trump’s eyes, India could not have it both ways — protect its market by refusing to allow Americans to sell agricultural products and also present itself as a superpower.
At Modi’s end, Hindu nationalism was the focus. The refusal to allow in dairy products is due in large part to the centralisation of the Hindu identity as Indian identity. The sanctification of cows and cow-related products as part of the Hindu nationalist ethos meant that the market could never be opened to American products that could contain beef byproducts. To Trump and MAGA, this sort of thing was anathema. Just as Hindu supremacy preaches the resurgence of Hindus and their creation of a global network, so too does Christian ultra-nationalism say that these sorts of reservations have to be bulldozed in its own bid for dominance.
 
 

Domestically, the BJP tried to spin the tariffs as a magic MIGA moment in which Indians could build India and buy Indian. Shrill Modi waxed lyrical about how this was a moment in which India could become self-sufficient. Then they started to predict the imminent collapse of the US, now that it was no longer interested in being friends with them. Irate Indian commentators, steeped in the swoon of nationalism for over a decade, declared that they did not need trade with the US and were better off without it.
It is these same delusions that kept a large section of Indians from seeing what was about to happen with the H-1B skilled worker visas. When the $100,000 per applicant fee was announced recently, they were stunned. Few saw how ultra-nationalist Hindutva has led even tech workers to believe that they were indispensable to Americans who they perceived as too unskilled to do the jobs they were doing in the US. Some American publications highlighted the spread of Hindutva in the US, which was not seen as a welcome sign. Add to this the allegations that Indian companies were misusing the programme to bring in underpaid workers and the writing was on the wall. To MAGA ultra-nationalist commentators, like the recently deceased Charlie Kirk and Trump strategist Steve Bannon, Indians had to go so that Americans could take back the jobs that were meant for them. Just as Hindutva preaches Hindu entitlement, so too does nativist white Christian nationalism preach its own brand of entitlement.
Indians hold over 70 per cent of H-1B visas. The new fee applies to new applicants but even those in possession of the visa are likely to face trouble with renewals as companies realise that the administration does not want them to have foreign workers on their payroll if they want to stay on its good side. The advent of AI and the increasing availability of local US workers means that it is unlikely that these policies will be reversed in the near future.
However loudly the MIGA base may shout about America’s decline, in the clash between Hindutva supremacy and its ‘Make India Great Again’ slogan and the Christian nationalists’ ‘Make America Great Again’ dominance the latter has prevailed. Modi and Trump may make up and even strike a trade deal but the architecture through which the Hindutva-fuelled Indian middle class pursued the American dream has collapsed.

For the national side’s head coach Mike Hesson, whose credentials were questioned after India outplayed them in the group-stage and Super Four clashes, Pakistan deserved to be in the final after beating all of their opponents through the course of the tournament apart from the archrivals.
 
 

And it’s India only, who’ll be in Pakistan’s way to their Asia Cup title ambition come Sunday.
“We’ve deserved this opportunity, and now it’s up to us to make the most of it,” Hesson told reporters on Thursday night. “All the games before this were about getting into a position to win the trophy.
“We know that the only match that really counts is the final, and that’s our focus, to play our best game when it matters.”
Coming into the Asia Cup after a tri-nation series victory, Pakistan somewhat comfortably beat Oman and hosts United Arab Emirates, with their seven-wicket loss against India coming in between the two fixtures.
Pakistan’s Super Four stage, meanwhile, started with a six-wicket loss against Suryakumar Yadav’s men — the national side performing slightly better with the bat this time — before they went on to edge Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
The two losses seem to have given Pakistan enough information to work with as they prepare for the final — the first time the teams from the neighbouring countries meet in the Asia Cup 41-year history.
“The way we played against India in the last match was a huge step up from the first game,” Hesson noted. “In the first one, we were a bit passive and allowed India to control the game. But in the last match, we had the game by the scruff of the neck for long periods, and it took an exceptional innings from Abhishek Sharma to take it away from us.
“Outside of that, we were pretty good. It was mainly the power play with the ball. We have to be good enough to put them under pressure for longer periods. We did it for about 10 overs with the bat and after the powerplay with the ball, but we need to sustain it longer. There’s a reason they’re rated the top side in the world. That’ll be our challenge.”
And the challenge will be huge, given how Pakistan struggled with the bat against Bangladesh. They were reeling at 46-4 at the end of the powerplay before a fightback of sorts dragged them to 135-8.
Hesson admitted Pakistan were yet to “play the perfect game”.
“Look, I think whenever you get to different phases of the tournament, your opposition often doesn’t allow you to play the perfect game, and we were far from perfect,” the coach observed. “We realized that in the first 10 overs.
“… but the fact we can win games from that position just shows the character in the group. Today, whenever we tried to play aggressively, we got out before getting used to the pitch. These are lessons, and as pitches tire, discipline becomes even more important.”
Hesson, however, was wary that the final against India will have a lot to do with the players’ mindsets.
“We’ve been talking about focusing on the present and not getting ahead of ourselves,” he said. “The boys always aimed to be in this final, and we had to play good cricket to get here.
“We’ve beaten teams we hadn’t beaten in a long time, and we won the tri-series before this. There’s confidence in the group, and wins like today — when everyone writes you off 10 overs in — only build that confidence further.”

This strategy has not only failed to deliver growth; it has also entrenched inefficiencies and rent-seeking behaviour. If media reports that the proposed industrial policy seeks to revive sick industries through government support and shield select sectors are correct, the move risks perpetuating economic stagnation. The policy must be redefined with a clear statement of its goals, rationale and key components.
Pakistan must redefine its industrial policy with the aim to build a globally competitive industrial base. The rationale is simple. Previous policies distorted markets and encouraged rent-seeking, with minimal social returns. Had we maintained the export-to-GDP ratio at 16 per cent as in 1999, the total merchandise exports would have reached $56 billion in 2022 — 75pc higher than the $32bn actually realised, with no need for external borrowing, while allowing more imports. Recapturing this lost market share and becoming more competitive is the challenge.
 
 

Industrialisation must be central to our growth strategy — not just to boost exports, but to also dri­­ve innovation, create jobs and develop a skilled workforce.
This transition must be supported by robust social safety nets to protect those displaced by change. Government, the private sector and academia must work together as industrial policy has to be consistent and linked with agriculture, labour, education, trade, the exchange rate and fi­­scal and monetary policies. The government’s role should shift from interventionist to enabling. It must foster competition, ensure a level playing fi­­e­ld and resolve systemic bottlenecks. Protectio­n­i­­sm must cede to productivity. The main ingredie­n­­ts of a forward-looking industrial policy should be:
Access to finance: The government must limit its own borrowing to free up access to bank credit and capital markets for the private sector, enabling greater investment in productive activities. The Exim Bank should extend pre- and post-shipment credit as well as insurance to support new exportable products and markets. In parallel, bankruptcy and foreclosure laws need to be streamlined to ensure efficient financial discipline and risk management.
Innovation: Rapid technological change lies at the core of today’s competitive landscape, where innovation and productivity growth are closely intertwined. In Pakistan, however, R&D spending has fallen from 0.6pc of GDP in the early 2000s to just 0.28pc today. Greater support for scientific R&D across the public and private sectors is critical to reshaping production structures and processes in line with shifting demand, consumer preferences and technological advances. A comprehensive R&D strategy should prioritise stro­nger academia-industry linkages, patent development, adoption of green technologies and clean energy, steps to address climate change risks and integration of emerging technologies such as AI, robotics, and data analytics. Establishing an ‘In­­no­vation Development Challenge Fund’ could serve as a powerful instrument to drive this agenda.

We must redefine our industrial policy to build a globally competitive industrial base.

Global standards and compliance: Global standards on environmental sustainability, governance, human rights and social responsibility are becoming the norm in advanced markets. To remain competitive, Pakistan must ensure compliance with the EU’s Digital Product Passport, Eco Design Regulations and product traceability requirements.
Supporting institutions: SEZs, EPZs, technology parks and incubation centres can provide land on lease to foster clusters that promote the exchange of knowledge and skill and provide shared services, leading to agglomeration economies. These clusters would also house quality testing labs, standards compliance metrics and extension services for SME suppliers and vendors. Joint ventures between Pakistani and foreign companies to develop niche products for the global value chain could further accelerate technological upgrades, capability building and discovery of new markets. Also, foreign investors prefer arbitration for dispute resolution and contract enforcement, ensuring smoother business operations.
Deregulation, tariffs & taxation: Around two-thirds of taxes in Pakistan are collected from the manufacturing sector, which contributes only 13pc to GDP. The maze of laws, regulations and NOCs required has hindered the entry of new businesses, stifling competition. Simplifying the regulatory framework and reducing the tax burden on manufacturing would help firms to scale up and encourage new businesses to invest. Removing taxes on inter-corporate dividends would also boost investment. Neutralising the anti-export bias by lowering import duties on intermediate and final consumer goods would be beneficial too. High import duties act as a tax on exports, making domestic markets more profitable at the expense of international competitiveness.
Human capital formation & skilled labour force: A major constraint on productivity growth is the shortage of skilled workers. Technical and vocational training institutes should be scaled up and operated primarily by the private sector, while universities must focus on producing STEM graduates with market-relevant skills. Science and math should be introduced early in the school curriculum and be compulsory at the middle and secondary levels. In manufacturing, value addition depends on research, design, engineering, marketing and networking, while the digital economy needs a large pool of ICT professionals to sustain growth.
Energy pricing: Our persistent energy crisis and high end-user costs have undermined industrial growth and export diversification. To address this, private firms, selected through a transparent, competitive process, should be brought into electricity and gas distribution at the retail level. Large consumers should be allowed to contract directly with power and gas producers, with transmission companies charging fair wheeling fees for use of their network.
Labour laws: Despite having over 70 labour laws, contract, casual, temporary and daily wage employment is standard in our manufacturing sector, discouraging firms from expanding and limiting growth potential. Meanwhile, formal wage employment has stagnated, leading to low-skill levels and limited education among workers. On-the-job training is almost non-existent, and women — well-suited to certain dexterous roles — are often excluded. Hence, wages fall below livable standards and labour productivity lags behind that in peer countries. Only 7pc of firms here offer formal training to employees; those that do see significantly higher productivity levels.
What will be the result of such a redefined policy? If implemented diligently and monitored regularly, it will catalyse the rise of industries that export, save foreign exchange, attract FDI, generate jobs, and build strong supply chains. Pakistan can and must transition towards medium-tech manufacturing with global relevance. It’s not just an economic imperative, but also a national one.

Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail-led subcommittee met on Friday with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq H. Naek from the treasury benches and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar from the opposition in attendance.
The JCP subcommittee decided to consolidate and circulate each suggestion among all members for discussion at the next meeting, scheduled for the coming week and postponed proceedings, with an understanding to thoroughly discuss draft suggestions on framing benchmarks to assess judicial performance of sitting judges of the high courts.
One of the proposals was to consider the time period within which a judgement is delivered after it has been reserved by a high court judge, since inordinate delays ultimately frustrate litigants.

Members put forward suggestions, to be consolidated for discussion next week

The committee also suggested making it obligatory for high court judges to pronounce judgements within three months, as held in 2015 Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd case by a three-judge Supreme Court bench.
Presided over by Justice Saqib Nisar, the apex court in its ruling had held that a reasonable time for the pronouncement of judgements should be 90 days, since the enunciation of law requires considerable research, reflection and deliberation.
Ninety days, it noted, should be adequate for composition of judgements. If judges are unable to deliver judgements within this time period, they must record sufficient reasons and may order the case to be reheard.
Number of cases
Another proposal under consideration was for the JCP to evaluate how many cases a judge decides in a month, and whether those decisions involve substantive matters that advance jurisprudence or merely routine bail matters.
The proposals also included assessing whether a judge exhausts the entire cause list for the day or merely hears a few cases and adjourns the rest.
However, questions remain about how benchmarks will account for cases withdrawn after judges point out jurisdictional flaws. A legal expert, noted that such withdrawals save judicial time by avoiding unnecessary appeals, yet they are never reported in law digests. “Should a judge be penalised for thoroughly understanding the case and prompting withdrawal?” the expert asked.
The expert further explained that performance cannot simply be measured by the number of cases heard in a day, as much depends on the type of cases assigned by the chief justice. For example, civil revision cases are time-consuming and complex, whereas other categories may involve issuing directions to departments and can be decided more quickly. Comparing judges across such different case types would be unfair, he argued.
 
 

On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee on judicial performance evaluation of high court judges. The committee, comprising members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and legal fraternity, was tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations and developing criteria for the selection of judges.
The 26th Amendment to Article 175A allows the JCP to give underperforming high court judges time to improve, and if they fail, recommend their removal to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
And after the completion of the period so granted, the performance of the judge is again found to be inefficient; the commission will send its report to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with a recommendation to remove the judge.
Moreover, the commission will hold annual evaluations of high court judges and may set rules to define performance standards.

Justice Raheel Kamran, delivering a detailed 20-page judgement, observed that the ordinance was enacted in a pre-digital era to regulate films exhibited through cinematographs in cinemas and other public venues, and was not designed for online streaming services.
The petitioners, including NC Entertainment (Pvt) Ltd, had argued that requiring cinemas to obtain film certification while leaving digital platforms unregulated was discriminatory and infringed their fundamental rights.
They contended that censorship principles under Section 6 of the Ordinance, derived from Article 19 of the Constitution, should apply equally across all platforms to uphold social norms of decency and morality.

Says extending Motion Pictures Ordinance to streaming services will be ‘judicial legislation’

The counsel argued that provisions of the ordinance had not been enforced equally against all mediums and platforms of public and private exhibition and the same were being applied selectively and arbitrarily against the petitioners, leaving all other digital platforms to continue unchecked.
A law officer for the federal government opposed the writ petitions as not maintainable.
He said the petitioners were not aggrieved and none of their established rights had been restricted or hindered by any of the respondents.
He maintained that following the 18th constitutional amendment, the subject of cinematograph censorship devolved upon the provinces, granting them exclusive authority in this regard.
He contended that the term “cinematograph” shall be construed keeping in view the context of the ordinance and OTT platforms were not covered by it.
A law officer for the Punjab government stated that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) exclusively deals with electronic media and that the jurisdiction of the Punjab Film Censor Board was only restricted to the censorship of films.
He also emphasised that the term “cinematograph” was to be construed in the context of the ordinance, which had no application to the OTT platforms.
A lawyer for Pemra argued that the body was a regulatory authority for the broadcasting media and distribution of services and it was responsible only for improving the quality standards of the channels shown to the people of Pakistan.
He contended that Pemra had no nexus with the motion picture law and the petitioners. He also questioned the locus standi of the petitioners.
A counsel for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) also stated that it had no mandate or jurisdiction to regulate matters pertaining to content that was available for viewership on OTT platforms.
Advocate Zeeshan Zafar Hashmi, an amicus curiae (an impartial adviser to a court of law), also stated that the ordinance essentially deals with the exhibition of films by means of cinematograph, which is controlled by the Censor Board through censorship.
Justice Kamran observed that OTT platforms, which operate globally and deliver content directly to users on personal devices, fall outside the framework of the ordinance.
The judge noted that pre-censorship of OTT platforms was not only legally untenable but also logistically impossible given the vast, continuously updated nature of digital content.
 
 

Justice Kamran ruled that extending the motion pictures ordinance to cover OTT platforms would amount to judicial legislation, which is beyond the court’s domain.
The judge observed that cinemas and OTT platforms are fundamentally distinct and therefore not “similarly circumstanced” entities under Article 25 of the Constitution.
The judge also dismissed the petitioners’ contention that importing digital content is exempt from the Import Policy Order 2022, holding that once content is exhibited publicly in Pakistan, it must comply with domestic laws governing public exhibition.
Justice Kamran then dismissed the petitions, declaring that they were not maintainable on legal or practical grounds.

• FBR analysis points to widespread reluctance in voluntary asset valuation
ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic U-turn, the government on Friday scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
The lightning-fast reversal, prompted by criticism from tax practitioners, lawyers and other groups, has reignited debate over policy consistency and digital reforms aimed at documenting the cash economy.
The income tax return form for 2025, released on July 7, had required taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form. Since then, taxpayers had been submitting returns with the flexibility to either declare the estimated market value of their assets or enter zero in the designated column.
This practice continued even as nearly 2.7 million taxpayers filed their returns under the same arrangement. However, internal analysis by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) revealed a widespread reluctance to voluntarily declare market values.
In response, the FBR introduced a technical adjustment to the system, eliminating the option to enter zero and effectively making it mandatory for all filers to disclose a fair estimate of their asset values. This move triggered strong resistance from multiple quarters, highlighting persistent reluctance to support the formal documentation of the country’s largely cash-driven economy.
On Thursday, the FBR issued a strongly worded clarification, urging taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets in good faith. It assured filers that such disclosures would not be used as grounds for additional taxation and that no supplementary documentation would be required for verification, nor would tax notices be issued solely on the basis of declared asset values.
Despite these assurances, the controversy persisted. In response, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
 
 

The committee was tas­ked with evaluating the implications of the provision for taxpayers and recommending corrective measures to ensure clarity, fairness and administrative feasibility.
On Friday, the committee held consultations with top tax officers to assess the legal aspect of the column.
“The requirement to declare the true market value of assets is firmly embedded in the income tax law,” a senior tax official said, adding that many taxpayers were reluctant to disclose the actual value of their assets, reflecting broader resistance to financial transparency.
Following deliberations, the committee decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister, an FBR announcement said.
The committee included the federal minister for petroleum, the minister of state for finance, the attorney general for Pakistan, the special assistant to the prime minister on coordination, the finance secretary, the FBR chairman and its member customs.
After detailed discussions in its meeting on Friday, the committee recommended that the new column requiring taxpayers to declare estimated fair market values of their assets be withdrawn in the interest of simplifying the filing process.
The recommendation was submitted to the prime minister, who approved it.
According to the statement, in line with the premier’s directives and considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, the “Estimated Fair Market Value” column has been removed from the income tax return form.
It clarified that the column had been introduced solely for data collection to support the Economic Survey and had no bearing on the assessment of income or tax liability.
The FBR reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating taxpayers and urged all eligible individuals to file their returns accurately and in good faith before the Sept 30, 2025, deadline.

UN rights chief Volker Turk has condemned as a war crime Israel’s policy of settlements on Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank.
Big firms such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Motorola Solutions and Trip Advisor remained on the list, while several others were removed, the non-exhaustive database showed.
Most of the companies were based in Israel, while others were based in the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Germany, China, Luxe­mbourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. 

Sixty-eight new companies added to the 2023 list

The UN rights office report called on companies to “take appropriate action to address the adverse human rights impacts” of their activities. “Where business enterprises identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in remediation through appropriate processes,” it stressed.
Turk said in a statement: “This report underscores the due diligence responsibility of businesses working in contexts of conflict to ensure their activities do not contribute to human rights abuses.” 
The list was first produced by the UN human rights office in 2020 amid harsh Israeli criticism. It came in response to a UN Human Rights Council resolution four years earlier demanding a database of firms that profited from business in illegally occupied Palestinian territory.
The UN rights office was asked to list firms found to be taking part in any of 10 specific activities, including construction, surveillance, demolitions and destruction of agricultural land in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
It has stressed that listing companies in the database was “not, and does not purport to be, a judicial or quasi-judicial process”.
“A total of 68 new companies were added to the list published in 2023, while seven of those... were removed as they were no longer involved in any of the activities concerned,” the rights office said. The list is not exhaustive, the rights office said, acknowledging that it had only had time to review 215 of the 596 companies about which it received submissions.

According to a press release, WiFi 7 and future generations will operate on the 6 GHz network band, underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to digital innovation and leadership.
“Wi-Fi 7 delivers ultra-high data rates, low latency, and robust reliability, enabling 8K streaming, AR/VR, and industrial automation,” the press release read.
“By easing congestion in legacy bands and reducing broadband delivery costs, it will strengthen connectivity for households, SMEs (small-medium enterprises), campuses, healthcare, and smart cities.”
This development comes a week after Information and Technology Secretary Zarrar Hasham said that restoring damaged undersea internet cables may take four to five weeks.

In a related development, the University of Karachi (KU) issued a fresh declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of the IHC judge’s degree.
On Thursday, heated scenes were witnessed at the SHC as a two-judge bench declined to entertain the plea of the IHC judge to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it.
In its written order on Friday, the CB noted that it had “given an opportunity of hearing to all the lawyers for the petitioners on the question of maintainability” of these pleas, but they “deliberately chose not to avail this opportunity and instead walked out of [the] courtroom while causing a rumpus”.
It added that it was for the court to regulate its own proceedings and it could not be held hostage to the “whims or wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”.
The order read that Justice Jahangiri, with the permission of the bench, addressed the court with dignity and patience, but “not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, were accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left [the] courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard”.
On the objections raised by the counsel for the petitioners, the CB noted that if they had any reservations about the transfer of these pleas from one bench to another, the appropriate course was to approach the apex court, which they failed to do.
The order further read that it was up to a judge to decide if they wanted to recuse themselves from a case or not based on their conscience.
The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the University of Karachi (KU) syndicate, challenging the decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
However, the dismissal of these petitions over non-prosecution has led to the withdrawal of the earlier interim stay and restraining order.
The SHC, in its order, observed that the superior courts possessed the “inherent power to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default regulate proceedings under Articles 199 of the Constitution, a principle confirmed by the Supreme Court in PLD 1993 SC 341 and 2006 SCMR 1154, where a persistent lack of diligence justifies dismissal”.
“Therefore, this court is compelled to dismiss the petitions due to non-prosecution,” it added.
It noted that when the counsel representing the parties, along with other members of the bar, insisted that their objections be decided first, the court informed them that all matters would be heard and decided together.
The bench further noted that they began shouting slogans against the judiciary. completely disrupting the decorum of the court.
“Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession,” it added.
“Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court. However, by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices. It is expected that the concerned counsel should maintain court decorum in future.”
The CB directed the SHC registrar to immediately preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of September 25, both inside and outside of the courtroom.
KU declaration
After the dismissal of the petitions, the KU issued a new declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In August last year, the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s law degree on the recommendation of its UMC.
The decision came a few hours after the alleged detention of academic and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by the police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate had decided to cancel the degree.
In a statement issued on Thursday, KU said the syndicate, in its meeting held on August 31, 2024, had cancelled the LLB degree of IHC judge as well as his enrollment after finding him guilty of unfair means.
“In compliance with the syndicate meeting held on [August 21,2024] vide resolution No.06, the LLB results and degree of Mr Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram being seat No. 22857 and enrollment No. AIL -7124/87 is hereby withdrawn and cancelled,” it added.
It also said that the new declaration had been issued with the approval of the KU vice chancellor.</p><small>2025-09-26 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/262255072cf9a49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944803/us-tells-india-that-russian-oil-curbs-are-key-to-trade-deal-progress' target='_blank'><strong>US tells India that Russian oil curbs are key to trade deal progress</strong></a><br><p>Trade negotiators from the United States have told their Indian counterparts that curbing purchases of Russian oil is crucial to reducing India’s tariff rate and sealing a trade deal, two people familiar with the talks told Reuters.
While trade negotiations are on a positive track, a US official said, more work is needed to ensure India addresses US concerns over market access, the trade deficit and purchases of Russian oil.
US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure India, the European Union and members of Nato to curb purchases of Russian oil as a way to cut Moscow’s revenue and hasten an end to the war in Ukraine.
The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use maximum leverage to advance its policy goals, as evidenced by its linking trade negotiations with India to demands that it curb Russian oil purchases.
Trump has expressed growing frustration over the slow progress toward ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, a conflict he pledged to resolve from his first day in office.
The US has already imposed an extra 25 per cent tariff on imports from India to pressure New Delhi to halt its purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, bringing total punitive duties on Indian goods to 50pc and souring trade negotiations between the two democracies.
But Trump has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports over China’s purchases of Russian oil, as his administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.
India and China are the two largest buyers of Russian oil, which is already subject to numerous US sanctions that have constrained Moscow’s access to global markets.
In response, India has defended its oil imports, emphasising the economic benefits and accusing Western nations of hypocrisy for continuing trade with Russia despite sanctions.</p><small>2025-09-26 18:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26202053eee0b3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944785/at-unga-pm-shehbaz-says-south-asia-requires-proactive-not-provocative-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>At UNGA, PM Shehbaz says South Asia requires ‘proactive not provocative’ leadership</strong></a><br><p>As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif detailed the events of May’s four-day escalation between India and Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday, he highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia.
In May, the military confrontation between India and Pakistan had come as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
PM Shehbaz recalled the escalation at the 80th session of the UNGA today, where he led Pakistan’s delegation.
He began his address with these words: “Our world is more complex today than ever before. Conflicts are intensifying, international law is being brazenly violated, humanitarian crises are multiplying, terrorism remains a potent threat, disinformation and fake news undermine trust, climate change threatens our very survival, and more so for countries like Pakistan.”
He added that today, multilateralism was no more an option but the need of the hour.
PM Shehbaz then explained that Pakistan’s foreign policy was based on peace, mutual respect and cooperation.
“We believe in the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy,” he asserted.
The premier recalled that last year, from this very podium, “I had warned that Pakistan would act most decisively against any external aggression”.
 
  @dawn.today Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, delivering his keynote address at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, recalled that from the same podium last year he had warned Pakistan would respond decisively to any external aggression. “Those words proved true. In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation,” he said.

“Those words of mine proved true … In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. Our enemy came shrouded in arrogance, [and] we sent them back in humiliation.
“India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and our national security were violated, our response was in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
He hailed Pakistan’s armed forces and the military leadership, saying: “Our valiant armed forces, under the stellar leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir mounted an operation of stunning professionalism, bravey and acumen. Repelling the enemy’s attack under Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, our falcons took flight and etched their answer across the skies, resulting in seven of the Indian jets being turned to scrap and dust.”
As the premier commended the Pakistani forces and people for their resolve during the escalation with India, slogans of “Pakistan Zindabad” (long live Pakistan) and “Shehbaz Sharif Zindabad” (long live Shehbaz Sharif) were heard in the UNGA hall.
The prime minister Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire following a four-day escalation with India in May from a position of strength. He also expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump and his tams for “their active role” in bringing about the ceasefire.
“President Trump’s efforts for peace helped avert a … war in South Asia. Had he not intervened timely and decisively, the consequences of a full-fledged war would have been catastrophic,” PM Shehbaz said. “Therefore, in recognition of President Trump’s wonderful and outstanding contribution to promote peace in our part of the world, Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is the least we could do … I think he truly is a man of peace.”
He also thanked Pakistan’s “friends and partners”, including China, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the UN secretary general for extending diplomatic support to Pakistan during the escalation in May.
“We have won the war, and now we seek to win peace in our part of the world. This is my most sincere serious offer before this august assembly of the world nations. Pakistan stands ready for a composite, comprehensive and result-oriented dialogue with India on all outstanding issues,” he said.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that South Asia required “proactive rather than provocative leadership”.
The “unilateral and illegal attempt to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance defies the provisions of the treaty itself, as well as the norms of international law itself,” he said, adding that Pakistan had made it abundantly clear that “we will definitely and ardently defend the … right of our 240m people on these waters”.
He expressed solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir, saying that one day, India’s tyranny in the valley would come to a grinding halt.
“Kashmir will gain its fundamental right to self-determination through an impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations,” he said.
‘Heart wrenching’
Turning his attention toward Gaza, he said the plight of the Palestinian people was one of the “most heart-wrenching tragedies of our time”.
“This prolonged injustice is a stain on the global conscious and our collective moral failure. For nearly 80 years, the Palestinians have courageously endured Israel’s brutal occupation of their homeland. In the West Bank, each passing day brings new brutality,” he grieved.
In Gaza, he said, Israel’s genocidal onslaught had unleashed unspeakable terror upon women and children in a manner that had not been witnessed in the annals of history.
“In [the] blind pursuit of its nefarious goals, the Israeli leadership has unleashed a shameful campaign against the innocent Palestinians, which history will remember as one of its darkest chapters,” he added.
Emphasising the need to raise voice over the atrocities in Gaza, he said, “We must speak, and speak loud and clear.”
He added, “Our words are too little and too late for Hind Rajab. A child, nay a little baby … My agony and the agony of the entire Muslim ummah, and the agony of all the nations on this planet, is that we failed Hind Rajab. And she will not forgive us.”

The PM continued, “The smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry. I would know, as I carried the coffin of Irtaza Abbas during the recent confrontation with India. He was only six years old. Therefore, we cannot and must not fail these children of Gaza, or any child anywhere in the world. We must find a path to a ceasefire now.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a sovereign Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders and Jerusalem as its capital.
“Palestine can no no longer remain under Israeli shackles, it must be liberated and liberated with full commitment and full force.”
He also welcomed the recognition of the State of Palestine by several countries recently and urged others to follow suit.
Referring to a meeting of Trump with the leaders of some Muslim countries earlier this week, he appreciated the US president’s “timely initiative” to call the moot on Gaza.
“I was also a part of that consultative process and I … pray to God that it rekindles hope for a ceasefire in the nearest future,” PM Shehbaz said.
He went on to criticise Israel for its recent attack on Doha that targetted Hamas leaders. Condemning the strike, he expressed solidarity with Qatar.
The premier also expressed support for efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict in line with the UN Charter,  “to end human suffering and global turmoil cause by this protracted war”.
‘Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism’
Speaking about terrorism, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations.
For two decades, Pakistan had been on the frontline of global counter-terrorism efforts, he highlighted, asking, “What can be a bigger  manifestation of our commitment to fight terrorism and erase it, not only from the face of Pakistan but from the face of this global world?”
He asserted that unless terrorism was defeated hands down, this world would not be a peaceful place to live. “For that, Pakistan’s sacrifices are probably the biggest around the globe. It must be respected and appreciated, because we’re a bulwark,” he continued. “Had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming the streets of New York, London and God knows, the Far East.”
The premier said Pakistan was today facing the problem of externally sponsored terrorism, particularly from foreign funded groups that were operating from the Afghan soil.
He stressed that Pakistan “has a direct stake in a peaceful Afghanistan”.
“We believe that the key to development and prosperity lies in regional stability and connectivity. Pakistan continues to engage with all partners to extend humanitarian assistance, promote economic recovery and encourage an inclusive political framework in Afghanistan,” he said.
But, he went on to say, “the interim Afghan government must uphold human rights, including women’s rights. Above all, we expect the interim government to take effective action against terrorist groups and to ensure that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against any country”.
Dangers of Islamophobia
The prime minister further underlined that “there must be no space for hate speech, discrimination or violence against any person, or against any religion”.
“Hate-driven ideologies, like Hindutva-driven extremism in India, pose a danger to the entire world. While there is growing recognition of the dangers posed by Islamophobia, the imperative of effectively combatting this menace can hardly be over emphasised,” he asserted.
The premier said Pakistan welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy to combat this scourge.
‘Urgent collective action’
On the climate crisis, he said Pakistan demands “urgent collective action”.
Speaking of the recent floods in the country, he said: “Our nation stands united in these testing times. We are dealing with this natural calamity with remarkable resilience … I have declared a climate emergency to cope with this challenge.”
He termed the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025  in Pakistan “glaring examples of loss and damage caused due to climate change”.
The premier also pointed out that Pakistan’s contribution to emissions annually was less than one per cent. “Yet, it continues to face the relentless brunt and muddy waves of climate change, and then we are told to take loans and add to our debt,” he rued.
“This is not fairness, this is not equality, this is not justice, this is not fair play,” he asserted. “I think borrowing loans would be [akin to] destroying our economy. We would be better off … standing on our own feet, working hard and tirelessly.”
He concluded his speech, saying: “At the end, let me assure you [that] Pakistan will always stand for peace, justice and development for a revitalised UN and cooperative multilateralism that is fair, inclusive and delivers for all.
“Let this 80th anniversary [of the UN] not simply commemorate history. Let’s make history and chart a future for the next 80 years with these united nations as an enduring hope for global good. Let us truly strive to become better together.”</p><small>2025-09-26 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26204846e2653cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944798/tehran-moscow-sign-25bn-deal-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-iran-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Tehran, Moscow sign $25bn deal to build nuclear plants in Iran: state media</strong></a><br><p>Iran and Russia signed a $25 billion deal to build nuclear power plants in the Islamic republic, Iranian state media reported on Friday, just hours ahead of the likely return of sweeping UN sanctions on Iran.
“A deal for the construction of four nuclear power plants with a value of $25 billion in Sirik, Hormozgan was signed between the Iran Hormoz company and Rosatom,” state television said.
Iran has just one operational nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south, with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts — just a fraction of the country’s energy needs.
According to state news agency IRNA, each plant will have a capacity of 1,255 megawatts, though no details were provided on the timeline.
The move comes as so-called snapback sanctions triggered by the European parties to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran are set to return by the end of Saturday.
Britain, France and Germany triggered the sanctions last month, accusing of Iran of failing to adhere to its commitments under the agreement.
At a Security Council session on Friday, China and Russia put forward a draft resolution to allow another half year for talks, but it is unlikely to garner enough support to pass.
Western countries have long accused Iran of seeking an atomic bomb — a charge Tehran vehemently denies, defending its right to a civilian nuclear programme.
The United States in 2018 unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear accord with Iran, prompting Tehran to begin walking back its commitments.
Talks between Washington and Tehran to strike a new deal were underway, before being derailed by unprecedented Israeli strikes on Iran in June that began a 12-day war briefly joined by the United States.
Iran had previously signed with Russia a nuclear energy deal in 1993 allowing for the construction of the Bushehr plant, after Germany had abandoned it in the wake of the Islamic revolution of 1979.</p><small>2025-09-26 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2620210163fc999.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944786/asia-cup-haris-fined-farhan-given-warning-for-gestures-during-super-four-match-against-india-report-says' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Haris fined, Farhan given warning for gestures during Super Four match against India, report says</strong></a><br><p>Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were on Friday reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported.
According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson.
“Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.”
Earlier, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military skirmish between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported.
“It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
“The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added.
Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
With that win, the Green Shirts bookëd their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-26 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2618060712f6867.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944771/trump-signs-order-declaring-tiktok-sale-ready-and-values-it-at-14bn' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order declaring TikTok sale ready and values it at $14bn</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday declaring that his plan to sell Chinese-owned TikTok’s US operations to US and global investors will address the national security requirements in a 2024 law.
The new US company will be valued at around $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance said, putting a price tag on the popular short video app far below some analyst estimates.
Trump on Thursday delayed until January 20 enforcement of the law that bans the app unless its Chinese owners sell it amid efforts to extract TikTok’s US assets from the global platform, line up American and other investors, and win approval from the Chinese government.
The publication of the executive order shows Trump is making progress on the sale of TikTok’s US assets, but numerous details need to be fleshed out, including how the US entity would use TikTok’s most important asset, its recommendation algorithm.
“There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans’ data privacy as required by law,” Vance told reporters at an Oval Office briefing.
Trump’s order says the algorithm will be retrained and monitored by the US company’s security partners, and operation of the algorithm will be under the control of the new joint venture.
Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping had indicated approval of the plans. “I spoke with President Xi,” Trump said. “We had a good talk, I told him what we were doing and he said go ahead with it.”
China’s foreign ministry on Friday reiterated that the government “respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules to reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balance of interests”.
“We hope the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a press conference, without giving further details of the deal.
TikTok did not immediately comment on Trump’s action.
Trump has credited TikTok, which has 170 million US users, with helping him win reelection last year. Trump has 15 million followers on his personal TikTok account. The White House also launched an official TikTok account last month.
“This is going to be American-operated all the way,” Trump said.
He said that Michael Dell, the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies; Rupert Murdoch, the chairman emeritus of Fox News owner Fox Corp and newspaper publisher News Corp, and “probably four or five absolutely world-class investors” would be part of the deal.
The White House did not discuss how it came up with the $14 billion valuation.
TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, currently values itself at more than $330 billion, according to its new employee share buyback plan. TikTok contributes a small percentage of the company’s total revenue.
According to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, TikTok was estimated to be worth $30 billion to $40bn without the algorithm as of April 2025.
Alan Rozenshtein, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the executive order left unanswered questions, including whether ByteDance would still control the algorithm.
“The problem is that the president has certified the deal, but he has not provided a lot of information on the algorithm,” he said.
Chinese media on Friday also painted a different picture of the TikTok agreement, suggesting ByteDance would continue to play a major or operational role.
ByteDance will set up a new US company as part of the restructuring of TikTok’s US operations, Chinese media outlet LatePost reported, citing sources.
The new company to be set up by ByteDance will be responsible for e-commerce, branding operations and interconnection with international operations, the report said.
The report also said the joint venture, as described by the White House and valued at $14 billion, would be responsible for US digital security, safeguarding content and software as well as related local businesses.
Another Chinese financial magazine, Caixin, also reported, citing people close to the deal, that ByteDance planned to set up a TikTok US entity that will receive some revenue from the new TikTok joint venture.
Both reports were taken down from their respective websites later on Friday.
The White House and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oracle and others to own TikTok in the US
A group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50 per cent stake in TikTok US, two sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday.
A group of existing shareholders in ByteDance will hold a roughly 30pc stake, one of the sources said. Among ByteDance’s current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR.
Given intense investor interest in TikTok, the 50pc stake may still shift, the source noted.
Oracle and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CNBC reported earlier, citing sources, that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok US with a combined 45pc ownership.
MGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report.
Republican House of Representatives lawmakers said they wanted to see more details of the deal to ensure it represented a clean break with China.
“As the details are finalised, we must ensure this deal protects American users from the influence and surveillance of CCP-aligned groups,” said US Representatives Brett Guthrie, Gus Bilirakis and Richard Hudson.
The agreement on TikTok’s US operations includes the appointment by ByteDance of one of seven board members for the new entity, with Americans holding the other six seats, a senior White House official said on Saturday.
ByteDance would hold less than 20pc in TikTok US to comply with requirements set out in the 2024 law that ordered it shut down by January 2025 if ByteDance did not sell its US assets.</p><small>2025-09-26 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2617482188f10c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944770/indian-police-detain-activist-after-deadly-ladakh-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police detain activist after deadly Ladakh protests</strong></a><br><p>Indian police on Friday detained prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk over violent protests in the Himalayan territory of Ladakh that left at least five people dead, a lawyer said.
Demonstrations demanding greater political autonomy for the sparsely populated, high-altitude region bordering China and Pakistan turned deadly on Wednesday when security forces opened fire.
New Delhi blamed the unrest on “provocative speeches” by Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment.
Mustafa Haji, a lawyer for the Apex Body Leh — which is spearheading the protests — told AFP that Wangchuk was “picked up” by the police from his village of Uley Tokpo on Friday.
“Charges against him are not known yet,” Haji said.
An engineer by training, Wangchuk, 59, is best known for pioneering water conservation projects in the Himalayas.
He received the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2018 for his environmental work and contributions to reforming local schooling in Ladakh.
His life and work are said to have inspired a character played by Bollywood star Aamir Khan in the hugely popular movie Three Idiots.
Wangchuk, who is a vocal advocate for Ladakh’s environmental protection and tribal rights, was briefly detained by Delhi Police last year during a protest march. Indian authorities on Thursday cancelled his non-profit organisation’s foreign funding licence.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said today that it is monitoring the situation.
“The developments that unfolded in Leh, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, are extremely disturbing,” the FO told Dawn.com. They demonstrate the Indian authorities’ willingness to go to any extent to curb a protest. They are also another manifestation of India’s iron-fisted approach in that occupied territory.“
Modi’s government split Ladakh off from occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both.
New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies.
India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.

Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
On Sept 15, Mazari approached an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), filing a complaint under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
As Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz took cognisance of Mazari’s complaint, the IHC  administration stripped the judge of her powers to entertain harassment complaints. Instead, IHC’s Justice  Inaam Ameen Minhas was appointed as the competent authority to oversee the case. This prompted Mazari to approach the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar’s shunting of a female judge for taking up a harassment complaint against him.
In today’s letter, addressed to Justice Minhas — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — Mazari said that the competent authority under the act was “required to communicate the charges to the accused within three days of receipt of the complaint, and the accused was required to submit a written defense within seven days from when the charge was communicated to him”.
“I am unaware of the status of my complaint, as I have not been informed by the competent authority in this regard,” she wrote.
Mazari called for a “clear urgency” to address the matter, saying, “I request redressal of my grievances at the earliest.”
She also brought up the matter of Justice Imtiaz’s removal as the competent authority and the appointment of Justice Minhas as a replacement, saying the move was “unlawful” as the “accused cannot alter the competent authority or impede my complaint by abusing his position of authority”.
She also highlighted “continuing acts of reprisal” by CJ Dogar following the complaint. “As you must be aware, such reprisals are strictly prohibited under the 2010 Act, and as competent authority, you are required to ensure that I am not subjected to such reprisals,” she said.
According to the letter, on Sept 16, Mazari’s client Mahrang Baloch’s case was fixed for a hearing before him, and Mazari’s proxy counsel requested a transfer of the case to any other bench due to the pending complaint.
“The accused refused to transfer the case, requiring me to appear before him despite the fact that under the law, no woman subjected to such treatment would be required to be in the presence of her alleged harasser,” she wrote.
“The aforementioned facts and circumstances clearly depict the brazen abuse of authority by the accused to shield himself from inquiry in my complaint,” she noted.
Mazari further said that her application seeking preservation of CCTV footage from the day of the incident remained “unanswered”, requesting “immediate intervention in securing this crucial evidence”.
Mazari had submitted an application to the IHC’s registrar for the preservation of CCTV footage of the “unfortunate incident” that took place with her.
In the application, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”</p><small>2025-09-26 09:22</small></div><hr>
