The development comes as a session of the KP Assembly was summoned for 10 am with the election of the chief minister on the agenda. The session has not yet begun.
In a post on social media platform X late night on Sunday, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”.
He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”.
 






“Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said.
Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
 






Resignation row
On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role.
The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it.
On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added.
A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others.
PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms.
Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.
4 candidates in race for next CM
On Sunday, four candidates filed their nomination papers with the speaker of the provincial assembly for the election of the new chief minister scheduled for today.
Those who submitted nomination papers included PTI’s chief minister-designate Sohail Afridi, while Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP represented the opposition parties in the KP Assembly.
KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati approved all the nomination papers after scrutiny.
A candidate needs to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the CM election.
After filing his nomination papers, PTI’s nominee Sohail Afridi told reporters that democracy should prevail and that the Cons­titution provided a clear and smooth process for the election of the leader of the house. “No one should interfere in the process of electing the new chief minister,” he said.
Speaking to reporters at the assembly premises, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah expressed astonishment over the situation, saying, “How can there be two chief ministers in Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa? The resignation tendered by the incumbent chief minister has not yet been approved by the governor, while PTI is proceeding to elect another chief minister.”
He added that a strange situation had emerged as the incumbent chief minister had not officially left office, the provincial cabinet was still intact, and yet an election was being held for another chief minister. “We are dealing with politically inexperienced people,” Dr Ibadullah remarked.
JUI-F parliamentary leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman said that PTI was holding the election for the leader of the house in haste.
“The governor can still return the resignation since it has not been approved yet,” he said, adding that he might be the joint candidate of the opposition alliance. He maintained that the governor was the constitutional head of the province and that PTI should have waited for formal approval of the resignation before proceeding. “It is inappropriate to hold an election for chief minister while the incumbent is still in office,” he said.
When asked whether the opposition intended to challenge today’s election in court, he said that anyone could approach the court to contest any unconstitutional act.
PTI KP Deputy Secretary Information Ikram Khatana also told Dawn that a delegation of the party leaders, led by its provincial president MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, visited the residences of JUI-F, ANP and PML-N leaders to seek their support for electing Sohail Afridi unopposed.
“The PTI also urged opposition leaders not to support any unconstitutional or illegal moves by invisible forces seeking to create hurdles in the election of the chief minister,” he said. According to Khatana, the ANP leadership assured PTI that it would not be part of any horse-trading or monetary influence in the election, while the PML-N and JUI-F leaders said they would convey PTI’s message to their central leadership.</p><small>2025-10-13 05:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/130828501e5c5d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948566/im-good-at-making-peace-trump-turns-attention-to-border-skirmishes-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘I’m good at making peace’: Trump turns attention to border skirmishes between Pakistan and Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Monday appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan after border skirmishes between the two countries over the weekend, saying he was “good at making peace”.
Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
The US president, since returning to the White House for his second term in January, had repeatedly insisted in the run up to the Nobel peace prize that he deserved the award for his role in resolving eight conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
The US president touched on the border hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan while speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. Tel Aviv and Hamas are set to carry out a hostage-prisoner exchange as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan proposed by Trump.
 


During the interaction with the media, a reporter stated that the US president was receiving credit from Democrats and Republicans for securing the peace deal in Gaza.
“Where do you think it fits into your legacy?” the reporter asked.
“This will be my eighth war that I’ve solved. And I hear now there’s a war going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back’. I am doing another one’. Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace and it is an honour to do it. I save millions of lives,” he said.
Commenting on the Nobel peace prize being awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, he said: “In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024 … But there are those that say you could make an exception cause a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and completed and great.
“But I did this not for Nobel, I did this for saving lives,” he said.
“Think about India-Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31 [years], one going for 32 [years] and one going for 37 years. And I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good,” he said.
He went on to say that he had settled “a few of the wars just based on tariffs”.
“With India and Pakistan, I said if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I’m going to put big tariffs on you both; like a 100 per cent, a 150pc and 200pc … I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs you could have never settled that war,” he said.
Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.

Sources said the chimp had been under treatment for months.
Speaking to Dawn, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official Daniyal Sial confirmed her death, saying that “senility” had been declared the cause of death in her post-mortem report.
“Bibi has been under treatment for a long time for multiple health complications, mainly resulting from old age,” he said, adding that she was around 40 years old.
According to the KMC sources, Bibi was handed over to the zoo after being caught by the police in an operation
Bibi was captured after she and her mate had escaped from a PECHS house in 2000; the male chimp was killed in police operation in the year 2000. She, along with her mate, had escaped from a house in the PECHS area where they had been kept illegally as “pets”.
“The male chimp had to be killed when it had grabbed a police official while Bibi was captured and brought to the zoo where she was later paired with another male chimpanzee. He died three years’ later due to malignant growth on his ear,” explained an official, adding that the zoo is now left with only one surviving female chimp.
Chimpanzees are listed as endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They have already disappeared completely from four countries and are under tremendous pressure everywhere else they live, mainly due to illegal wildlife trade and habitat destruction.
 
 

Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulations and laws, chimpanzees are classified as an Appendix I species, completely banning the trade in chimps and parts, except in rare cases such as scientific research.
“In compliance to the international law, we have the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Flora and Fauna Act 2012, strictly monitoring all movements concerning wildlife,” said Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar.
He pointed out that the Rule 86/Sub-rule 7 of the Sindh Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Rules 2022 didn’t allow import of primates.
“The primates kept in the zoo were among the species once brought to the country under shady deals, prior to the enactment of these laws. Now, there is strict surveillance at the international, national and provincial levels over trans-boundary movement of wildlife species,” he said, adding that these laws banned trade of all wildly caught species.

The best author would struggle to coin such a neat ending for the story of the demise of democracy. The prize, after all, implies how exceptional the fight for democratic norms has become in this century. Such a bleak reading of María Corina Machado’s victory may seem counter-intuitive given the flurry in recent months of protest activity around the world.
According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Global Protest Tracker, there have been more than 142 significant anti-government protests over the past 12 months affecting over 68 countries. Analysis by Allianz shows that 18 per cent of these have lasted more than three months.
Peaceful protests have long been considered synonymous with healthy democracy. Research published by Harvard’s Erica Chenoweth in 2019 showed that non-violent protests are twice as likely to succeed in achieving their aims as armed conflict, and that protest movements that reached the ‘tipping point’ of engaging 3.5pc of the population always succeeded.
Against this backdrop, the proliferation of protests should give us solace that civil society is alive and well, and that the routine exercise of the democratic right to peaceful protest indicates that the political system is in less jeopardy than signalled. In recent weeks alone, protests have erupted in Nepal, Madagascar, the US, UK, Italy, Israel, and, closer to home, AJK — as well as Punjab thanks to the TLP. Going by protest volume alone, one could conclude that Machado’s prize is an affirmation of good practice, rather than a callout for exceptional resilience.
But as Pakistanis, we know better. Many protests in our country are feats of democratic participation, organised with integrity and courage — often against all odds — to demand justice, accountability or inclusion (consider women’s and Baloch rights marches). Sadly, some protests are part of a cynical political ploy, engineered by the powers that be and staged by proxies.
They may be unleashed for various reasons: to put pressure on different institutions within our hybrid power structure; to establish the national narrative on sensitive issues; or to offer a release valve for strong emotions when realpolitik requires the state to make strategic decisions that counter public sentiment. In other words, protests are often a ploy to consolidate authoritarian control.

What can be done to save protests?

This knowledge nuances perceptions of the protest activity in other countries, and highlights how protests are interlinked with authoritarian tendencies as much as they are with democratic freedoms. Two trends are evident. Firstly, protests seem to erupt as a last resort, the fallback option when authoritarian approaches are so entrenched that all other political or legislative means to achieving just ends seem ineffective. Such protests are better understood as political barometers for authoritarian overreach; the protest as a dying gasp rather than the birth of something new.
Alternatively, in neoliberal contexts — think the US or Europe — where democratic norms are limping along, protests are triggering fresh authoritarian measures, including clampdowns on protest activity and digital rights, the outlawing of contrarian voices on national security grounds, increased powers of detention, media censorship and citizen surveillance. These protests point to creeping authoritarianism.
Many global protests are dominated by young people, who turn to the streets in lieu of other forms of political engagement. This signals the extent to which traditional paths to political activism have been denuded, particularly with the erosion of youth wings of parties, the stifling of campus politics, and the flagging appeal of in-person political campaigning in the face of TikTok activism.
But this also explains why protests are likely to become less effective even as they are more frequent. Rather than signs of democratic debate, they will draw attention to gaps in authoritarian control, reinforcing rather than undermining the latter. Lacking institutional affiliation, organisational capacity and momentum, protest movements often fizzle out, leaving resentments stirred but not addressed or channelled productively for lasting change.
What can be done to save protests? Researchers point to a few elements of successful protests, even in authoritarian contexts: a strict adherence to non-violence; lawfulness; the participation of a diverse coalition that unites for a cause; and clarity in demands. Let’s hope voices protesting for just causes are able to abide by these principles, and that Machado’s prize inspires more democratic activism than the backlash to it.

Threats and bellicose statements by Indian officials have continued sporadically after the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May. But the spate of recent utterances by India’s political and military leaders struck a more ominous note and has made the already fraught environment more tense.
Last week, three provocative statements from Indian officials raised the temperature between the two countries. The most egregious remarks were by the Indian army chief Upendra Dwived­i, who said Pakistan will face erasure from the world map if it doesn’t stop cross-border terrorism. He warned that India won’t show the “restraint” it did during ‘Operation Sindoor’.
He also said India “can cross any border whenever necessary”. He asked his troops to stay in readiness as an “opportunity may come soon”. Subsequently, India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh accused Pakistan of expanding its military infrastructure in the Sir Creek sector, saying if Pakistan dared to act here “the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography”. Sir Creek is a 96 kilometre-long tidal estuary in the Rann of Kutch, disputed by the two neighbours. It has been the subject of inconclusive negotiations over the maritime boundary, the last such talks taking place in 2012.
On Oct 5, India’s air force chief Amar Preet Singh came up with the canard that India had shot down nine to 10 Pakistani fighter jets in the May clash, including two F-16s. He reiterated the threat that the Indian air force had “the capability to strike deep inside any of the [terrorist] hideouts [in Pakistan] with absolutely accurate targeting” and could do that anytime.
Pakistan pulled no punches in its reaction to these statements. A statement issued after a meeting of the top military brass, presided over by army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, vowed to give a “swift retributory response” to any “new normal” that the Indian leadership might be conjuring up.
Earlier, the military’s media affairs office slammed the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic” statements from the highest echelons of the Indian security establishment and cast them as a “renewed attempt at fabricating a pretext for aggression”. The Inter-Services Public Relations statement warned any future conflict could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” as Pakistan would respond without any restraint. Taking aim at the Indian army chief’s threat, it said those talking about “erasure” should know “the erasure would be mutual”.

Recent Indian statements may just be empty threats but Pakistan cannot lower its guard.

The questions raised by the latest round of Indian threats and escalatory rhetoric are what is driving them at this point and how seriously should they be taken. One explanation of the aggressive narrative is that it is aimed at the domestic audience, especially the ruling party’s Hindu base. Whipping up anti-Pakistan sentiment is a time-old tactic used by the BJP for electoral gain. With crucial state elections in Bihar drawing close and due early next year in West Bengal, the Narendra Modi government, under fire from the opposition for its conduct in the May conflict, is seeking to shore up its shaky position. This may be one aim, but not the only one.
The Indian establishment is still smarting from Pakistan gaining the decisive upper hand in the May conflict as epitomised by the shooting down of several Indian aircraft. Thus such rhetoric might be a way to obfuscate that outcome. But it seems more than that.
The reputational damage India suffered both at home and internationally has driven the motivation to avenge that loss of face. From this perspective and because Indian leaders keep hinting at another ‘round’ with Pakistan, some form of Indian incursion or aggressive action cannot be ruled out, especially as Indian leaders insist the rules of engagement and battle lines have irreversibly changed.
Pakistani officials do not underestimate this possibility but believe the Indians may be deterred from embarking on another adventure by calculations such as Pakistan’s warnings of an even more muscular counter-response and changed regional and global dynamics.
To be sure the international environment is far from being permissive for any Indian military action against Pakistan. Islamabad’s strengthened ties with the US, India’s strained relations with Washington, China’s unflinching diplomatic and military support for Pakistan and the Pakistan-Saudi strategic mutual defence pact have reshaped the geostrategic landscape to New Delhi’s detriment. If India received virtually no international support for its military strikes on Pakistan in May, it can hardly count on it in a significantly transformed environment. But a counter-argument is that India may want to test the limits of the possible in a global environment where the use of force — hard power — has become the ‘new normal’ and thus more ‘acceptable’ than ever before.
Pakistan in any case cannot afford to leave anything to chance or lower its guard. There should be no distraction from focusing on the eastern border by any military commitments it may be considering in the Middle East under President Trump’s Gaza ‘peace plan’. The country’s own security should take precedence over deploying military assets elsewhere, which in any case exposes Pakistan to other risks.
Beyond official Indian statements, it is instructive to read comments in the Indian media by foreign policy experts and former diplomats as they reveal deep concerns and worry about India’s international isolation and loss of diplomatic initiative to Pakistan. An analysis by India Today saw Pakistan “redrawing its strategic playbook”, forging new alliances and carrying out a recalibration that underscored a shifting regional order. This had important implications for India and would test its resolve.
Others fret over ‘Trump’s tilt to Pakistan’, with some construing this as a pressure tactic against India. Troubled by the loss of ally Bangladesh, some analysts have warned of an “alignment of adversarial powers around India”. The opposition Congress party has repeatedly said India is diplomatically isolated, decried the government for fraught Indo-US relations and for the loss of global influence.
Domestic pressure on the Indian government could compel it to act recklessly. But conversely, the uncertain outcome of military action against Pakistan could urge caution. In any event Pakistan must stay on high alert and be ready for all eventualities.

The number of attacks carried out by TTP terrorists inside Pakistan had been growing in frequency and lethality, with a high number of security men martyred over the last few weeks.
On Thursday, there had been reports of attacks inside Afghanistan, including the apparent targeting of the TTP chief in Kabul. The Afghan regime issued a vague statement about the attack, making no mention of casualties, while Pakistan neither confirmed nor denied the operation, with both civil and military officials only saying Afghanistan needed to stop harbouring TTP terrorists.
It is in the backdrop of these events that the Kabul regime launched attacks against Pakistan. The military says that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” had been killed, while 23 troops had been martyred.
The hostilities have ceased for the time being. As per the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, the Kabul regime paused the fighting after “our friends, Qatar and Saudi Arabia” expressed the need to de-escalate. Iran, which shares a border with both states, also offered its good offices to the “two neighbouring and Muslim countries” to bring down tensions.
Pakistan, after showing it is capable of defending itself and repelling aggression, should prevent the matter from spiralling further. Though there have been low-level skirmishes in the past, this is the biggest flare-up in recent years.
Pakistan must also be wary of the fact that India and the Afghan Taliban — once sworn enemies — have suddenly experienced a warming of ties, with the Afghan foreign minister receiving a cordial reception in New Delhi recently. Therefore, it would not be in this country’s interest to let ties with Kabul — however fraught — deteriorate further.
At the heart of the matter is Pakistan’s legitimate grievance that Afghanistan hosts bloodthirsty terrorists inimical to this country. In fact, it is accepted by the international community that Kabul provides safe haven to not only the TTP, but other terrorist groups as well, such as Al Qaeda, ETIM, etc.
If these groups keep launching attacks inside this country, Pakistan must react. But while kinetic cross-border action has to be taken when faced with foreign aggression, this is not a long-term solution, as it risks sparking a full-fledged war with the Kabul regime. Pakistan has shown that it can very much defend itself on the battlefield. Now the focus must shift to addressing the issue of terrorism through diplomacy. This can be done by working with Muslim states that have helped de-escalate matters, as well as engaging regional allies such as China, which have influence with Kabul.

This statement comes in the wake of intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
After the incident, an FO statement said: “Pakistan greatly values dialogue and diplomacy and a mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan.
“At the same time, the Government of Pakistan continues to closely monitor the situation and would take all possible measures to safeguard its territory and the lives of its people. Any further provocations would be met with an unwavering and befitting response.”
The FO expressed concern about the “unwarranted aggression by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan”, which it said would destabilise neighbourly relations between the two nations.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
Referring to Saturday night’s border clashes, the FO said: “Pakistan, exercising its right of self-defence, not only effectively repulsed the assaults all along the border, but also inflicted heavy losses on Taliban forces and affiliated kharjis, in terms of men, material and infrastructure.” It added that the said infrastructure was used to “plan and facilitate” acts of terror.
 
 

The FO also strongly rejected “assertions and insinuations” by Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to divert attention from the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan.
Muttaqi is currently on a visit to India, where he said in recent a speech that there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan and Pakistan’s problems needed to be resolved internally.
“By making these baseless assertions, the Taliban regime cannot absolve itself of its responsibilities towards regional peace and stability,” the FO statement said.
“[The] continued presence of terrorist elements on Afghan soil and the freedom of activities enjoyed by them in Afghanistan are well documented in UN Monitoring Team reports.”
Noting that the fight against terrorism was a “common cause”, the FO urged Kabul to honour its commitment of barring the use of its territory for terrorism against other countries and to play its role in achieving peace and stability in the region, rather than shifting the blame.
“Pakistan has repeatedly shared its concerns related to the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan operating from the Afghan soil,” the FO stated. “Pakistan expects concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime.”
“Pakistan is desirous of a peaceful, stable, friendly, inclusive, regionally connected, and prosperous Afghanistan. Pakistan expects the Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour its commitments, and play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from its soil,” the statement concluded.
Afghan refugees
The FO also noted Pakistan’s hosting of four million Afghan refugees as a gesture of “good neighbourliness, Islamic brotherhood and humanity” and added that it would “take all actions to regulate the presence of Afghan nationals on its territory, in accordance with international norms and laws”.
Earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reacted to the border clashes, saying that “Afghan refugees living in our country for 50 years would now have to return to their homeland”.
The Pak-Afghan border should be like other borders around the world, which no one should be able to cross at their will, he added.

Rescue officials repo­r­ted that the blast triggered a surge in underground water, which led to the cave-in. According to pol­ice, the collapse occurred shortly after the explosion, leaving the workers stranded inside.
 
 

Joint rescue teams from the Hangu and Kurram districts swiftly arrived at the scene and launched an operation to save the trapped miners.
Equipped with modern machinery, the teams have started pumping water out of the flooded section of the mine.

The fighting ensued after the Afghan Taliban, around 9pm, targeted the Pakistani position along the Gavi border belt in Kurram. The apparent provocation for this cross-border aggression was a drone strike by Pakistan on a militant hideout in which 27 terrorists were killed inside the Pakistani territory.
What began in the north soon expanded to the rest of the border, as Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts from Kunar, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces. Tirah Valley also came under attack after mortar shells fired by the Afghan Taliban landed in a village, leaving a civilian dead and a child injured.
Before midnight, both sides had entered fierce clashes and Pakistani forces had begun to conduct decisive artillery and air force strikes to take out the hostile positions along the border, forcing the Taliban fighters to retreat. Besides heavy artillery, PAF jets pounded multiple Afghan posts and militant positions, said sources who closely monitored the hours-long overnight battle.

How it all started from a drone strike on a hideout of terrorists

According to sources, air raids by Pakistan targeted hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. The jets with their precision strikes destroyed the 2nd Kandak headquarters and strongholds of Aziz, Rawat, and Naka among others. “By midnight, 11 Afghan posts were neutralised and 27 hostile targets were destroyed, with heavy explosions heard deep inside the Afghan territory,” they said.
As PAF jets thundered in the Afghan airspace taking out the Taliban border posts and terrorist positions, the Taliban forces reached out to Pakistan for a ceasefire — a request turned down by Pakistan and military operations continued late into the early hours of Sunday.
From 2am to 4am, the artillery with the PAF continued to pound Afghan positions, reportedly destroying the enemy sites at Barbcha, Ali Dost, Malgai Koh, Turkmanzai Top, and Kharachar Fort. This onslaught forced the Afghan forces to withdraw from several forward posts after they suffered major losses.
Attacks along border
In Lower Dir, Pakistani security forces gave a strong response to the Afghan forces at the Shahi Binshahi Border, repulsing attacks and forcing the Taliban forces to retreat.
In Lower South Waziristan, several villages along the border came under Afghan fire — a move that prompted retaliation by the forces, which inflicted significant human and material losses on the Afghan side. Sources added that during the retaliatory operation, one Afghan post was captured, and the Pakistani flag was subsequently hoisted at the captured position.
Amid these clashes, there were multiple infiltration attempts soon after midnight when the Taliban tried to infiltrate from Sra Kwand in Angoor Adda area of South Waziristan, said sources. This was, however, foiled.
After hours of bombing and gunfire, the situation returned to normalcy around 4am. “The situation remains tense but under control on Pakistan’s side as PAF jets and artillery units remain on high alert as cross-border fire reportedly subsided after 04:00 hours, but heightened vigilance continued along the western frontier,” sources said.
As Pakistan and Afghanistan traded fire, the authorities immediately closed the Angoor Adda border, resulting in a complete suspension of bilateral trade activities. The sudden closure left dozens of trucks stranded on both sides of the border. It may be mentioned here that Angoor Adda border had reopened only ten days ago after a closure of two years.
In Khyber, the Torkhum border crossing was also closed. However, the situation at this crossing remained peaceful. Residents at the Bacha Maina residential compound told Dawn that some of the families moved to Landi Kotal after the border security forces ordered the closure of the border at midnight.
In North Waziristan, the Ghulam Khan border was closed following an exchange of fire between Pakistani and Afghan forces in different areas along the border.
In Kurram, an emergency was declared in all hospitals and the Kharlachi border crossing with Afghanistan was closed. Tribal fighters in the district reportedly moved to assist security forces on the frontline amid continuous artillery duels near Kharlachi and Manujaba Forts.

The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.

Key developments

ISPR says 23 security personnel have been martyred and 29 injured
More than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, says military’s media wing
21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps were rendered inoperative, according to ISPR
PM Shehbaz vows ‘every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response’
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran call for restraint after clashes broke out last night


“During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured.
“According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher,” the ISPR statement said.
Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil.
But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”.
According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan, which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border.
“Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij,” the ISPR said.
“Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij, Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh.
“All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.”
The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border.
Providing further details, it said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative.
“The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”.
The ISPR further said: “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.”
It underlined that while the people of Pakistan preferred constructive diplomacy and dialogue over violence and belligerence, “we will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”.
“We have noted with concern that this serious provocation has occurred during the visit of the [Afghan] Taliban foreign minister to India, the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the region.
“In the interest of regional peace and security, we call upon the Taliban government to take immediate and verifiable actions to neutralise the terrorist groups, inter alia, Fitna-al-Khawarij, Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh operating from their territory.”
Otherwise, it asserted, Pakistan will continue to exercise its right to defend its people by persistently neutralising terror targets.
It said that the Taliban government should “shun any ill-begotten notions and prioritise well-being, peace, prosperity and development of the Afghan people over irresponsible sabre-rattling”.
The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Last night’s episode vindicates Pakistan’s long-standing position that the Taliban government is actively facilitating the terrorists.
“If the Taliban government continues to sponsor terrorist outfits, in cohorts with India, for the shortsighted objective of destabilising the region, the people and the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.”
Afghan posts targeted by army
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported details of the Afghan posts targeted by the Pakistan Army. The sources said the army had launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”.
“Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added.
Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak. They noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out.
Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”.
Meanwhile, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan shared footage of a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp at Spin Boldak.
 






The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources.
In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3, Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed.
According to Radio Pakistan, security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in the Zhob sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” the report said.
Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the state media reported, citing security sources.
 






In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”.
On the other hand, Pakistan’s posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said.
Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area.
 






Afghan govt urges Pakistan to ‘desist from using force’
Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”.
Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan”.
He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”.
 






Earlier, the Afghan military said in a statement that “in retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces”, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”.
Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — had confirmed the clashes.
The Afghan Ministry of Defence also confirmed earlier that Afghan forces had launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight.
“The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement.
Kabul said on Sunday that it had halted attacks at the request of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Reuters reported.
Separately, it was reported that the Torkham border crossing had been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side.
Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar.
Separately,Reuters, citing local officials, reported that two main border crossings with Afghanistan, at Torkham and Chaman, and at least three minor crossings, at Kharlachi, Angoor Adda and Ghulam Khan, were closed on Sunday.
‘No compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty’
Earlier in the day, as reports with details of the skirmishes continued to emerge, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted there would be “no compromise” on Pakistan’s sovereignty.
President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counter-terrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace.
Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”.
He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”.
The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”.
 


President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”.
“Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying.
 






In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir, “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”.
He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions.
The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”.
 
 

However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace.
“President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said.
The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted.
 
 

President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace.
He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region.
PM Shehbaz, too, strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”.
“There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted.
“We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”.
“The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said.
 






“Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”.
The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan, who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”.
 
 

“Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan.
In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response.
“Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X.
“Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.”
 






Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”.
“Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X.
 






“Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added.
He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”.
“Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged.
Former foreign minister and PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also called upon Afghan authorities to “act with restraint and responsibility in the interest of regional peace”.
“Unprovoked aggression by Afghan forces along our border poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability, while undermining collective efforts toward shared prosperity,” he said in a statement.
Bilawal said Pakistan’s armed forces had responded with resolve, restraint, and professionalism, reflecting Pakistan’s enduring commitment to peace and stability while safeguarding every inch of national territory and protecting civilian lives.
He further urged the Taliban authorities in Kabul to take concrete and verifiable action against terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil, warning that such groups threaten not only Pakistan but also the security and future of the entire region.
“Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Taliban leadership to engage in practical, result-oriented dialogue and cooperation to secure enduring peace and stability in our shared neighborhood,” he said.
Bilawal expressed hope that the interim Afghan government would ensure that Afghan soil was not used against Pakistan and that both countries would work together in the spirit of mutual respect to promote peace, stability, and prosperity across the region and beyond.
Calls for restraint
After the border clashes were reported, multiple countries urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to exercise restraint.
Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal, expressed concern at the skirmishes.
“The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region.
“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.”
 






Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes.
“Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”.
 






Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability.
The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries.
 






Events preceding the border clashes
The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory.
An instance of Pakistan asserting its position was when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly,
“Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out.”
While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday of bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan on Thursday.
The Foreign Office in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing on Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a visit to India when the border clashes began, had condemned Thursday’s incident and Pakistan’s alleged role in it during a press conference in New Delhi.
It was India’s — with which Pakistan’s ties have historically been tense — first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. On Friday, New Delhi also announced that it would be reopening its embassy in Kabul after four years.
 
 

These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.

Federal Minister for Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain says small and medium farmers, who make up the majority of cultivators, face persistent challenges in accessing modern technology, affordable inputs, and profitable markets. Cooperative farming, he said, provides a collective solution to these problems.
Informed estimates suggest that slightly over 90 per cent of the total farming community in Pakistan falls under the category of small farms with less than 12.5 acres of land for cultivation, says an international consultant, adding, “this very community, the majority, will be at threat” from corporate farming.
As per Dr Ally R Memon, an academic based in the UK and involved with public sector consultancy projects, cooperative farming is a system where farmers voluntarily join together to form organisations (cooperatives) with the intention of mutual benefit under the core idea of collective action.

As the government urges the necessity of collaborative agriculture practices, critics question the actual benefits to small and medium sized farms

It is a way of organising, elaborates Dr Memon, whereby joint purchasing of inputs occurs. Produce is collectively marketed to get better prices, equipment and labour is shared, financial services are provided to members of the cooperative, and so on. Success in cooperative farming is measured by its contribution to the incomes of farmers who are part of cooperatives.
However, the ability and scope of independent small-scale farmers to benefit or perform in a corporate farming environment may be handicapped, weakened or diminished. In his article titled ‘Corporate vs Cooperative Farming’ published by The Friday Times, Dr Memon questions who the real beneficiary of cooperative farming will be.
In his view, “The corporations will be able to control supply chains and determine pricing [ie market manipulation].” He further shared that corporations absorb small local farmers even in developed countries.
Mr Hussain, on the other hand, has a different view on cooperative farming. In a recent press release the federal minister stated, “Cooperative farming ensures that every farmer, regardless of land size, has access to advanced machinery, climate-smart techniques, interest-free agri-finance, and direct market linkages.” He further explained that this model reduces production costs, eliminates middlemen, and guarantees farmers a fair share of profit.
The federal minister stressed: “This is not merely an agricultural plan; it is a social and economic revolution that will empower farmers and secure Pakistan’s future.”

“The corporations will be able to control supply chains and determine pricing [ie market manipulation],” worries Dr Ally R Memon, an academic based in the UK

Tested on a tiny scale, according to a study by local experts, cash crop farmers, who were part of a cooperative in Punjab, witnessed an increase in the yield, with a 38pc higher benefit-cost ratio than non-cooperative growers.
Moreover, a Food and Agricultural Organisation document released on October 22, 2024 recommended that Pakistan should promote the formation of farmer cooperatives to pool resources, share knowledge, and jointly invest in machinery. It recommended developing and disseminating low-cost mechanisation solutions through partnerships, cooperative models, and policy dialogue.
Experts say mechanised farming is neither feasible nor possible on small farms. It is cooperative farming which can make it possible by consolidating small holdings into enlarged farm sizes.
The Cooperative Societies Amendment Act of 2020 provides the legal framework for the establishment of cooperative entities and outlines the rules and procedures for the registration, administration, and functioning of cooperative societies, emphasising democratic decision-making and equitable distribution of benefits.
The government has also accepted recommendations of the National Commission for Food and Agriculture regarding the need to introduce cooperative farming in Pakistan, says Dr Memon.
Today, more than 12pc of the world’s population are members of three million cooperatives, providing 280m jobs worldwide. The world’s 300 largest cooperatives have a global turnover of about $2.4 trillion.
Chairing a high-level meeting on cooperative farming and marketing, also attended by Rana Iftikhar Muhammad, President of the Chamber of Agriculture Punjab, and other stakeholders, the federal minister called the government’s initiative the “backbone of sustainable agriculture”.
The cooperative farming model will not only uplift the rural economy but also help Pakistan reduce reliance on costly food imports, Mr Hussain stressed. With improved yields through intercropping and value addition, he added, the country can cut down its reliance on imported wheat, pulses, and edible oil, saving valuable foreign exchange.
Cooperative farming is a bottom-up approach to bring a vital segment of the informal economy into the documented sector.
However, transparency and accountability to shareholders are required to ensure a fair deal to everyone pooling their farmland and resources to make the cooperative a success which would then lead to the value of each piece of land expressed in corresponding shareholding to rise. This would encourage more small farmers to join co-operatives.
The government is committed to supporting farmers through modern storage facilities, processing units, and export-oriented packaging centres under the cooperative model, said the minister.
Reaffirming the government’s resolve, he said the ministry would provide technical guidance and financial assistance through innovative mechanisms to ensure success.
Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 13th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-13 03:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13075431bd56de6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948516/prisoners-convicted-under-ata-not-entitled-to-pardon-says-bhc' target='_blank'><strong>Prisoners convicted under ATA not entitled to pardon, says BHC</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has ruled that prisoners convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997 are not legally entitled to any form of general or special remission or pardon.
The court declared that Section 21-F of the ATA explicitly excludes terrorists from eligibility for clemency or sentence reduction, leaving no room for interpretation or relaxation.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Najamuddin Mengal announced the verdict while hearing several constitutional petitions filed in 2023 and 2024, dismissing all of them collectively.
 
 

According to the judgement, the petitioners had argued that they were entitled to the president’s pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution and to general or special remission under the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
However, the court held that the insertion of Section 21-F in 2001 was specifically intended to permanently exclude terrorism convicts from the scope of pardons. The bench noted that the amendment was a deliberate legislative act aimed at protecting public safety amid rising incidents of terrorism.
 
 

The court emphasised that the Anti-Terrorism Act is a special law that takes precedence over general laws, including the Prisons Act of 1894. It further rejected the argument that denying remission to terrorism convicts violates Article 25 (Equality Before Law) of the Constitution, stating that terrorism convicts constitute a distinct legal class, and such classification is reasonable and constitutionally valid.
Citing precedents from the Supreme Court cases of Sherwani, Government of Balochistan vs. Azizullah, and Dr Mubashir Hassan vs. Federation of Pakistan, the bench affirmed that reasonable classification is permissible under the Constitution.
The court directed the Home Depar­t­ment, Inspector General of Prisons, and relevant superintendents to immediately revoke all illegal remissions granted contrary to the law and recalculate the sentences of affected inmates.
It also instructed that future pardons or remissions must strictly comply with legal provisions, warning that officers violating the law would face disciplinary action.

This delay matters. Without a final agreement, disbursements remain stalled, holding back around $1.25 billion in critical inflows. Pakistan’s balance of payments remains precariously dependent on timely IMF tranches, donor releases, and friendly-country deposits.
The World Bank’s recent analysis paints a starker picture: poverty reduction has not just stalled — it has reversed. In its September 2025 report, the Bank reveals that the national projected poverty rate rose to 25.3 per cent in FY24, up by about seven percentage points since FY22 over three years, reaching its highest level in six years.
Under the international poverty threshold, the incidence is even more severe — 44.7pc of Pakistanis now live below the global poverty line. The report warns that Pakistan’s earlier growth model, which drove sizable gains in poverty reduction during 2001–2015, has proven insufficient to cope with recent shocks. Economic turbulence, inflation, and recurring climate disasters have pushed households that had only just escaped poverty back under the line.

Amid short-term struggles, the need to set a long-term course cannot be postponed

Pakistan has achieved notable stabilisation on some economic fronts. The current account posted a surplus of about $2.1 billion in FY25 — the first annual surplus in 14 years — reversing a deficit of the same magnitude the year before.
Remittances surged about 27pc year-on-year to $38.3bn, pushing total liquid foreign exchange reserves close to $20bn now.
 
 

These gains, however, mask underlying fragility: the goods trade deficit is widening — up 46pc year-on-year to $3.34bn in September — and much of last year’s current account surplus’s positive impact remains tied to remittance inflows rather than a broad export revival. That explains a quick reversal of the surplus trend in this fiscal year. In July-August 2025 Pakistan booked a current account deficit of $624m.
In the short term, policymakers must fight multiple fires at once. The first is securing external financing. The IMF programme remains the only credible anchor for investor confidence and donor coordination. Any slippage in programme benchmarks or delays in disbursement could quickly reignite pressure on the currency and debt markets.
The second is managing the fiscal squeeze. With public debt exceeding 70pc of GDP and interest payments consuming half of total revenue, the state has little room to manoeuvre. Yet austerity that bites too hard risks social backlash and further contraction.
Weak growth itself is another concern. With the economy expanding by 3.04pc in the last fiscal year, unemployment remains high and private investment hesitant. Fiscal and monetary levers offer limited traction: stimulus risks fuelling inflation; restraint dampens recovery.
Moreover, climate vulnerability compounds the problem. The floods of 2025 — following the devastation of 2022 — displaced millions, wiped out crops, and demanded large-scale reconstruction spending. Climate adaptation has become a recurring fiscal emergency, not a distant concern.
Amid these near-term struggles, the need to set a long-term course cannot be postponed. Pakistan’s recurring crises stem from structural flaws — low revenue mobilisation, inefficient public spending, energy and water mismanagement, weak human capital, and policy inconsistency.
Raising the tax-to-GDP ratio remains the single most critical reform for fiscal sustainability. The country’s tax-to-GDP ratio only recently hit 10.6pc by the end of June 2025. Broadening the base, eliminating exemptions, and digitising collection are not glamorous measures, but they are indispensable.
 
 

Institutional reform is equally urgent. Public financial management must become more transparent, budgets more credible, and expenditures better prioritised. Decades of fragmented decision-making and ad hoc subsidies have distorted both incentives and outcomes.
Similarly, energy-sector restructuring — reducing circular debt, aligning tariffs with cost recovery, and shifting toward renewables — is essential for both fiscal health and climate resilience. Without it, Pakistan will continue borrowing to pay for inefficiencies.
Private investment and export competitiveness are the missing engines of sustainable growth. The export base remains narrow, the business environment unpredictable. Simplifying regulations, ensuring exchange-rate realism, and lowering input bottlenecks can revive manufacturing and services. Human capital, too, must rise to the top of the policy agenda. Education, health, and digital inclusion determine whether Pakistan’s youth bulge becomes a demographic dividend or a burden.
Bridging short-term stabilisation with long-term reform requires a deliberate blueprint. The authorities must first complete the IMF review and secure disbursements to buy breathing space. Then, instead of blanket expenditure cuts, the government should reallocate spending — away from untargeted subsidies and toward high-impact social protection, health, and climate resilience programmes.
Reconstruction should be financed primarily through concessional loans and grants, not expensive market debt. Immediate revenue gains should come from administrative measures — closing loopholes, tightening compliance, and integrating federal and provincial tax efforts.
Communication is critical. Building political consensus, engaging provinces constructively, and explaining trade-offs openly can prevent policy reversals and maintain momentum.
Pakistan’s leadership today faces a tough balancing act. It must face short-term challenges while sowing the seeds of long-term economic renewal. That means taking ownership of reforms, protecting the vulnerable, and aligning every policy choice with a national direction.

• Over 830,000 children are missed every time
ISLAMABAD: While 830,000 children are missed during every polio campaign, another nationwide campaign to vaccinate 45 million under five children will begin on Monday in 159 districts.
According to the Nat­ional Emer­g­ency Oper­a­tions Centre (NEOC) the campaign will start from Oct 13 and it will end on Oct 19. Children will also receive a supplementary dose of Vitamin A to boost their immunity.
According to NEOC, in Southern Khyber Pakh­t­u­nkhwa, the polio campaign will be conducted separately from Oct 20 to 23, to ensure comprehensive coverage in the region. The NEOC has emphasised the importance of timely completion of the routine immunisation sch­edule for all children of up to 15 months.
 
 

A polio programme official, wishing not to be named, said more than 400,000 frontline health workers, including 225,000 female vaccinators, will go door-to-door across Baloc­h­istan, Sindh, Khyber Pak­htu­nkhwa, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Isl­a­m­abad, ensuring no child is missed.
“This campaign is especially critical. The recent flooding across several regions has increased the risk of polio transmission and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Standing wat­er, poor sanitation, and displacement have created conditions for the virus to spread, making it urgent to vaccinate every child under five,” he said.
Last week, Prime Min­i­s­ter’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq during a media interaction, had said that the number of children missing polio vaccination drive has come down from over 1.1 million in October 2024 to around 830,000 in May 2025.
She said that sustained coordination, joint planning, and unified action are essential to closing immunity gaps. She noted that these efforts were particularly critical in high-risk areas such as the south Khyber Pakht­u­n­khwa (KP) block and Kar­a­chi, where poliovirus continued to be detected in environmental samples.
Over 2.6m to be covered in Balochistan
In Balochistan, polio teams will target over 2.66 million children under the age of five for polio vac­c­i­n­ation. Emergency Operations Centre coordinator Inamul Haq said on Sunday that all arrangements for the campaign have been finalised, and 11,144 teams will participate across the province, including 825 fixed teams and 476 transit teams.
He warned that the pol­iovirus is present in Bal­ochistan’s environment, posing a constant threat to children’s health.
“This campaign is vital to protect children from the virus and eliminate poliovirus from the environment,” he said, emphasising that parents must ensure their children rec­eive the vaccine, as polio can cause lifelong, irreversible paralysis.
Mr Haq further said the campai­gn’s success depends on public cooperation. He appealed to civil soc­iety, teachers, and religious leaders to raise awareness and encourage parents to get their children vaccinated.
Highlighting the importance of immunisation, he reminded parents that routine vaccines protect children from 12 deadly diseases, including measles, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and diphtheria. He urged parents to visit nearby health centres and ensure their children receive all vaccines on time.

The coalition of several opposition parties, which rejects the alleged rigging in 2024 elections, also accused the government of creating hurdles in the transfer of power to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) nominated chief minister in KP.
The TTAP meeting, held at the residence of Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad, was attended by alliance head Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Sal­man Akram Raja, Asad Qaiser, Muh­ammad Zubair, Allama Ahmed Rizvi, Sajid Tareen, Zain Shah, Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, Asad Abbas and others.
They suggested that the issues between Pakistan and Afghanistan should be addressed through dialogue and urged the government to call the joint session of parliament to discuss the internal and external issues.

Accuses goverment of creating hurdles for PTI-nominated KP CM

In a statement, the TTAP also condemned remarks by federal ministers, calling them a hurdle in the way of the transfer of power in KP and warned that it would further deteriorate and complicate the law and order situation in the province.
The alliance also alleged that the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to declare KP Assembly legislators independent candidates was undemocratic and an attempt to promote horse-trading in the provincial assembly.
The participants showed concerns over the law and order situation and terrorism in KP and Balochistan and suggested that the issues should be addressed by taking the provincial gov­­ernments and local people on board.
However, PML-N senator Irfan Siddiqui termed the TTAP’s statement “shameful”, saying the alliance had maligned law-enforcement agencies instead of condemning militants. He stressed that the demand for negotiations was being made for a long time and that was why the province had become a safe haven for militants.

These structural flaws deepen economic fragility and expose the limits of stopgap solutions. The answer may lie not in the next megaproject or short-term tariff adjustment, but in the next generation of nuclear technology — micro and small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of delivering reliable, clean, and decentralised power.
For once, diplomacy and energy may align. The recent warming in relations with the Trump administration provides Pakistan with an opportunity to reset its energy diplomacy. Instead of seeking aid or debt relief, Islamabad could aim for a strategic energy partnership centred on advanced microreactors — turning goodwill into tangible infrastructure.
Unlike the unwieldy nuclear projects of the past, SMRs are compact, factory-built units designed for rapid deployment and modular scaling. A single 10MW microreactor can power an industrial cluster or a remote district; several units linked together can support an entire urban grid. In a country where blackouts routinely cripple productivity, such flexibility could prove transformative.
 
 

Washington’s renewed interest in Pakistan — driven partly by its desire to counterbalance China and restore strategic influence in South Asia — could provide an avenue for collaboration. If Islamabad plays its cards wisely, it could secure long-term fuel supply contracts, regulatory cooperation, and access to cutting-edge modular designs, much like agreements being negotiated with allies such as Canada and Poland.

A trilateral model involving American technology, Chinese construction expertise, and Pakistani oversight could share risk while balancing strategic interests for small and micro modular radiators

The technology itself has matured significantly. US-based NuScale Power received final approval for its 77 MWe reactor design in 2025, the first fully certified SMR of its kind. Its modules, factory-fabricated and shipped for assembly, promise construction timelines measured in months rather than years. GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, a 300 MWe unit using simplified boiling-water technology, is already being deployed in North America and Europe.
Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor — a transportable, five-megawatt “nuclear battery” — can operate for up to eight years without refuelling, tailored for remote industrial or military applications. Last Energy, a US-European startup, takes this concept further with “power plants in a box”, designed for serial production and rapid installation.
Bill Gates, in his October 3, 2025 article “The Future of Energy is Subatomic” on Gates Notes, highlights TerraPower’s Natrium reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming, a 345 MW sodium-cooled fast reactor replacing a retiring coal plant. Mr Gates underscores that such reactors provide consistent baseload power, integrate with renewables, produce far less waste, and significantly reduce accident risk compared with legacy plants. His advocacy reinforces that small modular reactors are not theoretical but viable, near-term technologies with global precedent — a lesson Pakistan can apply.
Critics often highlight the high upfront cost of nuclear power. While a single microreactor may cost $5–6 million per megawatt, modular construction changes the equation. Factory standardisation reduces site-specific risk, shortens build times, and cuts labour costs. By contrast, utility-scale solar plants typically cost $0.8–1m per megawatt to install, but their intermittent output requires expensive storage or backup to deliver 24/7 power, often doubling or tripling the effective cost per megawatt.
Microreactors generate reliable baseload power on roughly one-thirtieth of the land area required for solar power and consume far less water than conventional thermal plants, thereby easing environmental stress in arid regions like southern Pakistan. When factoring storage, transmission losses, and land constraints, the effective cost of dependable solar approaches or even exceeds that of a factory-built microreactor.
For Pakistan, the financial logic extends beyond generation costs.
Microreactors can displace expensive imported LNG and furnace oil while minimising transmission losses by being sited near consumption hubs. The economic multiplier from industrial uptime, job creation, and localised power reliability may outweigh initial expenditures.
Financing remains the key challenge. Western private investment in Pakistan’s nuclear sector has long been constrained by security and credit risk. Yet if Trump-era diplomacy opens the door to technology transfer and export-credit guarantees, US and allied investors could find a viable foothold. A trilateral model involving American technology, Chinese construction expertise, and Pakistani oversight could share risk while balancing strategic interests.
Public scepticism about nuclear energy — particularly radiation hazards — remains strong. However, research from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency and the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory indicates that SMRs with TRISO fuel and passive safety systems can contain fission products even under extreme scenarios, thereby virtually eliminating the probability of large-scale releases.
The International Atomic Energy Agency classifies the accident risk of advanced reactors as being orders of magnitude lower than that of legacy systems. Microreactors still generate radioactive waste requiring careful lifecycle management, but sealed fuel cartridges can be removed, stored, or reprocessed under international supervision. Transparent monitoring and community engagement can address safety concerns before they escalate into political obstacles.
Pakistan’s nuclear establishment — particularly the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority — has decades of operational experience, though its regulatory culture is geared toward large, state-led plants.
Transitioning to modular reactors demands a lighter, adaptive framework: simplified licensing, digital oversight, and standardised safety validation. International cooperation, especially with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, could accelerate this process.
Equally critical is human capital. Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology can lead specialised curricula for reactor operations, digital controls, and emergency response, ensuring a skilled workforce.
If Pakistan hesitates, it risks falling behind. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Finland have approved pilot SMR projects. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are exploring modular nuclear options for industrial decarbonisation. For Pakistan — facing energy scarcity and fiscal constraint — this is not just an opportunity but a necessity.
Micro nuclear reactors will not solve every problem. They require disciplined governance, transparent financing, and sustained political commitment. Yet pursued strategically, they could become the backbone of a cleaner, resilient, and self-reliant energy system.
Pakistan has the scientific expertise, industrial base, and — for the first time in years — a favourable diplomatic environment. By leveraging improved ties with Washington, incorporating lessons from global leaders like Bill Gates on SMRs, and combining that with pragmatic partnerships and regulatory foresight, Islamabad can turn promise into power.
Microreactors, once futuristic, may yet define Pakistan’s next leap — lighting cities, powering industries, and freeing the economy from the chains of energy insecurity.

• Lahore DIG confirms reinforcements sent
• Mobile data partially restored in twin cities
• Around 170 TLP members held in Sahiwal division
• PM, Naqvi review situation
LAHORE: Law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke early on Sunday and reportedly surrounded the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation.
They also foiled two attempts by the party’s supporters to move beyond the city as authorities dug trenches and sealed routes to block the march on Islamabad.
Officers were placed on high alert to respond to any emergency. Senior Lahore police officers were instructed to remain on standby to lead deployments pending final orders.
Meanwhile, mobile data services were partially restored in Rawalpindi and Islamabad after talks with TLP began in Lahore, while around 170 people linked to the party were detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) in Sahiwal division.
 
 

In a separate development, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met on Sunday to review the country’s security situation. From Lahore, 10 officers from each of the city’s 85 police stations were directed to proceed to Muridke under their respective SHOs, in addition to anti-riot units.
Lahore Operations DIG Faisal Kamran and several SPs also reached the area to supervise the police force. Similar steps were taken by the Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Gujrat police. DIG Kamran confirmed to Dawn that Lahore police reinforcements arrived in Muridke on Sunday.
A source in the Punjab police said the decision to increase the strength of police officials followed a high-level meeting on Saturday night chaired by Inspector General of Punjab Police Dr Usman Anwar and attended by Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Faisal Kamran and several other senior officers.
During the meeting, the senior leadership of the Punjab police resolved to take “more stringent measures” in response to alleged vandalism, attacks on law enforcers and damage to public property by TLP protesters.
 
 

Officials briefed the meeting that violent TLP supporters had repeatedly targeted police facilities at Shahdara, taking away 18 official motorbikes from a station compound and damaging infrastructure.
The meeting was briefed that the mob also snatched official vehicles of various government departments at gunpoint to use them in illegal activities.
Some Lahore policemen were reported missing amid fears they were abducted during clashes in Shahdara. According to the official, law enforcers said they twice blocked efforts by TLP supporters to move beyond Muridke on Sunday, with heavy police contingents from four districts surrounding the main procession. The TLP reached Muridke on Saturday and staged a sit-in after the district administrations dug large trenches to block routes.
According to reports, a group tried to cross the trenches on Sunday morning but retreated after security personnel used force and fired tear gas. A second attempt after noon met the same response, witnesses said.
By evening, reports suggested that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had urged supporters to remain calm and await his next orders while he held consultations. Meanwhile, mobile data services were partially restored in Rawalpindi and Islamabad after negotiations with the TLP began in Lahore.
On Sunday, Mr Rizvi condemned police action against party workers and said he had not yet given a final nod for the marchers to proceed to Islamabad. He told reporters the government had not contacted the TLP for negotiations, adding: “We are ready for talks.” He said the march was to show solidarity with Palestine, reiterated that Pakistan should not recognise Israel and alleged police were arresting large numbers of supporters and using “lethal weapons”.
Detentions
Around 170 people — including workers, office-bearers and activists linked to the TLP — were detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) across three districts of Sahiwal division.
The late-night operations between Friday and Saturday led to arrests from various locations and homes. Sources told Dawn that detainees were kept in central prisons in Pakpattan, Sahiwal and Okara.
Detention orders and lists of TLP members were issued by the respective deputy commissioners acting as district administrators.
Law enforcement agencies established checkpoints at key exits across the division — including Ravi Bridge, Chichawatni, Gamber Toll Plaza, Kasur-Pakpattan Road, Okara-Lahore National Highway, Qutab Shahana Bridge, Iqbal Nagar, Depalpur Bypass and Basirpur-Okara Road — following Mr Rizvi’s call to march on Islamabad.
Nearly 170 arrests were made across the three districts, including 69 in Pakpattan, 42 in Sahiwal and 50 in Okara. The MPO detention orders are valid for 30 days,  police and prison sources said.
Naqvi meets PM
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for detailed discussions on the country’s internal security, law and order situation, counterterrorism efforts and other key security matters.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Mr Naqvi briefed PM Shehbaz on the overall law and order situation across the country, stressing that measures were being undertaken by the Ministry of Interior to strengthen internal security.
The premier appreciated the efforts of the interior minister and his team, directing that coordinated and effective actions must continue to ensure the protection of citizens’ lives and property.
Reaffirming his government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz said safeguarding the lives and property of the people, upholding the rule of law and eradicating terrorism remain the government’s top priorities.

The criticism had notably come from India’s opposition Congress party, which rebuked the Narendra Modi government. There were calls for the Indian government to clarify its position on the matter and questioned its silence on the “discrimination”.
Subsequently, Indian news agency ANI posted a video of Muttaqi on X today, in which he was seen clarifying the matter in Pashto.
 






The Afghan foreign minister said, “Our teams had contacted a limited number of journalists for the press conference, and only those journalists were invited … It later emerged that some journalists were not on the list. It was nothing more than that.
“Our colleagues thought that those who had been on the list should be invited. So, the participants were limited. It was just this decision and no other.”
While there has been no official comment from the government of India, Dawn earlier reported that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi on his India visit. It quoted sources as saying that the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees.
Criticism
The criticism over the absence of women journalists notably came from opposition leader in India Rahul Gandhi, who posted on X: “Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space.
“Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti (woman power).“
 






His post followed Congress General Secretary Priyanka Vadra’s message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted.
“Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X.
Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh posted on X: (Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child.“
 






Similarly, former finance minister P. Chidambaram said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).”
 






Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging the Indian foreign minister in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind.
“To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.”
 






Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”.
“This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added.
The Afghan Taliban, who promised a softer rule after retaking power in Kabul in August 2021, have imposed sweeping restrictions on women, banning them from universities, public parks, gyms and beauty salons — measures the UN has labelled “gender apartheid”.</p><small>2025-10-12 20:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12225243235272c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948443/display-of-institutionalised-repression-byc-criticises-jail-hearing-of-mahrang-baloch-other-group-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>‘Display of institutionalised repression’: BYC criticises jail hearing of Mahrang Baloch, other group leaders</strong></a><br><p>The latest hearing of cases against Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other group leaders was held in Quetta District Jail instead of an anti-terrorism court (ATC), it emerged on Sunday, with the advocacy group terming the development a “disturbing display of institutionalised repression”.
The BYC, a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018, posted in a statement on X that the judicial remand of the detained BYC leaders was further extended for ten days.
 






Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO) in March and have remained in custody since then, being remanded multiple times.
Israr Baloch, the counsel for Mahrang, confirmed Saturday’s developments to Dawn.com. The case was heard by Judge Muhammad Ali Mobin of ATC-1, he said.
“Instead of presenting the BYC leaders in ATC-1, the BYC legal team was summoned to District Jail Quetta, where the cases were heard,” Israr said.
“During the hearing, the prosecutor could not submit the challan, due to which the charges could not be framed against the detained BYC leader and nor could a formal trial be initiated,” he added.
The hearing was adjourned until October 18 and Judge Mobin ordered the prosecution to submit a challan by then, he said.
Earlier, the BYC said in its X post that the shift to “jail hearings marks a grave and deliberate attempt to suppress transparency, exclude public scrutiny, and further institutionalise the criminalisation of peaceful political dissent in Balochistan.
“By moving the proceedings behind prison walls, the state effectively bars families, journalists, and neutral observers from witnessing the process which is a direct violation of Pakistan’s own constitution and international standards on fair trial and due process.”
BYC leaders’ arrest
Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-10-12 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/121941323f1526e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948430/fc-hawaldar-martyred-soldier-injured-as-terrorists-target-security-convoy-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>FC hawaldar martyred, soldier injured as terrorists target security convoy in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>A Frontier Corps (FC) hawaldar was martyred and an FC soldier was injured when a police and security forces convoy was “attacked by terrorists” on the Miranshah Road in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, according to police.
Kashif Nawaz Khan, the spokesperson for Bannu police, confirmed these details to Dawn.com.
He said an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated in the area while a police team and security personnel were conducting a search operation, following which “terrorists attacked the security personnel with weapons”.
“The IED was planted near the Baran Shah bridge on the Miranshah road,” the spokesperson said, adding that “Hawaldar Dost Muhammad Khan was martyred and soldier Shamim Khan injured in the incident.”
The spokesperson said police and security personnel repulsed the attack and “forced the terrorists to flee toward the mountains”.
He further stated that another search operation was launched in the area after the incident.
Four children injured
The police spokesperson also shared details of a quadcopter attack, in which four children were injured.
The children were injured when a quadcopter struck a house in the Khudri Mamand Khel area of Bannu this evening when a “quadcopter piloted by militants” struck a house in the area, he said.
“The injured children have been moved to District Headquarters Hospital Bannu for treatment and are now out of danger,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the children were all from the same family and aged between 8 and 13.</p><small>2025-10-12 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/121333420b658a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948389/motorways-to-islamabad-opened-as-tlp-protesters-remain-camped-in-muridke' target='_blank'><strong>Motorways to Islamabad opened as TLP protesters remain camped in Muridke</strong></a><br><p>Authorities on Sunday opened multiple roads across Punjab as Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protesters continued their sit-ins in Muridke and Sadhoke for the third consecutive day, continuing attempts to reach Islamabad to stage a protest in ‘solidarity with Palestinians’.

A day ago, the main TLP procession reached Muridke after breaking through police security, hours after violent clashes in Lahore left over four dozen police personnel injured. The marchers then staged a sit-in at Muridke, blocked by trenches dug along the GT Road.
In an update on Sunday evening, motorway police issued an alert stating that the Sialkot Motorway was now open, but that the roads going from Chowk Yateem to Scheme Morr and Babu Sabu remained closed.
Earlier, authorities reopened the M1, M2 and M3 motorways for traffic on Sunday.
“Citizens can travel on the Swat Expressway, Hazara Motorway and Hakla DI Khan Motorway,” the police said in a traffic alert. “Containers have been removed from all internal and external routes.”
The motorway police concluded the alert by stating that information can be received from their 130 helpline and official social media accounts.
Roads that have been reopened today include parts of Margalla Road, Jinnah Avenue and Seventh Avenue, as well as Korang Road to Bani Gala; Jinnah Road to Park Road; Garden Avenue to Tulip Banquet Hall; Chand Tara Flyover to Club Road (Murree Road); Fazal-i-Haq Road, Nazimuddin Road, Embassy Road; Ninth Avenue from JUP to Shaheen Chowk via internal access from Margalla Road, and others.
TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that protesters remained in Muridke and Sadhoke, saying, “We have not gone further yet.”
While internet service is slow in the area, mobile data services are working, according to citizens.
Meanwhile, the federal government moved over 1,200 paramilitary personnel to Punjab to intercept protesters, who have been marching on the capital from Lahore via GT Road.
Yesterday, police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners, reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas.
The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, the police used force, arresting 90 protesters and seizing sound systems, while others escaped.
Last night, the police also decided to lift some blockades from a few roads.</p><small>2025-10-12 17:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12211235aebd394.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948438/finance-minister-aurangzeb-arrives-in-washington-to-attend-imf-world-bank-plenary-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>Finance Minister Aurangzeb arrives in Washington to attend IMF, World Bank plenary meetings</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb reached Washington on Sunday, where he will attend plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) from Oct 13 to 18.
The meetings bring together global finance ministers, central bankers and development leaders, offering Pakistan a crucial platform to secure the next IMF tranche, advance economic reforms, and engage international partners on growth, investment, and resilience.
Aurangzeb’s visit comes after a IMF mission concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement (SLA).
Before leaving for the US, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised next week during his visit to Washington.
Separately, Pakistani officials in Washington told media representatives that during the 2025 annual meetings, the delegation from Islamabad would focus on securing the third IMF tranche, meeting the remaining programme benchmarks and presenting verified flood-related loss estimates, with provincial contributions aligned to federal targets.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its review for the country.
A member of the IMF since 1950, Pakistan has entered over twenty lending arrangements with it, reflecting both its need for external support and the IMF’s stabilising role during crises.
Similarly, the WB has supported Pakistan in energy, transport, human capital, social protection, and climate resilience projects.
During Aurangzeb’s meetings in Washington, WB projects on climate adaptation, digitalisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) along with infrastructure development, and engaging investors and rating agencies to strengthen confidence in Pakistan’s economic management will come under discussion.
The minister is also scheduled to participate in a regional round table meeting on the digital transformation of Pakistan’s tax system, organised by the WB.
Islamabad’s long-standing engagements with the two institutions have been providing vital assistance to Pakistan, though they require the country to meet challenging fiscal and structural conditions.
Outcomes from these discussions, particularly the SLA with the IMF, will be key to sustaining economic stability and guiding the country’s growth trajectory in the coming year.
The annual meetings of these international institutions are the world’s leading forums for addressing global economic challenges, financial stability and development strategies. They provide Pakistan with a platform to demonstrate reform commitment, secure multilateral support, and signal stability to investors and international partners.
Pakistan’s participation in these meetings is particularly significant as it seeks to implement structural reforms, manage fiscal and debt pressures, and reassure investors and multilateral lenders of its policy credibility.
Aurangzeb’s engagements
Earlier, the finance ministry shared details of Aurangzeb’s engagements in Washington, which include 65 meetings and official engagements, according to state-run APP.
He is expected to hold meetings with senior officials of the IMF, WB, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
Moreover, he is expected to meet WB President Ajay Banga in a one-on-one session and attend a dinner hosted by Banga for finance ministers of selected countries. He would also meet IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva during engagements on the sidelines of meetings of the G24 and MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) countries, where he would deliver a keynote address.
He would take part in two events hosted by the World Economic Forum and hold bilateral meetings with finance ministers of China, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and Azerbaijan.
His schedule also includes meetings with senior White House officials, members of the US Congress including the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee and representatives from the US State Department, Treasury Department and the International Development Finance Corporation.
He will also engage with the US-Pakistan Business Council to discuss investment opportunities and meet global credit rating agencies and commercial and investment banks, particularly those from the Middle East.
In addition to his other engagements, the finance minister is also expected to give interviews to selected international and US media outlets during the visit.</p><small>2025-10-12 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12163412d98e663.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948406/rana-sanaullah-urges-pti-to-join-charter-for-stable-pakistan-for-sake-of-country-armed-forces-and-martyrs' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah urges PTI to join ‘charter for stable Pakistan’ for sake of country, armed forces, and martyrs</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Sunday urged the PTI and other political parties to unite in backing the “charter for a stable Pakistan”, saying the initiative had become more crucial than ever following last night’s border escalation with Afghanistan.
According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), overnight skirmishes between Kabul and Islamabad erupted on the night of Oct 11-12, after “Afghan Taliban and India-backed militants launched an unprovoked attack along the Pak-Afghan border”. Pakistan said its forces responded decisively, killing over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, while 23 Pakistani soldiers were martyred.
Islamabad has repeatedly urged Afghanistan to rein in the Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for militants linked to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — saying the group operates from Afghan soil. Kabul, however, has denied any involvement.
Speaking during a media briefing in Faisalabad today, Sanaullah said that given the current circumstances, when the country’s stability was more important than anything else, all political parties needed to adopt a unified stance.
“At this moment, I say to the PTI leadership: you may continue to criticise us and chant slogans against the government by all means, but you must stand with Pakistan, with its armed forces, and with its martyrs,” he said.
“If you stand with Pakistan and the armed forces, a way forward will open for you.”
PTI has opposed renewed military operations, arguing they have repeatedly failed to curb terrorism and only displaced civilians, fuelling resentment in affected areas. The party insists militancy should be tackled through dialogue and governance reforms rather than force, warning that fresh offensives without a political strategy could further destabilise Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A day earlier, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security.”
Sanaullah said at this crucial hour, political leadership should fulfil its responsibility, and invited other parties to join the ‘charter for a stable Pakistan’, or ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, as well, a concept introduced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to lay the basis for the greater national interest.
“I call upon all political parties, political leaders and all parliamentarians — whether members of the provincial assemblies, members of the National Assembly or the Senate.
“I invite and appeal to them to accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s request that he made on Independence Day that we should back the charter.”
He said national consolidation had become more important than ever before due to the circumstances. “Come and unite on the ‘charter for stable Pakistan’, and discuss the proposals that the prime minister has put forward,” he stressed.
Talking about the escalation with Afghan Taliban forces, he said: “Today, we have dealt a blow to a disgraced and hidden enemy. We have given the enemy, one that was apparently attacking us from the shadows, a crushing answer.”
He said that because of the Field Marshal Asim Munir’s courageous policy and the bravery of the armed forces, “the whole nation witnessed this honourable moment which they had not seen in some 78 years.”
‘TLP should call off protest’
Meanwhile, Sanaullah also urged Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to call off its protest in the wider interest of the country.
Last week, the party began a march towards Islamabad from Lahore to express ‘solidarity with Palestinians.’ Protesters broke through security and engaged in violent clashes, leaving over four dozen police personnel injured.
The marchers have since camped at Muridke, with their way forward blocked by trenches dug along the GT Road.
“You should postpone this protest, bring it to an end,“ Sanaullah said. “The Gaza march, in fact, is at a time when the issue has, to a considerable extent, indeed to a very large extent, been resolved through diplomatic efforts, and that one-sided slaughter that was taking place there is about to end.”
He said that the march should have been an expression of solidarity with the present government of Pakistan and, in particular, with Field Marshal Munir and PM Shehbaz.
“[You should express solidarity with] the courage with which Pakistan presented its position at the UN and condemned the atrocities being committed against the Palestinian people,” he said.
“Even Europe couldn’t persuade the US, but it is Pakistan’s leadership that called on the US to perform its role and to end this one-sided killing.”
He said that since the protest had turned violent, it was time to call it off.
“A situation has emerged where all senior religious leaders, especially Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI-F, have shown concern,” he said.
“You may not listen to us [the government], but your respected leader [Khadim Hussain Rizvi] always stood with the country; therefore, you should call this off.”</p><small>2025-10-12 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1220072550da749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948433/pm-shehbaz-to-visit-egypt-tomorrow-will-attend-signing-ceremony-of-pact-aimed-at-ending-grave-situation-in-gaza-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to visit Egypt tomorrow, will attend signing ceremony of pact aimed at ending ‘grave situation in Gaza’: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office said on Sunday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would visit Egypt tomorrow (Monday) to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of the peace agreement aimed at ending the “prevailing grave situation in Gaza”.
“At the invitation of the president of Egypt, HE Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, and the president of the United States, HE Donald Trump, the prime minister of Pakistan, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, will visit Egypt on October 13, 2025 to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of the peace agreement aimed at ending the prevailing grave situation in Gaza,” the FO statement said.
The prime minister would be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, as well as other senior ministers during the visit, it added.
The summit is taking place amid positive signs of Palestinians getting respite from the two-year-long Israeli onslaught. During this period, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed and the toll continues to rise as more bodies are recovered.
It comes after US President Trump mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan.
 
 

The FO statement today also underscored this, stating: “The Sharm el-Sheikh Summit is the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month.
“The prime minister of Pakistan, along with the leaders of seven Arab-Islamic countries (Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Indonesia, and Turkiye), attended a summit-level meeting with the president of the United States on September 23, 2025 to explore avenues for achieving peace in Gaza.”
The FO further recalled that through a joint statement, these Arab-Islamic countries “welcomed President Trump’s efforts to achieve peace and reaffirmed their joint commitment to work with the United States to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and to address the critical humanitarian conditions in Gaza”.
It added that PM Shehbaz’s participation in the summit in Egypt, “reflects Pakistan’s historic, consistent, and unwavering support for the just cause of the Palestinian people for their right to self-determination as well as for achieving lasting peace and stability in the region”.
“Pakistan hopes that the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit will pave the way for full Israeli withdrawal, protection of Palestinian civilians, an end to their displacement, release of prisoners, addressing of the prevailing grave humanitarian situation, as well as reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan also hopes that such efforts will contribute to a credible political process aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in line with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO statement said.
Trump, along with his Egyptian counterpart Sisi, will chair the Monday summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations.
The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office said.
It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit.
French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices.
The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media.
Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit.

Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
According to the notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “Section 144 is imposed to prevent all kinds of protests, demonstrations, sit-ins, and rallies and assemblies of more than five persons throughout the Sindh Province, for a period of one month.
“The Government of Sindh is satisfied that in order to maintain law & order situation and to prevent miscreants from assembly in a manner prejudicial to public safety in the province of Sindh, it is necessary to take immediate measures.”
It added that the concerned police stations were given the authority to register complaints under Section 188 of the PPC (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) against people violating the ban.
The notification was issued after the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad to express ‘solidarity with Palestinians’, after clashing with the police in Lahore on Friday.
The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures. At present, the group is camped at Muridke.</p><small>2025-10-12 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12175835e6be369.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948370/pakistan-recover-to-313-5-after-south-africa-strike-back-in-first-test' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan recover to 313-5 after South Africa strike back in first Test</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan rode on a brilliant 93 from Imam-ul-Haq to reach 313-5 after a brief fightback from South Africa on the opening day of the first Test in Lahore on Sunday.
Shan Masood hit 76, but Haq missed out on his hundred as Pakistan slumped to 199-5 as four wickets fell quickly.
Mohammad Rizwan, 62 not out, and Salman Agha, unbeaten 52 at the close, rebuilt the innings during an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 114 in the final session on a spin-friendly Gaddafi Stadium pitch.
Rizwan hit two fours and two sixes in his 12th Test half-century while Agha had two fours and a six in reaching his 10th fifty.
Pakistan dominated most of the first two sessions, but then had a mini-
collapse from 163-1 to 199-5 as they lost four wickets for 36 runs, the last three without adding a run either side of the tea interval.
Spinner Prenelan Subrayen trapped Masood lbw for 76, including nine fours and a six, to end a 161-run stand with Haq.
Left-arm spinner Senuran Muthusamy then had Haq caught at short-leg by Tony de Zorzi, after a 236-minute knock that included seven fours and a six.
Next ball — the last before tea — Muthusamy had Saud Shakeel caught and bowled to bring South Africa back into the game at 199-4.
Local hero Babar Azam fell for 23, trapped leg-before by off-spinner Simon Harmer after the interval to make it 199-5 and leave a good 10,000 holiday crowd disappointed.
South Africa could have been in a better position had they not dropped Masood on 61 and Haq on 72 with Subrayen the unlucky bowler on both occasions.
With the pitch likely to turn, Masood opted to bat after winning the toss and named specialist spin duo Noman Ali and Sajid Khan in the team Pakistan lost opener Abdullah Shafique leg before to pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada off the third ball of the day.
South African captain Aiden Markram turned to his spinners in the sixth over and by lunch had used all three — Subrayen, Harmer and Muthusamy.
But there were no further dramas in the opening session as Pakistan reached 107-1 at lunch after Haq had brought up his 10th Test fifty.
The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June.
The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June.
The Shan Masood-led hosts, who finished an embarrassing last in the nine-team table of the 2023-25 WTC, must raise their game significantly in all departments if they are to resist Aiden Markram-captained tourists who claimed their maiden WTC crown by beating Australia in the final at Lord’s last year.
The Gaddafi Stadium did not host any Test in the previous WTC cycle after the venue was used for the third and final Test between Pakistan and Australia in March 2022. South Africa, on their last tour to Pakistan in 2021, lost a two-Test series 2-0.
While both the captains expected a spin-friendly track at the Gaddafi Stadium, there were doubts over the inclusion of key Pakistan off-spinner Sajid, who was suffering from a viral infection but did practise with the team yesteday.
Ahead of the game, Shan said taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the Test series. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked.
In his presser, Markram acknowledged Pakistan’s plan to prepare spinning pitches at home and said that his players were ready for the challenge. “As a team not heavily exposed to these conditions, it is going to be exciting and a great opportunity for us to get things right here.”

Pakistan: Shan Masood (captain), Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan

The decision against Butt comes against the backdrop of AFP seeking reasons behind a sharp decline in Arshad’s performance where he finished 10th in the men’s javelin final at the World Athletics Champ­ionship held in Tokyo last month.
In his reply to AFP, Butt said that it was due to the heat and humidity in the Japanese capital as well as a calf pain that Arshad couldn’t perform up to his usual standards.
According to a press release issued by AFP, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com,  the federation in its executive committee meeting held on October 10 under the chairmanship of AFP president Wajahat Hussain Sahi, “has taken significant disciplinary and administrative decisions to uphold transparency, constitutional compliance, and organizational integrity within the Federation.
“After careful review and deliberation, the Executive Committee imposed a lifetime ban on Salman Butt, former office bearer of the Punjab Athletics Association (PAA), for gross violations of the AFP Constitution, on which he himself is a signatory,” the press release stated.
“Butt is henceforth barred for life from participating in any athletics activity —whether as an athlete, coach, official, or office bearer — at both national and international levels, inside or outside Pakistan.
Similarly, Habib Shah, former secretary of the Punjab Athletics Association, has been banned for 10 years from participation in any athletics-related activity in any capacity at national or international level, the press release stated.
“The executive committee further declared the Punjab Athletics Association’s purported elections held on August 31, 2025 as illegal, unconstitutional, and null and void ab initio.
“These elections were announced at midnight on August 29 merely two days before being held, whereas the AFP Constitution clearly requires a minimum 21-days notice prior to convening an electoral meeting, and a seven-days notice for submission of nomination papers by candidates wishing to contest elections.
“It was also noted with concern that even the senior vice president of the Punjab Athletics Association was unaware of the election schedule until August 30, just one day before the elections.
“This fact further demonstrates the complete lack of transparency and violation of procedural and constitutional norms in the conduct of these elections,” the press release stated.
It added: “The Executive Committee termed these actions as a deliberate attempt to undermine the Constitution of AFP and affirmed that such practices will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“To rectify the situation, the Committee has constituted a Management Committee headed by Madam Shahida Khanum, senior vice President AFP to hold fair, transparent, and constitutionally valid elections of the Punjab Athletics Association at the earliest.”
The committee will also run the routine affairs of the association until the completion of the new election process, the press release stated.
“The president and executive committee of the Athletics Federation of Pakistan have reiterated their firm stance that all affairs of the Federation shall be governed strictly in accordance with its constitution.
“No individual or group will be allowed to violate or bypass constitutional provisions. The AFP remains fully committed to ensuring integrity, unity, and discipline for the promotion of athletics and welfare of athletes across Pakistan.”
Speaking to Dawn.com in a phone call, AFP president Wajahat Sahi said that the PAA informed them about the elections on August 29 at 11:39pm.
“On August 30, AFP informed the PAA that these elections will be considered illegal,” Sahi told Dawn.com.
“Till August 30, even the senior vice president of AFP did not know about the elections being held on August 31.”
According to Sahi, Butt was no longer president of PAA after August 6, which was the original date scheduled for the PAA elections.
Sahi added that Butt was supposedly contesting for president once again.
Dawn.com contacted Butt for comment but was unable to get in touch with him.
“Ultimately, the  inquiry committee completed their investigation and recommended severe disciplinary action against these people,” Sahi said.
“AFP is working for the nation and country and to bring glory, which was proved at the Paris Olympics by winning gold,” Sahi said.
“This is a decades long effort of AFP, particularly the president at the time, Akram Sahi. They got this laurel for the country, which has unfortunately been wasted and ruined by some people.
“We will uphold the constitution of AFP, and steps taken are as per the law,” Sahi said.
He added that Butt has the right to appeal the lifetime ban, as per the constitution.
Butt was appointed by AFP as Arshad’s coach after the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, where Arshad finished fifth in the men’s javelin final. Since then, he has coached Arshad to several accolades, including a gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, a silver at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, and gold at the Paris 2024 Olympics.</p><small>2025-10-12 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12081907fbadc68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948281/furore-over-absence-of-women-journalists-from-afghan-fm-muttaqis-presser-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Furore over absence of women journalists from Afghan FM Muttaqi’s presser in India</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi: India’s opposition Congress party criticised the Narendra Modi government on Saturday over the absence of women journalists from a press conference addressed by visiting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asking the prime minister to clarify his position on the matter.
“Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space.
“Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti,” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X.
Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted.
 






“Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X.
The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent.
Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
 






Taliban decision
While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister.
Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees.
“(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X.
 






Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).”
 






Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind.
“To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.”
Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added.
 






The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul.
While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns.
“Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy. India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghan­is­tan. Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience. To enha­nce that, I am pleased to anno­u­nce today the upgrading of India’s technical mission in Kabul to the status of embassy of India.”

On Friday, Trump responded to Beijing’s most recent export controls by imposing additional tariffs of 100 per cent on China’s US-bound exports, along with new export controls on critical software by November 1.
The revived trade tensions have rattled Wall Street, sending Big Tech shares tumbling, worried foreign companies dependent on China’s production of processed rare earths and rare earth magnets, and could derail a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping tentatively scheduled for later this month.
Responding to Trump
The Chinese commerce ministry’s statement on Sunday was Beijing’s first direct response to Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Friday, where he accused Beijing of suddenly raising trade tensions after an uneasy truce was reached six months ago between the world’s two largest economies, allowing them to trade goods without sky-high tariff rates.
 






“Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” Trump said.
The commerce ministry said in an equally lengthy statement that its export controls on rare-earth elements followed a series of US measures since bilateral trade talks in Madrid last month.
Beijing cited the addition of Chinese companies to a US trade blacklist and Washington’s imposition of port fees on China-linked ships as examples.
“The US actions have severely harmed China’s interests and undermined the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks, and China is resolutely opposed to them,” the ministry said.
Beijing stopped short of explicitly connecting these US actions to its export curbs on rare-earth elements, saying its curbs were motivated by concern about these materials’ military applications at a time of “frequent military conflicts”.
It also held off on announcing a corresponding levy on China-bound US imports, unlike earlier in the year, when both superpowers progressively ratcheted up tariffs on each other until the US rate was 145pc while China’s was 125pc.
“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the commerce ministry said, adding China would take corresponding measures if the US did not correct its course.
Path of Negotiations
China’s decision not to immediately respond in kind to Trump’s opening salvo in this latest round of trade tensions could leave the door open for both countries to negotiate a de-escalation, analysts said.
“By clarifying the rationale behind its retaliatory measures, Beijing is also outlining a potential path forward for negotiations. The ball is now in the US court,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at strategic advisory firm GreenPoint.
But Hutong Research said in a note on Saturday that if Beijing chooses not to respond to Trump’s 100pc tariff hike, it may signal that Beijing no longer prioritises a long-term deal with him, reflecting diminished confidence in his ability to restrain hawks or stick to commitments.
“Key watchpoints now: Whether Beijing moves to freeze or complicate the TikTok sale, given its political symbolism. Proceeding with the sale under current conditions would be seen as a major concession,” the research firm said.
China says export controls are not export bans
The commerce ministry also countered Trump’s narrative that China was using its dominance in processed rare earths and rare earth magnets to attack all countries, not just the US.
“We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump said on Friday on Truth Social.
China produces over 90pc of the world’s processed rare earths and rare earth magnets. The 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.
Exports of 12 of them are restricted after China’s commerce ministry on Thursday added five — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — along with related materials.
The commerce ministry statement on Sunday sought to reassure foreign companies spooked by the latest export curbs, promising to promote compliant trade by granting general licenses and license exemptions.
“China’s export controls are not export bans,” it said. “Any export applications for civilian use that comply with regulations will be approved, and relevant enterprises need not worry.”</p><small>2025-10-12 08:29</small></div><hr>
