Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.
“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement.







“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.
But in late November, she was rushed to hospital, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.
During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.
BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to AFP.
Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.
She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.
There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.
Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.
Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.
‘Battling begums’
Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.
Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.
She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.
Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.
Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.
In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.
In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.
Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.
Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.
In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.
Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.
In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.
Detention and freedom
Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.
The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.
Khaleda never regained power.
With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.
Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.
In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.
She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.
Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.
In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</p><small>2025-12-30 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30075445e07a105.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964051/indias-chenab-dam-plan-riles-eco-activists-pakistan-alike' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Chenab dam plan riles eco-activists, Pakistan alike</strong></a><br><p>• Environment ministry okays ‘run-of-the-river’ Dulhasti Stage II, to be built in held Kashmir• Indian govt forging ahead with several hydel projects in Indus basin after unilaterally suspending treaty• Water weaponisation in climate change-prone region ‘neither sane nor acceptable’, warns Sherry Rehman
NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology.
Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu.
Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river.
The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.
The projects
The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over.
The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million.
According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.”
The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported.
Environmental concerns
The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change.
Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab.
From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc.
This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”.
“Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.”
In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them.
Sherry expresses alarm
While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”.
In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
“As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said.







“Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said.
“This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said.

In a media briefing after a cabinet meeting here, Mr Jan said that the PTI delegation comprising provincial ministers and members of the assembly and led by CM Afridi, which just concluded a visit to Punjab province to launch a street movement, achieved its objectives as restrictions prevented people from freely moving with PTI flags on Lahore roads.
He said the love of Punjab residents for the PTI was evident from the warm welcome accorded to the delegation on arrival in Lahore.
The chief minister’s aide regretted that the chief minister was denied permission to visit the houses of some PTI workers in the cantonment area.

CM tells cabinet that funding denial by Centre has badly hit uplift projects in tribal districts

He wondered if a chief minister’s entry to the cantonment area could be stopped, how a mob entered the Lahore corps commander’s house on May 9, 2023.
Mr Jan condemned the Punjab government’s conduct towards the KP chief minister during the Punjab visit.
“Curfew was imposed; roads were blocked;all those who invited the PTI team to their areas, were arrested and even members of the Christian community, who were celebrating Christmas, were taken into custody and bundled into a prison van before being taken away,” he said.
Mr Jan accused Punjab Minister for Information Azma Bukhari of allowing nine YouTubers entry to the Punjab Assembly and refusing the same to “genuine” journalists.
He said that the chief minister had ordered an inquiry into the “extra-judicial“ killing of two Swat residents in Gujranwala.
To a question, the aide to the CM said the provincial government wouldn’t allow new military operations in the province.
Earlier in the cabinet meeting, CM Afridi complained about the denial of the Accelerated Implementation Programme‘s funds to the Centre by the Centre, saying the long delays in the release of funding have severely hit work on development projects in the merged tribal districts, according to an official statement.
The chief minister said the federal government owed Rs4.758 trillion to KP and that the finance ministry tried to hold a media trial of the provincial government on the issue of fiscal releases through false propaganda.
He demanded that the federal government disclose complete details of funds released to all provinces and present a comparison of KP’s dues with those of other provinces and directed all departments to write formal letters regarding the outstanding payments and obtain written responses.
The cabinet approved the establishment of Takaful companies in the province in line with Islamic principles, according to Mr Jan.
He said the KP General Takaful Company and KP Family Takaful Company would be established, with Rs2 billion approved for the former and Rs3bn for the latter.
According to him, the General Takaful Company will cover health and other risk-related matters, while the Family Takaful Company will provide financial support to families in the event of the death of the family head.
The cabinet approved a supplementary grant of Rs3.825 ttrillion for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Safe Cities Projects for Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Waziristan districts.
The aide to the CM said significant progress had been made on the Peshawar Safe City project, with 80 per cent of work completed on “some targets“ and over 50pc on others, while work on safe city projects in other cities was under way.
He said recommendations of the cabinet committee regarding the merger of the posts of risaldar and dafadar in the former Fata were laid before the meeting, which granted “nomenclature approval” to 16 remaining posts. These posts will be merged with police after the fulfillment of rules and regulations, according to him.
The cabinet approved the framework as per the prevailing conditions for maintaining the quota system for students from the erstwhile Fata in medical and other educational institutions on a merit basis after dividing South Waziristan into two districts.
It also granted approval to the establishment of a KP cell for the National Finance Commission in the Small Industrial Development Board Plaza in Islamabad, reconstitution of the KP Trade Testing Board, and Rs199 million funding for security and other development needs around the Rashakai CPEC Economic Zone.
The cabinet accepted the proposal to grant Rs168 million to the KP Education Foundation besides budget estimates of the KP Housing Authority and the purchase of four Rs49 million vehicles for the Mansehra Gravity Water Supply Scheme.
It approved financial assistance to compensate owners of rickshaws, petrol pumps, shops, vehicles, flour mills and factories for losses incurred during the 2025 flashfloods.
The cabinet allowed authorities to launch a three-year Ehsaas Education Internship Programme with an initial allocation of Rs207 million for the current year to provide 850 talented youth with internship opportunities in schools every year.
It also approved new mechanisms for contracts for five outsourced hospitals, a special compensation package for those martyred and injured in the Pakistan-India war and an Rs1 million civilian victim compensation package for Shaheed Noor Rahman, son of former member of the United Ulema Board, Shaheed Mufti Fazl Rahman.
Amendments to the Rules of Business of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service Commission were also approved during the cabinet meeting, according to the statement.

ISLAMABAD: The telecom industry has demanded rational conditions in the spectrum auction policy expected to be announced by the federal cabinet in the coming days, suggesting that the government needs to prioritise long-term economic benefits over short-term revenue generation.
Telecom companies say spectrum is an invisible infrastructure but a crucial one as it drives digital connectivity — the foundation of modern life.
Financial technology adoption, freelancer platforms, and digital tools used by schools and hospitals all depend on mobile broadband capacity.
However, the problem is that while the demand for connectivity has surged in the country, spectrum availability remains scarce.
Currently, Pakistan has just 274 MHz of spectrum allocated nationwide, resulting in slow internet speeds, poor service quality, and limited innovation — constraining households, businesses and government institutions alike.
‘Economic realities’
Aamir Ibrahim, chief executive officer of Jazz, emphasised that Pakistan’s upcoming spectrum auction must reflect the economic realities of the telecom sector.
“Since operators earn in Pakistani rupees, spectrum pricing and payment structures should also be denominated in the same currency to ease financial pressure and accelerate network rollout,” he said in a statement.
Mr Ibrahim added that a pragmatic, long-term approach aligned with national objectives, similar to the PIA auction model, was essential to deliver affordable internet at scale and unlock Pakistan’s digital future.
Greater spectrum availability will also support freelancers, who contributed $400 million in remittances between July 2024 and March 2025 but remain constrained by unstable internet connectivity.
Nearly two-fifths of the country’s adult population remains financially excluded, as digital banking and microfinance services cannot scale without reliable connectivity.
Telecom operators also struggle with an average revenue per user of $1, which is one of the lowest globally, limiting their ability to reinvest in infrastructure.
‘Foundational reform’
The government’s recognition of this bottleneck and its decision to release more than 600 MHz of new spectrum is “therefore as a foundational reform”. It aligns with national digital goals and supports emerging technologies such as AI and the Internet of Things (IoT).
“The issue is no longer whether Pakistan needs more spectrum; it is how the auction is structured to accelerate digital progress,” the statement read. “The GSMA analysis shows that a two-year delay in releasing new spectrum could cost Pakistan $1.8 billion in GDP, while a five-year delay could exceed $4.3bn,” it added.
It warned that a “misaligned policy now means lost jobs, weaker exports and slower innovation”.
Mr Ibrahim stressed that spectrum pricing and policy must reflect domestic realities and national interest. “Clarity on future spectrum availability is essential to restore investor confidence, encourage competition and accelerate infrastructure deployment,” he added.
Rollout obligations, he continued, must prioritise imp­roved customer experience, wider rural access and service quality standards that empower the country’s digital economy.
“These are not concessions but economic enablers that turn spectrum from a one-time revenue stream into a productive long-term national asset,” he said.
“Every additional MHz carries measurable benefits for productivity, innovation, and inclusion.”
Successful test
Meanwhile, as 5G services are set to be launched in Pakistan, Zong and Huawei have successfully tested ultra-high-capacity backhaul technology to meet the growing data traffic in the country.
According to a statement, Zong, in collaboration with Huawei, completed Pakistan’s first field test of a full-duplex E-band microwave link.
With rapidly growing data demand driven by high-definition video streaming, augmented reality, cloud services and low-latency applications, traditional microwave backhaul solutions are facing increasing spectrum constraints.
The full-duplex E-band solution directly addresses these challenges, enabling next-generation network performance.
While the traditional microwave solutions are limited by spectrum resources, the new technology uses high-isolation integrated antenna structures and advanced interference cancellation algorithms to simultaneously send and receive data on the same frequency, double the spectrum efficiency — with a data transmission capacity of up to 50 Gbps per link.
“This innovative technology will be deployed in future network infrastructure, enabling Zong to offer faster, more reliable, and scalable connectivity services, providing users with a smoother and more stable network experience,” the statement read.
Zong’s Chief Technology Officer Mao Weiliang said ultra-high-capacity backhaul solutions were a foundation for Pakistan’s digital future.
“This advancement will support emerging technologies, enhance user experience, and contribute directly to national economic growth and digital inclusion,” Mr Mao added.
The company added that with the successful test, Zong had become the first operator in Pakistan to deploy full-duplex E-band technology, reinforcing its role in the country’s digital transformation.

The US president will push the Israeli leader to move to the next stage of his fragile Gaza truce plan.
Netanyahu is also expected to try to shift some focus onto Iran, amid reports he will call for more US strikes on the Islamic republic’s nuclear program.
The meeting, the fifth between the two leaders to be held in the United States this year, comes as some White House officials fear both Israel and Hamas are slow-walking the second phase of their ceasefire.
Trump, who said Netanyahu had asked for the talks, is reportedly keen to announce as soon as January a Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza, and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.
Netanyahu’s office said he met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in Florida ahead of his talks with Trump, which are scheduled for 1pm (1800 GMT).
Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian said Netanyahu would discuss ensuring that “Hamas is disarmed, Gaza is demilitarized” in the second phase of the agreement.
He will also bring up the “danger Iran poses not only to the region of the Middle East, but the United States as well,” Bedrosian said.
Hamas’s armed wing, however, reiterated on Monday that it would not surrender its weapons - one of the key sticking points in the talks.
“Our people are defending themselves and will not give up their weapons as long as the occupation remains,” the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said in a video message.
It also confirmed the death of their longtime spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza on August 30.
‘Phase two has to begin’
Netanyahu’s visit caps a frantic few days of international diplomacy in Palm Beach, where Trump hosted Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday for talks on ending Russia’s invasion.
The Gaza ceasefire in October is one of the major achievements of Trump’s first year back in power, but his administration and regional mediators want to keep up the momentum.
The first phase of the truce deal stipulated that Hamas release the remaining hostages, both dead and alive, taken during its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The group has so far returned all the living captives and the remains of all but one.
Under the second stage, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, while Hamas is supposed to lay down its weapons.
An interim authority is meanwhile meant to govern the Palestinian territory, and the international stabilization force (ISF) is to be deployed.
Both sides, however, have alleged frequent ceasefire violations.
‘Frustrated with Netanyahu’
The Axios news outlet reported on Friday that Trump wanted to convene the first meeting of a new Gaza “Board of Peace” that he will chair at the Davos forum in Switzerland in January.
But it said that senior White House officials were growing exasperated with what they viewed as efforts by Netanyahu to stall the peace process.
“There are more and more signs that the American administration is getting frustrated with Netanyahu,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at London-based think tank Chatham House.
The Israeli and US administrations are increasingly at odds on many key issues, including Israel’s continued strikes on Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in Syria.
On Iran, Israeli officials and media have expressed concern in recent months that Iran is rebuilding its ballistic missile arsenal after it came under attack during the 12-day war with Israel in June.
But Sina Toossi, a researcher at the Center for International Policy (CIP) in Washington, said Trump’s insistence that US strikes in June destroyed Tehran’s nuclear program had “removed Israel’s most powerful historical justification for US support for war with Iran.”
Netanyahu’s new focus on Iran’s missiles is “an effort to manufacture a replacement casus belli,” Toossi told AFP.
Iran on Monday denounced the reports as a “psychological operation” against Tehran, emphasizing it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warning renewed aggression would “result in harsher consequences” for Israel.</p><small>2025-12-29 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29205401d196d45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963941/eight-year-old-dies-in-karachis-korangi-after-falling-into-uncovered-manhole' target='_blank'><strong>Eight-year-old dies in Karachi’s Korangi after falling into uncovered manhole</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An eight-year-old child died on Monday after he fell into an uncovered manhole while playing outside his house in Karachi’s Korangi area, said police.
Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.
The latest victim, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn.
The child’s relatives rushed to the spot, but were unable to save him. By the time the body was recovered, the child had died. SSP Janwari, along with other officials, later visited the spot where the accident happened and met the bereaved family.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities.
According to data released by the Edhi Foundation, 27 people died in Karachi in 2025 after falling into open manholes and nullahs.
In Karachi, responsibilities for drains, roads, footpaths, sewerage, water supply and public safety are divided among the KMC, 25 town municipal corporations, around 250 union committees, the KDA, the water and sewerage corporation, cantonment boards, the Sindh government and private utilities.
The city is run by a patchwork of authorities that rarely coordinate, and often contradict one another.</p><small>2025-12-29 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29224257e58c912.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963946/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-religious-alliance-risking-its-future' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over religious alliance, risking its future</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.
At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.
The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12.
Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.
“The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.”
‘Alliance for greater unity’
The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP.
With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution.
An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.
The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.
NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.
“The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27.
“This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.”
Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.
‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’
Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.
One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.
“I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook.
“Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.”
Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”.
“If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”</p><small>2025-12-29 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/291841107bf55dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963936/major-martyred-5-terrorists-killed-during-ibo-in-kps-bajaur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Major martyred, 5 terrorists killed during IBO in KP’s Bajaur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‘s Bajaur district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
The military identified the martyred officer as 36-year-old Major Adeel Zaman from Dera Ismail Khan.
During the operation, security forces also killed five terrorists, added ISPR.
On December 29, “security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in general area Khar, Bajaur district, on reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij,” it said.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of operation, due to effective engagement by own troops five Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,“ said the statement.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Adeel Zaman (age: 36 years, resident of Dera Ismail Khan District), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.”
The statement further said that security forces recovered weapons and ammunition from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians”.
Following the operation, security forces conducted a sanitisation operation to eliminate other terrorists in the area.
“Relentless Counter-Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added the statement.
Funeral prayers offered
The funeral prayers of Major Adeel were offered at Peshawar Garrison later in the evening. Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, commander Peshawar Corps and other senior military and civil officers were in attendance.
Paying rich tribute to the officer’s sacrifice, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that the “martyrs of Pakistan Army are the pride of the nation and their sacrifices will forever be remembered,” said a statement by the military’s media wing.

“He prayed for the elevation of the Shaheed’s ranks in Jannah and for patience and strength for the family.”
“Major Adeel Zaman Shaheed laid down his life in the line of duty while leading from the front. Pakistan Armed Forces remain resolute in their commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices further strengthen the nation’s resolve,” added the statement.
The martyred officer will be laid to rest at his native town in Dera Ismail Khan.
Last month, at least 22 terrorists were killed and several were injured in Bajaur district during a successful counter-insurgency operation carried out by security forces.
The IBO in Bajaur’s village of Gadar was termed a “major success” by the security sources in a statement and was carried out “based on highly classified information”.
Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.</p><small>2025-12-29 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/292050093aeed63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963944/hamas-confirms-death-of-spokesman-abu-obeida-says-he-was-killed-by-israel-in-august' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas confirms death of spokesman Abu Obeida, says he was killed by Israel in August</strong></a><br><p>Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Monday the death of its spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza.
The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: “We pause in reverence before … the masked man loved by millions … the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida.”
Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30.
During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Palestinians in Gaza, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas’s military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations.







Born on February 11, 1985 and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
He later became the group’s sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh. He had also been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts.
According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as “resistance” and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

“For many years, only a very small circle of Hamas officials knew his true identity,” a Hamas official told AFP.
Israel has decimated Hamas’s leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war.
The video announcing Abu Obeida’s death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson’s distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor’s name for future statements.
In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.</p><small>2025-12-29 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29182017fdd5196.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937/karachi-dhaka-flights-likely-from-january-says-pakistans-high-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi-Dhaka flights likely from January, says Pakistan’s high commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus.
Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka.







“During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader.
Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities.
The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”.
“Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy.
According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”.
The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.”
“Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement.
Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“.
In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with Professor Yunus.
During his landmark visit to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.</p><small>2025-12-29 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29182430cf34362.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963938/in-letter-to-maryam-kp-cm-expresses-deep-concern-over-treatment-meted-out-to-him-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to Maryam, KP CM expresses ‘deep concern’ over treatment meted out to him in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his three-day Lahore visit, stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”.
In a two-page letter, posted on X by the KP government, the Afridi recorded his formal objection to the Punjab government’s conduct, and said, “I write to you with deep concern and strong exception to the manner in which my recent visit to the Province of Punjab was handled, and the events that deliberately unfolded during and after the visit.”







He recalled that the “sequence of actions witnessed was neither accidental nor administrative in nature.
“It reflects conduct that is wholly incompatible with the dignity of constitutional office and the spirit of inter-provincial respect,” he said.
CM Afridi told the Punjab CM that he undertook the visit in his capacity as the chief minister.
“Regrettably, the treatment accorded to me was marked by discourtesy, unnecessary hostility, and protocol deviations that cannot be justified under any accepted standard of inter-provincial engagement,” he said.
Afridi maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”.
He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”.
The KP chief minister further recalled that “even public places, including food streets and markets, were completely sealed, and whole blackouts were affected, venues denied, paining the common citizens of Lahore at this expense”.
“Free access, as provided for in the Constitution, was even denied at Motorway rest areas,” added the letter.
The KP CM also took note of the “coordinated and malicious social media campaign that accompanied and followed“ his visit.
“Serious insinuations- specifically linking with narcotics were injected into public discourse,” Afridi said.
“These allegations were amplified through accounts widely perceived to be aligned with, or operating under the umbrella of, the Government of Punjab,” he alleged.
He continued: “Let me state this clearly: the use of state-linked digital platforms to circulate or amplify defamatory insinuations against a sitting Chief Minister of another province is unacceptable, irresponsible, and institutionally indefensible.”
“Allegations of such gravity cannot be floated through innuendo or suggestion; they require evidence, jurisdiction, and lawful process,” he told the Punjab CM.
“Anything short of that constitutes character assassination,” he added.
KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, excessive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”.
He alleged that the series of events suggested “planning and intent, aimed at humiliation rather than engagement”.
CM Afridi maintained that “such actions undermine federal harmony, erode public trust in provincial institutions, and [set] a dangerous precedent where constitutional officeholders are targeted through insinuation rather than addressed through formal channels.”
He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government“, and stressed that it damaged the ”collective credibility of federating units.“
As he concluded his letter to Maryam, the chief minister stated: “I place on record my strong protest and rejection of the treatment meted out to me and of the defamatory narratives propagated during this episode.”
“I expect that your government will ensure that such conduct — administrative as well as digital — is neither repeated nor normalised, and that accountability is enforced where required,” he said.
Punjab govt‘s conduct ‘undemocratic and reprehensible’
Separately, the KP CM also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the Punjab government during a cabinet meeting today, calling it “undemocratic, reprehensible and contrary to national unity”.







The chief minister condemned the treatment and said, “The way me and my cabinet members were treated, the whole world witnessed it“.
“When the country is going through political and economic instability, such an attitude — at a time when we need national unity — will only fan flames of hatred,“ the chief minister said.
“Violence was perpetrated against cabinet members by the Punjab government, and roads were continuously blocked for a provincial chief minister, markets were forcibly shut down, even motorway rest areas were sealed, and turning off the lights during a visit to Mazar-e-Iqbal is extremely regrettable,” the minister was quoted as saying.
He remarked that “such an attitude — reflecting Punjab government’s moral and intellectual depravity — was condemnable and alarming“.
Afridi noted that the actions were “especially alarming given the instability in the country“ and warned that by continuing with such behaviour, “they were sowing hatred and division”.
“We condemn the attitude in the strongest of words,” he said, adding that hateful attitudes were “detrimental to the country”.
KP CM directed his government officials to be hospitable towards any officials or chief ministers visiting KP from other provinces in accordance with cultural traditions and norms.
During the meeting, the chief minister also highlighted that the Centre had yet to release funds owed to the merged districts of KP under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
“Work remains stalled in our merged districts because of it,” he said, adding that the Centre owed KP Rs4,758 billion.
“It has been more than half a year, and we have not yet received the funds under AIP,” the chief minister said.
“Even the amount that was already committed is not being given,” he added.
Afridi was in Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement. He had arrived on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly.
However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
During his visit, he criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him.
“This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“
Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive.
In a separate incident during his visit, when CM Afridi’s entourage reached Lahore’s Food Street for dinner, all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off, and even the general public was evicted.</p><small>2025-12-29 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29174440741ab07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963932/pti-founder-imran-khan-bushra-bibi-challenge-toshakhana-2-verdict-in-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi challenge Toshakhana 2 verdict in IHC</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, on Monday filed separate appeals with the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging their conviction in the Toshakhana 2 case.
A special court on December 20 sentenced Imran and Bushra to 17 years imprisonment in the case, which pertained to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price.
During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m.
According to copies of the appeal available with Dawn, the couple’s lawyers contended that the sentencing was politically motivated, arguing, “The overarching objective of the present prosecution appears to be the continued incarceration of the appellant, thereby preventing his participation in national politics and curtailing his political role and influence.”
Furthermore, it was noted that the case, initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), had been transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
“The learned trial court overlooked the methodology adopted by the Federal Investigation Agency in conducting the investigation. In the absence of settled law, precedent, or clear guidance on the subject, heightened care and caution were required in interpreting and applying the governing legal framework,” the appeal read.
“Instead, both the investigating agency and the Trial Court proceeded in a cursory manner. This is evident from the absence of any FIR (first information report) on the record.”
The appeals also noted that the FIA submitted a challan “within two days of the initiation of the investigation”, leaving inadequate time to conduct a fair and transparent probe.
It was further noted that the Toshakhana 2 conviction was the fourth prosecution in the Toshakhana cases and constituted double jeopardy, “reflecting a repetitive and overlapping invocation of criminal process in respect of the same subject matter”.
“NAB deliberately chose to bifurcate the prosecution by selectively proceeding in respect of one set of gifts while deferring or abandoning prosecution in respect of the others. Such a course of action is impermissible in law,” the appeals read, noting that Toshakahana 1 and 2 revolved around different gifts.
“The bifurcation of what ought to have been a single, composite trial into multiple proceedings was undertaken with the ulterior motive of ensuring the continued incarceration of the present appellant,” the appeals argued.
Moreover, the appeals stated that the conviction ignored the 2018 Toshakhana policy, with Clause I, mandating that all gifts received shall be duly reported and deposited with the Toshakhana.
Clause VI “provides that gifts valued above Rs30,000 may be retained by the recipient upon payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000”.
The appeals further argued that there was no violation of the Toshakhana policy, as the gifts were deposited and fees to retain the gifts were paid. It further noted that there are no criminal provisions or charges of criminal breach of trust or criminal misconduct envisaged in the policy, making the sentencing unlawful.
“The learned trial judge misread and misapplied the relevant Toshakhana Policy/Rules governing retention of gifts,” the appeals read.
“The prosecution wholly failed to establish the guilt of the appellant and his wife beyond [a] reasonable doubt; however, this fundamental deficiency was entirely overlooked by the learned Special Judge, Central, while recording the conviction.”
Furthermore, the appeals contended that a criminal breach of trust requires the entrustment of property, dishonest misappropriation of such property for the accused’s own use, and in cases falling under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by bank, merchant, or agent) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the accused must be a “public servant”; they contended that Imran and Bushra did not meet these requirements.
“In the present case, the prosecution has failed to establish any of these foundational elements. There was no dishonest misappropriation or conversion, as the gifts were duly retained strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy and Rules after payment of the requisite assessed amount,” the appeals read, arguing that Imran did not fall within the definition of a public servant as per Section 21 of the PPC.
“The learned trial court, in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment, has manifestly faltered in bringing the appellant within the ambit of the definition of a ‘public servant’ by relying upon the ninth description of Section 21 PPC, coupled with vague precedents from 1957 and 1961. This reflects a flawed, incorrect, and legally unsustainable approach,” Imran’s appeal read.
Bushra’s appeal noted that she was “a housewife who has never held, occupied, or performed the functions of any public office”, meaning that the ruling was “coram non judice, without lawful authority, and liable to be set aside in its entirety”.
The appeals requested that the December 20 judgment be set aside and that Imran and Bushra be acquitted of the charges in the Toshakhana 2 case.
Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year, in October, the two had denied all allegations in the case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.</p><small>2025-12-29 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29150929761be5f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963923/lahore-dc-gives-formal-go-ahead-for-3-day-basant-celebrations' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore DC gives formal go-ahead for 3-day Basant celebrations</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore deputy commissioner (DC) gave the formal go-ahead on Monday for celebrating Basant in the district from February 6-8, explaining the terms and conditions, as well as restrictions for the festival and consequences of their violations.
Basant is returning to Lahore after 18 years, the way for which was paved by the passing of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025 by the provincial assembly on December 24.
The legislation authorised deputy commissioners to grant conditional permission for kite-flying — which otherwise remains banned in Punjab — on specified days and at designated locations.
Subsequently, a notification issued by the Lahore DC today said: “In exercise of powers conferred under section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025 and in pursuance of approval of the Government, it is hereby notified that kite-flying is allowed within the territorial limits of District Lahore on the occasion of Basant 2026,” subject to conditions.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, did not specify any particular area for flying kites, implying that the government had allowed festivities across the district.
Notifying the manufacturing, trade and sale of “permissible kite flying material”, the Lahore DC said that the manufacturing and trade of permissible kite flying material will be allowed from Dec 30 to Feb 8, 2026, subject to valid digital registration under Rule 3 of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025 and the regulations thereunder.
The sale of permissible kite flying material to the general public shall be allowed from Feb 1-8, exclusively by the registered sellers in accordance with the notified rules and regulations, the notification said.
The registration for manufacturers, traders or sellers of permissible kite flying material will be opened from Monday (today) through the government’s e-biz app or the festival’s website under the notified rules and regulations, it said.
It also prohibited manufacturers, traders or sellers from manufacturing, trading, storing or selling permissible kite flying material unless registered with the DC’s office under the relevant rules and regulations.
It stated that only such kite flying material, as specified in Schedule-I of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025, was to be manufactured, traded, stored, sold or used during the notified period.
It further directed that the kites should not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length while the gudda should not exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
It also directed that the kite string be made of cotton with no more than nine threads and “no less than 28-count” coated with maanjha (coating) and having a minimum sheesha size of 350 mash. The string is only to be wound in the shape of a pinna (twine balls) and the use of charkhi (spool) is strictly prohibited.
The manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, possession or use of sharp maanjha nylon or plastic cords, metallic wire or any other injurious material coated on the thread has been strictly prohibited.
All registered manufacturers, traders and sellers were directed to clearly display valid registration certificates at approved premises, as required under rule 3(6) of the regulation.
The notification added that complete records of stock, sales and movement would be maintained and produced on demand by registered manufacturers, traders and sellers to any authorised officer of the DC.
All registered kite-flying associations, while complying with the responsibilities assigned under the regulation, were told to remain in close coordination with the DC and the authorised officers for the smooth and safe conduct of the kite flying event, it said.
Permissions granted under the notification were to be regulated and implemented strictly in accordance with the ordinance and its rules.
All motorcycles operating within the Lahore district were directed to comply with the safety specifications as specified in the kite flying regulation.
It directed all departments, attached departments, agencies and organisations of the government to assist the district administration and police to enforce strict compliance with all terms and conditions of the notification as per law, rules and regulations to ensure public safety.
The DC’s notification also called for all motorcycle riders within Lahore district to install safety wires in order to protect their lives.
“Any violation of this notification shall render the offender liable to action under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025 and the Punjab Kite Flying Regulations, 2025 including cancellation of permission or registration, seizure of material and prosecution in accordance with the law,” the notification added.
Kite flying is being allowed in Punjab after an 18-year hiatus — former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi had banned the festival in 2007, following an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists by prohibited sharp strings, as well as judicial pressure.
The Punjab government is now trying to revive the festival, on the recommendation of PML-N chief and former premier Nawaz Sharif following meetings with Basant stakeholders.
The Punjab government has issued strict instructions to the respective divisional commissioners, DCs and district police officers (DPOs) to notify the Basant dates after making arrangements for the festival to remain safe and ensure that no damage is reported to the lives and well-being of the people.
For Basant to be celebrated elsewhere in Punjab, the deputy commissioners of their respective districts will be required to issue similar notifications and ensure the implementation of the conditions and restrictions identified by the Punjab government under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025, a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite-flying.
Although the ban on kite flying continues in Punjab except on the three notified days, at least two incidents have been reported — one each in Lahore and Pattoki — in which a young man and a minor girl were injured by the string of a stray kite.
In this connection, a source in the Punjab Home Department told Dawn that the department was “disturbed” over these incidents because the manufacturing of string and kites, as well as kite-flying was banned across the province.
“How and where these strings (dor) and kites were manufactured?” the source said, adding that the department was of the view that the respective districts’ administrations should look into the matter and make arrests as these activities were tantamount to violation of notified rules and regulations.</p><small>2025-12-29 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2916163665e2785.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963929/police-official-martyred-as-terrorists-open-fire-on-vehicle-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police official martyred as terrorists open fire on vehicle in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: A police official was martyred in a gun attack in the Wanda Jogi area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
The district police’s spokesperson, Qudratullah, confirming the attack, said that “the official was going to his place of duty in a private pickup when terrorists riding on motorcycles intercepted the vehicle and opened fire on him”.
The incident occurred within the limits of the Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station in Darra Pezu Town.
The police official was identified as Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Mumtaz Ali, and was posted as the muharir of City Police Station in Tank.
The assailants managed to flee, while the police have launched a search operation, Qudratullah added.
The body of the deceased was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for medico-legal formalities, he added.
Later, funeral prayers for the deceased were offered at the police lines in the District Headquarters Complex, Tajazai.
Recently, many areas of KP have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
On Saturday, district police said that a wanted terrorist commander was killed during an ongoing operation in the district. A day prior, armed locals and police forces killed six terrorists in the same area.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-12-29 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/291536166c5dfcd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963928/na-secretariat-writes-fourth-letter-to-opposition-chief-whip-seeking-details-of-cases-involving-omar-ayub' target='_blank'><strong>NA Secretariat writes fourth letter to opposition chief whip seeking details of cases involving Omar Ayub</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly Secretariat on Monday wrote a fourth letter to the opposition’s chief whip, Amir Dogar, seeking a written reply detailing court cases pending against former opposition leader Omar Ayub.
Since Omar Ayub’s disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant. Meanwhile, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had maintained that the matter of the nomination of the opposition leader in the house is “sub judice”.
According to the press release issued by the NA Secretariat spokesperson, earlier letters on the same matter were sent on November 19, December 5, and December 19, 2025. “However, no response has so far been received by the National Assembly Secretariat,” it said.







The statement said that the “provision of this information is essential to fulfil the constitutional requirements for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition”.
“The [National Assembly] Secretariat has been made a party in certain subjudice cases involving the former Leader of the Opposition, making it necessary to obtain the current status of the cases,” the statement said.
“In the letter, the Chief Whip of the Opposition has been requested to provide the requisite information regarding the current status of court cases pending against Omar Ayub, so that the process for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition may be completed.“
The statement by the NA Secretariat elaborated that the process for appointing a new opposition leader can only proceed “upon receipt of the required information”.
In August, the ECP had disqualified the then-opposition leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, following his conviction in cases related to the May 9 riots.
Later, incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had nominated Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of opposition leader in the National Assembly.
The PTI leadership had emphasised that the protracted delay in the appointment of the opposition leader may erode the parliament’s credibility and undermine the democratic framework.</p><small>2025-12-29 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29152927493dde6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963920/lhc-judge-hears-pti-backed-mpas-pleas-against-property-protection-law-says-matter-should-not-be-politicised' target='_blank'><strong>LHC judge hears PTI-backed MPAs’ pleas against property protection law, says matter ‘should not be politicised’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore High Court’s Justice Faisal Zaman Khan said on Monday that the matter of the new property protection law “should not be politicised”, as he took up a petition filed by two PTI-backed lawmakers challenging the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025.
The ordinance, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes, has become a point of contention with LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspending its operation on December 22 and the provinicial government voicing opposition to the court decision.
Today, Justice Faisal Zaman Khan took up a petition filed by two members of the Punjab Assembly against the ordinance. The petition was filed by MPAs Imtiaz Mahmood and Ijaz Shafi — who are both backed by the PTI, which is in the opposition in Punjab — on Saturday.
Their lawyer, Azhar Siddique, appeared before the court at the hearing where the judge asked him whether the petitioners had raised their concerns against the law in the Punjab Assembly.
The judge further remarked that despite “extensive trolling”, the court had taken up the matter.
He expressed regret that the petitioners had not raised the matter in the assembly and opted to file a petition in the court instead, observing that the issue “should not be politicised” as it involves the property rights of poor citizens.
Justice Khan asked the lawyer whether it was “necessary to politicise the matter”.
He further said that it would have been understandable had the petition been filed by an affected person and regretted that the petition was posted on Facebook before the hearing.
“Principally, you should withdraw your petition,” the judge said while addressing the lawyer.
Observing that there was no urgency to entertain the petition during the ongoing winter vacations, he instructed the court office to fix it before any appropriate bench after the vacations.
LHC suspends decisions taken by DRCs in property disputes
Separately, Justice Muhammad Raza Qureshi of the LHC suspended the decisions of deputy commissioner-led dispute resolution committees (DRC) in four other petitions filed by the aggrieved persons.
Zubaida Bibi from Changa Manga and others had approached the court against the property ownership protection law and decisions taken by DRCs.
Justice Qureshi observed that commissioners and deputy commissioners did not have the authority to “remove the possession of a property on their own”.
For their part, the petitioners pointed out that the disputes over ownership of the land were already pending before civil courts, and the status quo was also maintained by the courts.
They said the DRCs ordered the removal of possession on applications filed by the opposing parties despite the pendency of the matter before the courts.
Justice Qureshi suspended the DRCs’ decisions and ordered the office to fix the petitions before a yet-to-be-formed full bench for further hearing.
The diagreement
The recently passed legislation — Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 — mandates resolution of land disputes within 90 days. It was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31.
It empowers DCs to communicate directly with revenue officials and civil courts — a measure that is said to be aimed at preventing unnecessary stay orders that delay justice.
However, LHC CJ Neelum suspended the ordinance’s operation earlier this month, observing that “it appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
She also questioned the purpose of the law and asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The LHC CJ observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy. “If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she said.
A day after the LHC CJ’s directive, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz argued against the decision, saying in a statement that it was “not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), on the other hand, had backed the LHC CJ’s decision and cautioned the Punjab government against implementing what it describes as the “unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.</p><small>2025-12-29 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/291408049c5efb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963922/appeal-filed-against-ex-spymaster-faiz-hameeds-conviction-by-military-court-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Appeal filed against ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed’s conviction by military court: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former chief of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Faiz Hameed‘s lawyer confirmed to Dawn on Monday that an appeal had been filed against the ex-spymaster’s sentencing by a military court.
“Yes, we have appealed his sentencing,” Hameed’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, told Dawn but did not share any details about the appeal.
Hameed was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court on December 11 after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
He had a 40-day window following his conviction and sentencing to appeal against the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) decision, according to Section 133B of the Pakistan Army Act.
The appeal is first reviewed by a Court of Appeals, led by a major general or higher, as designated by the army chief. The chief then holds the authority to confirm, revise, or overturn the sentence.
Historically, the military’s appellate process has stretched over several years.
Hameed’s sentencing
Announcing Hameed’s conviction and sentencing on December 11, the military’s media wing had said in a statement that the process of FGCM was initiated against him on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months.
“After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said.
ISPR had further stated that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
Hameed was referred to in the statement as “Mr Faiz Hameed, formerly a lieutenant general”, creating the impression he may have been stripped of his rank, although ISPR did not explicitly confirm this.
A source familiar with internal procedures told Dawn at the time any such withdrawal “is done through an administrative order” as per established rules, but declined to confirm whether it had occurred in this case.
Background
Hameed, who retired in November 2022, is the first former ISI director general and only the second three-star general in Pakistan’s history to face a full military trial and be sentenced to a jail term.
The case against him originated from accusations by property developer Kanwar Moeez Khan, who alleged that in 2017 that Hameed — then a major general in ISI — and two officers orchestrated a raid at his home and offices, seized valuables and coerced him into paying Rs40 million and financing a private television channel. The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court advised the complainant to seek remedies through the defence ministry, leading to a formal military inquiry.
While the Army Act typically allows action against retired personnel within six months of retirement, the proceedings reportedly invoked Section 2(d), which extends military jurisdiction to certain offences committed by persons not subject to military law, though exceptions were also available under Sections 31 and 40, which permit court martial regardless of time elapsed for offences involving mutiny, insubordination or fraudulent acts related to property.
A Court of Inquiry convened in April 2024 found grounds to proceed, leading to Hameed’s arrest on August 12 of that year. He was subsequently served a detailed charge sheet covering four categories of alleged misconduct: post-retirement political engagement; violations of the Official Secrets Act; misuse of authority, including the 2017 raid; and causing wrongful loss through coercive actions against Moeez.
The investigation was later widened to include several retired officers, among them retired Brig Ghaffar, retired Brig Naeem Fakhar and retired Col Asim, although the verdict did not state what determination the FGCM made regarding them.</p><small>2025-12-29 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29124659450db9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963914/speaker-says-law-enforcement-agencies-to-probe-chaos-during-kp-cms-visit-to-punjab-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>Speaker says law enforcement agencies to probe chaos during KP CM’s visit to Punjab Assembly</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan on Monday announced that an inquiry conducted into the chaos that marred the arrival of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to the provinicial legislature’s building over the weekend would be sent to the law enforcement agencies.
During his three-day visit to Lahore over the weekend, the KP chief minister had given an address at the Punjab Assembly to opposition MPAs on Friday. However, the visit was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Addressing the incident at a press conference in Lahore today, Khan said that the report on the unrest was being sent to the law enforcement agencies, which would conduct an independent investigation into the incident.
He said that he had informed the KP chief minister that a special permit was required to enter the assembly premises, and that in the absence of any other documentation, “at least” an ID card number would be necessary verification for anyone wishing to enter.
“This is a Red Zone with an extensive security parameter,” he said. “You cannot ignore it under any circumstances.”
He added that Afridi had agreed and provided a list of those accompanying him from the National and KP assemblies, which had been facilitated. However, the protocols had not been followed, he regretted.
He also accused Afridi of bringing unidentified individuals into the Assembly premises.
“Unauthorised entry is not permissible … work progresses according to the rules. Every little thing … Every individual has to be permitted to be allowed to enter the [assembly] premises,” he stressed.
Criticising the opposition, the speaker said raising objections to pieces of legislation was their democratic right but resorting to siege, arson and chaos reflected their incompetence and intent to create instability in the country.
“If you lack tolerance, then shut down the business of democracy,” he remarked, adding that assembly sessions cost billions of rupees and disruptions wasted public funds.
He further said that PTI workers were not barred from visiting the Punjab Assembly but hooliganism and violence would not be tolerated.
During his press conference, the speaker regretted that political parties’ outreach had become increasingly “regional” and confined to a single province, adding that they should be encouraged to increase their national outreach.
“Political parties strengthen the federation,” he said. “If their outreach is national … then the federation becomes strong.”
The speaker said that he had constituted a “high-powered” inquiry committee to investigate the incident, which was tasked to investigate the CCTV footage of Afridi’s arrival.
The Speaker said that the footage depicted a breach of protocol at the gates, firstly because there was a greater-than-expected number of people accompanying the chief minister. Multiple members of the entourage were not on the assembly’s list and were also unable to display proof of identity as requested, violating the security standard operating procedures, he said.
According to Khan, the situation then escalated as security staff were “manhandled” after the unidentified individuals were stopped.
According to the committee’s findings, he said, the unauthorised persons were those convicted in the past, including some under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
“These people who are charged and convicted with having burned government buildings — instead of putting them in jail, you’ll bring them into the Punjab Assembly?” he said. “This cannot be allowed under any circumstances.”
Khan stressed that even the speaker of the assembly, who was thought of as all-important, was bound “by every word written in the procedure”.
He recalled that the PTI had violated even the sanctity of the most sacred places for Muslims in Saudi Arabia for their political agenda.
“Those who do not respect the sanctity of holy limits cannot respect democratic institutions,” he said, vowing action against all responsible individuals as per the investigation report.
Khan reiterated that violations had occurred not only inside the Punjab Assembly but beyond it as well, and urged all institutions to conduct thorough investigations to ensure accountability and uphold democratic norms.</p><small>2025-12-29 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29131706a0a4f0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963919/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-persecution-of-minorities-in-india-following-reports-of-vandalism-marring-christmas-festivities' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses concern over persecution of minorities in India following reports of vandalism marring Christmas festivities</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday that the persecution of minorities in India was a matter of “deep concern” following incidents of vandalism reported in the neighbouring country ahead of Christmas.
Last week, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “The persecution of minorities in India is a matter of deep concern.
“Recent condemnable incidents of vandalism during Christmas, as well as state-sponsored campaigns targeting Muslims — including the demolition of their homes and repeated lynchings, notably the case of Muhammad Akhlaq, in which the state worked to shield the perpetrators from accountability — have deepened fear and alienation among Muslims,” it said.







Akhlaq, a 50-year-old man was beaten to death in India in 2015, while his 22-year-old son was severely injured after it was rumoured that the family had been storing and consuming beef in India’s Uttar Pradesh.
Last month, The Hindu reported that the Uttar Pradesh government was seeking to withdraw the case against the accused. Last week, Times of India reported that the government’s plea had been dismissed.
In its statement, the FO said, “The list of such victims is sadly long. The international community should take note of these developments and take appropriate steps to help protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities in India.”
Last week, The Indian Express reported that a mob stormed a mall and destroyed Christmas installations in the city of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state.

The incident occurred on the same day the Sarva Hindu Samaj organisation called for a “bandh” — a general strike — to protest alleged religious conversions and recent clashes over the burial of a person from a converted family.
“Around 80-90 people barged in,” an employee of the mall told The Indian Express, adding that the mob threatened and shouted at the staff, and “indulged in violence”.
Separately, in the Nalbari district of Assam, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal vandalised a school and disrupted Christmas preparations. The group has been classified as a militant religious organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency.
An unidentified police official told The Hindu that activists targeted St. Mary’s School in Panigaon village.
“The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme,” the official said. “They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration.”</p><small>2025-12-29 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29123834d649077.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963911/ndma-tells-authorities-to-ensure-preparedness-ahead-of-expected-cold-wave' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA tells authorities to ensure preparedness ahead of expected cold wave</strong></a><br><p>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in a weather advisory issued on Monday, asked authorities to ensure all necessary preparations and response measures ahead of an expected cold wave in the country.
The NDMA said that a “westerly wave” is likely to approach the western parts of the country from December 29 (today), resulting in rain and snowfall in various areas from tonight till January 2.
It said that the system was expected to grip “most upper and central parts of the country on Dec 31 and persist in the upper regions till the morning of Jan 2“.
According to the NDMA, “snowfall may lead to road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch and Haveli from the night of Dec 30 till the morning of Jan 2.”
It also projected a likelihood of “landslides and avalanches in the hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the same period“.
The authority advised tourists to exercise caution and “avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable and high-altitude areas”. In central and southern Punjab as well as Sindh, fog conditions are expected during the wet spell, it said.
It added that, “in view of the anticipated conditions, the NDMA has advised all relevant provincial disaster management authorities, the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, the State Disaster Management Authority and the Islamabad Capital Territory administration to ensure all necessary preparedness and response measures“.
It said in its advisory said that relevant authorities “have been urged to remain vigilant, ensure timely dissemination of information, keep emergency response teams on alert, and take proactive measures to minimise potential risks to life, property and critical infrastructure“.
The statement added that the NDMA was “closely monitoring the situation”.
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its weather advisory, has warned of rain and thunderstorms with snowfall over the hills in most parts of the country in the coming week.
It said that daytime temperatures were expected to drop further, particularly after the system passes.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2911234379b8cf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963909/youtuber-rajab-butt-physically-assaulted-at-sessions-court-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber Rajab Butt physically assaulted at sessions court in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted at a sessions court in Karachi on Monday during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
Butt appeared before the sessions court (Central) upon the expiry of his interim bail, which was granted to him on December 20. The hearing, however, was marred by violence and chaos as Butt was attacked.
Butt‘s counsel, Mian Ali Ashfaq, alleged in a post on social media platform X that his client had been attacked by “some lawyers” at Karachi City Courts’ premises during the hearing of a case.







He said the attack was carried out in his presence, in which Butt was injured.
“[They] continued to beat him despite being repeatedly asked to stop,” Ashfaq said, terming “such conduct by the lawyers unprofessional”.
He added, “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country.”
Ashfaq further stated that if “lawyers will become a party [in cases] every other day and continue to attack private litigants on court premises,  their respect will suffer an immense and continuous decline“.
“This is an unfortunate aspect that has no place in any educated society,” he said.
A video shared after the incident showed Butt, in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him.
Another video showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “Karachi Bar Zindabad” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Riaz Solangi, who is the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
In the video, Solangi is seen saying Butt had made a video in which he had used inappropriate words for lawyers. Another person in the group, who also appeared to be a lawyer from his attire, can be seen saying that “what has happened today, we did that over his words for lawyers and misbehaviour against them […] Anyone who says anything against lawyers will end up in the same condition”.
Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and seen one of the videos.
Mubarak and Butt, who have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, had returned to Pakistan together on December 10 from London after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by their relatives.
The have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, and Butt’s interim bail in the case that was taken up by the sessions court today has now been extended till January 13.
The case
Solangi had lodged a complaint against Butt in January at the Hyderi Market police station, under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the first information report (FIR), the complainant said that in December 2024, he watched a viral video of the YouTuber in which he was allegedly performing prayer (namaz) while music was playing in the background.
It is pertinent to mention that the FIR was registered after a sessions court allowed the complainant’s application filed under Section 22-A, seeking directives for the Hyderi Market SHO to lodge a case against the YouTuber.
As the video went viral on social media, Butt posted subsequent videos on his official Facebook page in January in which he was seen sitting with scholars from different schools of thought.
In the three-part video, he had issued an apology, stating that if anyone’s feelings were hurt by his unintentional actions, he deeply regretted it.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2910315301750cf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963904/bondi-beach-attack-hero-says-wanted-to-protect-innocent-people' target='_blank'><strong>Bondi Beach attack hero says wanted to protect ‘innocent people’</strong></a><br><p>Bondi Beach shooting hero Ahmed al Ahmed recalled the moment he ran towards one of the attackers and wrestled the gun from him, saying in an interview published Monday with a US outlet he wanted to protect “innocent people”.
Father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Sydney’s Bondi Beach on December 14, killing 15 people and wounding dozens in what authorities have described as an anti-Semitic terrorist attack.
Despite the tragedy, tales of heroism emerged of those who tried to stop the two gunmen during their deadly rampage.
Among them was Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit seller, who went viral for ducking between parked cars as the shooting unfolded and then wresting a gun from one of the assailants.

 

“My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being’s life and not killing innocent people,” he told CBS News in an interview that airs on Monday.
“I know I saved lots, but I feel sorry for the lost.”
Ahmed was shot several times in the shoulder after tussling with one of the gunmen and underwent several rounds of surgery.
He recalled the moment he “jumped” on the gunman’s back, holding him with his right hand and said: “Drop your gun, stop doing what you’re doing”.
“I don’t want to see people killed in front of me, I don’t want to see blood, I don’t want to hear his gun, I don’t want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help,” Ahmed told the television network.
Ahmed was at the beach getting a cup of coffee when the shooting occurred.
The father of two emigrated to Australia from Syria in 2007; his uncle Mohammed, a farmer, had told AFP in Ahmed’s hometown of Al-Nayrab days after the shooting.
“His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” Mohammed said.
The Australian government has fast-tracked and granted a number of visas for Ahmed’s family, local media reported.
“Ahmed has shown the courage and values we want in Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement.
One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, remains in custody on charges including terrorism and 15 murders, as well as committing a “terrorist act” and planting a bomb with intent to harm. He has yet to enter a plea.</p><small>2025-12-29 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29101859e41f066.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963903/china-launches-war-games-around-taiwan-as-island-vows-to-defend-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>China launches war games around Taiwan as island vows to defend democracy</strong></a><br><p>China’s military moved army, naval, air force and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its “Justice Mission 2025” drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.
The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8am (5am PKT).
This marks China’s sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island, and follows a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing’s territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
The exercises began 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China’s defence ministry and warnings the military would “take forceful measures” in response.
China’s military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practice striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated attack on the island from multiple directions.
“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills.
A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation and undermine regional peace, and called on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.
Scare tactics
The island’s defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around the island over the last 24 hours, and that Taiwan’s military was on high alert and poised to carry out “rapid response exercises”.
That particular drill is designed to move troops swiftly in case China suddenly turns one of its drills around the island into an attack.
“All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the defence ministry said.
Dozens of Chinese military boats and planes were operating near Taiwan on Monday, and some of them “deliberately closing in” to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as being 24 nautical miles from its coast, a senior Taiwan security official told Reuters.
Taiwan’s coast guard said it had dispatched large ships in reaction to Chinese coast guard activity near the island’s waters and that it was working with the island’s military to minimise the drills’ impact on maritime routes and fishing areas.

 

Taiwan stock markets were unaffected by the drills, up 0.6 per cent to a record high in morning trading.
“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher based in the capital, Taipei.
“Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan’s current government and how they choose to respond.”
Taiwan rejects China’s claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island’s future.
‘Smash the separatist scoundrels’
The Chinese military released two posters titled “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions,” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”, along with a third graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.
China’s state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan’s vital deep-water Port of Keelung to the island’s north and Kaohsiung to Taiwan’s south, the island’s largest port city.
While the PLA practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at “deterrence” of outside military intervention.
The Japanese prime minister’s remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging stressing its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan’s “return to China” after World War Two was central to Beijing’s vision of the global order.
The first poster appeared to show the armada of civilian ships China is mobilising to help in an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults were also shown.
“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” the poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”
The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan and spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te a “parasite” and began using the cartoon green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.
“I think their (China’s) goal is, as they said, ‘keep the island, not the people,’” said Stephanie Huang, a 56-year-old interior designer. “They just want to save face by claiming Taiwan as part of their own country, but Taiwanese people don’t see it that way.

Most experts expect only a modest downward adjustment in the year ahead.
To avoid a revenue shortfall and keep the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme on track, analysts believe the government may again fall back on lucrative indirect measures, most notably a higher petroleum levy.
Those who trust the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) reform intent and believe the government is committed to improving fairness by targeting under-taxed sectors and identified tax evaders also acknowledge that even the best efforts will take time to bear fruit. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain flat in the best-case scenario, and could even decline if the FBR becomes complacent or the government fails to sustain its reform commitments or control expenditure.
In 2026, to contain public discontent over shrinking jobs and weak investment, the government may be compelled to strike a finer balance between growth needs and stabilisation demands. Beyond resistance from powerful interest groups, it will also test the government’s economic team’s ability to negotiate effectively with the IMF.
A recent media report indicates that the IMF, which is closely monitoring Pakistan’s economic trajectory, also expects tax collection to remain broadly stagnant in CY26.

There appears to be little room for tax-rate cuts next year, with minor adjustments expected at best

From 8.9 per cent the previous year, the tax-to-GDP ratio rose to 10.3pc in FY25 and could inch up about eight percentage points to 11.1pc in FY26 due to higher taxation measures in the current fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, if the next budget includes expected reductions in direct tax rates, revenue collection may weaken in the second half of 2026, stalling further improvement and keeping the tax ratio broadly unchanged in FY27.
FBR revenues increased to Rs11.7 trillion in FY25 from Rs9.3tr in FY24, and are projected to reach Rs13.98tr by the end of the current fiscal.

 

Musadaq Zulqarnain, a prominent businessman and member of several government advisory forums, expressed cautious optimism for over-taxed segments. “Both the corporate sector and the salaried class are under severe strain. Any real relief, however, must stay within IMF parameters. My view is that the FY27 budget may offer some easing for both groups. Fiscal space for such relief can only emerge from substantial improvements in revenue mobilisation. The most sustainable path is broadening and deepening the tax base through leveraging data, technology, and stronger enforcement to uncover under-reported incomes. If implemented well, this can enable tax rationalisation without undermining stability or the IMF programme.”
Dr Hafiz Pasha, eminent economist and former finance minister, sees little room for tax-rate cuts next year. “At best, I expect only minor adjustments, if any,” he said.
A source familiar with official discussions said most participants favour revising tax rates. “I support and expect a major reduction of taxes on salaried individuals and corporations. We have the fiscal space; what limits us is the IMF’s primary surplus requirement. Current taxes exceed their optimal level and are now producing diminishing returns. Businesses are shutting down or slipping into informality to survive. Bringing rates back to reasonable levels would curb evasion and help expand the tax.”
Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice Chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and former chief economist, sees no scope for real tax cuts in 2026. “Substantial tax relief is unlikely while Pakistan remains under the IMF programme and struggles to meet ambitious revenue targets. Without credible offsetting measures, broad-based rate reductions are fiscally untenable.”
He also expects modest, targeted tweaks, minor slab adjustments or limited rationalisation, as the IMF continues to prioritise revenue mobilisation, compliance, and a wider tax base over statutory rate cuts. Still, Dr Javaid believes that some relief for salaried taxpayers is economically warranted, given the heavy burden on documented incomes and the resulting erosion of purchasing power and domestic demand.
Covering any revenue gap, he added, would require stronger tax administration, fewer exemptions, better enforcement in retail, real estate, and agriculture-linked incomes, and tight expenditure control. Unfunded tax cuts could jeopardise the IMF programme, making sequencing and financing essential.
Former federal minister Dr Nadeem ul Haq lamented over the narrow focus of Pakistan’s economic discourse. “All we hear is ‘tax, tax, tax’, because there is no real economics in the media or government, and our universities are producing no economists,” he remarked.
Rehmatullah Khan Wazir, a former FBR member, noted strong public pressure for tax relief. “There is significant pushback from professionals and salaried workers after sharp tax hikes over the past two years, driven by the IMF’s recommendations. The government may reconsider, especially given the accelerating brain drain, as high taxation is understood to be one contributing factor.
“I expect the basic exemption to rise from Rs600,000 to Rs800,000, the third slab to fall from 11pc to 8pc, and the top rate from 35pc to 30pc. These adjustments would be reasonable and should not derail the IMF programme.”
Chairman FBR, Finance Minister Aurangzeb and members of his team were approached for comment, but no response was received before the deadline.

The trigger was nuclear testing and the sudden pullback of external financing. The foreign exchange (FX) market melted, confidence evaporated, and multiple exchange rates emerged. You may call that a black swan.
But Pakistan’s FX crises did not end there. If we look at the major episodes that followed in 2008, 2018, and 2022, a clear pattern appears. What actually triggered past crises was political instability and policy paralysis, oil price spikes and inflation surges, and geopolitical shocks, along with International Monetary Fund (IMF) breakdowns.
In each case, the initial trigger came from outside the FX market. The rupee was not the cause; it became the transmission channel. Once these shocks hit, they exposed vulnerabilities that already existed, such as the elevated inflation, wide current account deficits, weak reserve buffers, slow interest rate adjustments, and, of course, the absence of credible IMF anchors.

Under the current SBP regime, the rupee remains an important optic, but reserves now anchor policy credibility

However, exposure alone did not create a crisis. What followed determined the outcome.
Sentiment — how stress became crisis
The turning point came when sentiment shifted. As confidence weakened, flows slowed, and expectations changed abruptly. The rupee’s behaviour at that stage became sentiment-driven, not valuation-driven. At that point, policy responses mattered enormously. Instead of allowing early adjustment, the response in all three episodes followed a familiar path: defend the rupee, burn the reserves, delay decisive action.
This combination transformed manageable stress into a crisis, setting off speculative hoarding. By the time the adjustment occurred, it was forced, disorderly, and credibility-destroying. This is why Pakistan’s FX history is marked by steep devaluations, not smooth depreciation.
Reserves — the regime going into 2026
Under the current State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) regime, supported by the IMF, the focus of macro management has shifted. The rupee remains an important optic, but reserves now anchor policy credibility.
That implies three important changes. First, the exchange rate is allowed to move, in both directions, rather than being held at a specific level. Second, the SBP intervenes to smooth volatility, not to defend the rupee at the cost of reserves. And third, periods of FX strength are used to rebuild buffers, not to signal stability.

 

This regime materially lowers the probability of a repeat of past devaluation episodes. But it also caps upside. The objective is to view the rupee through the lens of reserve strength, which, if maintained, can resist speculative pressure.
In this framework, reserves absorb shocks, remittances provide durable support to the external account, and import compression manages excess demand. ‘Danda’, through short-term administrative measures, is used to curb hoarding and speculative pressure.
Volatility may still occur, but with adequate reserves, it becomes reversible rather than destabilising.
What comes next?
Rupee dynamics into 2026 will be driven less by valuation gaps and more by a small set of structural forces. Inflation and interest rate differentials will define the underlying drift; Political continuity will determine whether policy credibility holds; External financing capacity and fiscal discipline will shape balance-of-payments risk; and reserve accumulation behaviour will limit how far volatility can travel.
Meanwhile, the trade balance will be influenced by oil prices and regional export competitiveness, even as geopolitical developments and global recession risk impact flows and sentiment. So how will the rupee perform in 2026?
Bear case: the new playbook
This scenario reflects political disruption, fiscal slippage, or renewed stress with the IMF. Inflation pressures re-emerge, and reserve accumulation stalls.
The rupee weakens more sharply. However, unlike past episodes, the adjustment happens earlier. The central bank does not burn through reserves to defend the rupee. In the short term, the ‘danda’ is deployed through administrative and compliance measures, as seen in July when the rupee briefly depreciated toward Rs285 to a dollar. Over the medium term, import compression is used to weaken demand, as observed as recently as last month.
With a flexible exchange rate and a clear focus on preserving reserves, step devaluations become far less likely, even under stress.
Base case: inflation sets the long-run drift
Over any medium horizon, the rupee broadly follows the inflation differential. Pakistan’s inflation trend is still meaningfully higher than that of the US. Even assuming gradual disinflation, the gap remains around five per cent.
That implies a gradual depreciation over the year, consistent with inflation differentials, rather than a sharp or disorderly adjustment.
In this scenario, the rupee weakens steadily, without triggering stress in reserves or confidence. This is the scenario markets would be more comfortable with.
Bull case: stability with buffers
This scenario assumes relative political continuity, an intact IMF framework, and a stable geopolitical environment. Fiscal discipline holds, external financing remains available, and bond and multilateral inflows support faster reserve accumulation.
In this environment, the rupee may trade firmer for extended periods. However, the upside remains capped by reserve accumulation objectives and export competitiveness. Stability improves, but growth, unfortunately, sits on the back burner. Given recent trends, this is the most likely near-term scenario.

As dollar shortages in the open market persist, users seek dollars digitally, while the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) continues to deliberate on drafting detailed regulations. Inevitably, people are not waiting for regulations; they are already moving towards crypto rails facilitated by illegal operators entering the market.
There is, however, one group that awaits regulation: those wishing to operate legally. And this wait is causing them to patiently recalibrate, raising questions regarding the future of financial inclusion in Pakistan. An insider source at one such startup, Zar, highlighted that their focus has shifted towards their African markets as they await regulations in Pakistan before deciding “to invest much more money and energy into Pakistan.”
Aatiqa Lateef, a crypto expert, shared that this caution is entirely rational and that serious firms will scale where there is regulatory predictability, banking integration, and a clear supervisory roadmap. Highlighting the cautious optimism with the creation of PVARA, she added that “uncertainty tends to reward grey-market behaviour instead”, while noting that operational clarity is still evolving.

 

According to Ms Lateef, “The main gaps are around what NOCs [no objection certificates] actually permit today, banking access, and how stablecoins will be treated relative to other virtual assets.”
Zar’s recalibration comes despite validated market interest in one of the largest crypto markets — if the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users are correct — as previous reports indicated a $600m loss from crypto transactions in the first 10 months of 2025.
This number has now risen, according to Malik Bostan, Chairman of the Exchange Companies’ Association of Pakistan (ECAP), who highlighted that customers bought roughly $1.2 billion from exchanges to deposit in their foreign currency accounts over these 11 months. However, only $400m was deposited in the banks, as he alluded that $800m may have gone towards crypto rails, particularly stablecoins.

With its adoption accelerating outside the regulatory perimeter, the wait for regulation risks incentivising illegal operators

Ms Lateef sees this as an important signal: “FX liquidity appears to be leaking from formal channels into informal digital dollar rails. For an import-dependent economy, that kind of displacement increases pressure on the formal FX market.”
This comes after increased clarity on the licensing process, as Binance and HTX have recently been granted an NOC, a precursor to a complete “activity-specific” license, according to a LinkedIn post by lawyer Mariam Saleem. According to her post, after obtaining a preliminary NOC, Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) can incorporate their company with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, followed by the submission of a complete license application to PVARA.
Ms Saleem said, “Many VASPs are moving, but with restraint, because operators are still calibrating prescribed fees, timelines, documentation depth, and ongoing supervisory expectations.” She added that there is interest and direction, but “there is still uncertainty around execution detail and sequencing”.
These developments in 2025 have also been accompanied by interest from the banking sector, as Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said, there is interest across the industry regarding stablecoins and the use of crypto rails for remittances, and a number of exploratory conversations are taking place.
“However”, he said, “everything remains at an internal assessment and technical-evaluation stage”. Mr Rahman had previously told Dawn, “Banks will not move towards any form of activity until the SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework.” This can only happen once PVARA publishes its detailed guidelines.
While a source inside Zar said these regulations are supposed to come out in the next few weeks, this raises an important question about the transparency of this process, which, some argue, should be free of conflict given the recent promotion of a practitioner-led regulation model by the PVARA chairman.
Mr Rahman, on the other hand, offered that while the self-regulation model sounds appealing, in crypto, it creates a clear conflict of interest. “Many large crypto firms openly aim to bypass banks, so they can’t be the ones shaping rules in a system where banking stability, FX control, and anti-money laundering oversights are critical.
“Industry input is useful, but the actual guardrails must come from SBP and PVARA. Otherwise, the regulatory framework could end up favouring speed and scale over financial stability, which Pakistan cannot afford,” he ended.
Ms Lateef says that she is “supportive of practitioner input, but not practitioner-led regulation.” She further adds that Industry expertise is essential for designing workable rules, but the final standard has to come from the regulator.
Speaking on the ambitions of web3 companies in removing the middleman — in this case, disintermediating banks — Ms Lateef says that this narrative is ideological, not operational.
In mature markets, she explains, crypto firms inevitably integrate with banks because fiat on/off ramps require regulated institutions, compliance, settlement, custody, and reporting rely on banking infrastructure. Institutional liquidity comes from the banking sector, and consumer protections require a supervised environment.
While coexistence is the default in advanced jurisdictions, according to Ms Lateef, “What’s different in Pakistan is the structure of the financial system. Banks remain the primary gatekeepers for FX, payments, and settlement; remittances are a macro-critical lifeline, so regulators are rightfully cautious; and a volatile rupee and FX constraints make unregulated dollarised flows a systemic concern.”
According to experts, the next phase, which should be centred on co-design rather than self-regulation, must clearly address consumer protection, segregation of client assets, custody standards, disclosures, market integrity rules, grievance redress, and operational resilience. Credible oversight depends on making these requirements explicit and enforceable.

Investment patterns

Since 2020, Dawn has conducted an annual online survey to gauge people’s expectations for the year ahead. Following the sharp decline in personal and economic optimism during the pandemic years, people’s spirits have been steadily recovering. However, amid macroeconomic stabilisation and all that it entails, enthusiasm has dipped. While people still view their future as brighter than the economy, there is a downward trend both in personal and macroeconomic expectations.


Migration expectations

This growing unease is mirrored in migration trends, with 42 per cent of respondents indicating they expect to migrate in 2026, up from 36pc last year, an alarmingly high number that speaks volumes about brain drain. Not surprising given that the expectations that jobs will increase in the next year have fallen to an abysmal 19pc from 30pc last year.


Expectation that jobs will increase

Cost-of-living concerns also remain a primary driver of pessimism. Roughly, 54pc of respondents expect their expenses to rise in the coming year. This represents a notable shift in sentiment; after the hyper-inflationary years following the pandemic, many had hoped for a reprieve in 2025.


War expectation

With household budgets under pressure, 44pc of respondents report having no investments at all. For those who do manage to save, the Pakistan Stock Exchange and traditional savings accounts remain the preferred avenues for wealth preservation.
With 65pc of respondents not expecting war, public anxieties appear to be driven more by economic pressures than by geopolitical fears, even as regional tensions continue to loom in the background.


Forecast year

Taken together, the data suggest that while macroeconomic stability may have returned, economic confidence at the household level remains fragile, constrained by weak job prospects, persistent cost pressures, and a growing desire to seek opportunity elsewhere.
