<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/18164007422b00e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942949/psx-rises-by-1700-points-on-back-of-bolstered-investor-confidence-after-saudi-defence-pact' target='_blank'><strong>PSX rises by 1,700 points on back of bolstered investor confidence after Saudi defence pact</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) rose by 1,700 points on Thursday to settle near the all-time high of 158,000 on the back of increased investor confidence after the signing of a mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia.
The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1,775.65 points, or 1.14 per cent, to close at 157,953.46 — its highest level in history.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
Talking to Dawn.com, Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the pact had “bolstered investor confidence”, driving the KSE-100 Index to an all-time high close with the second-highest trading volumes in today’s session.
“This agreement is expected to pave the way for enhanced cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including greater export of skilled labour and increased prospects for investment across various sectors of Pakistan.”
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In Feb, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.</p><small>2025-09-18 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1816243777b2dbc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942946/us-embassy-in-india-says-it-revoked-denied-visas-over-fentanyl-links' target='_blank'><strong>US embassy in India says it revoked, denied visas over fentanyl links</strong></a><br><p>The United States Embassy in New Delhi has revoked and subsequently denied visas for some Indian business executives and corporate leaders based on their involvement in trafficking fentanyl precursors, it said in a statement on Thursday.
Fentanyl precursors refer to the basic or parent chemicals that form fentanyl, a leading cause of US overdose deaths.
The statement from the embassy did not name the people affected, but a spokesperson said they were Indian nationals.
Indian government officials have been closely cooperating with US counterparts to combat the challenge of drug trafficking, the US embassy added in its statement.
 






India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the US visa measures.
 
 

US President Donald Trump, whose punitive 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports hurt bilateral ties, has previously imposed additional levies on imports from China, Mexico and Canada, saying they facilitated the flow of fentanyl into the US.
In a statement to the US Congress this week, Trump listed India as one of 23 major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries, though he added the presence of any country on the list was not necessarily a reflection of its government’s counter-drug efforts.</p><small>2025-09-18 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/181122591599e43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942877/most-cordial-talks-with-saudi-crown-prince-covered-regional-challenges-bilateral-cooperation-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>‘Most cordial talks’ with Saudi crown prince covered regional challenges, bilateral cooperation: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>A day after Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a landmark mutual defence agreement during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Riyadh, the premier on Thursday expressed gratitude for the “heart-warming welcome” given to him in the Gulf State and shared that his talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman covered regional challenges, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz reached Riyadh for a day-long visit yesterday where he and Crown Prince Salman signed the ’Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ at the Al-Yamamah Palace in the Saudi capital.
“Deeply touched by the heart warming welcome, accorded to me by my dear brother HRH (His Royal Highness) Prince Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and prime minister of Saudi Arabia, on my official visit to Riyadh.
“From the unprecedented escort provided to my aircraft by the Royal Saudi air force jets to the smartly turned out guard of the Saudi armed forces, this welcome reception speaks volumes about the abiding love and mutual respect between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said in a post on X.
 






The premier shared that his “most cordial talks” with the crown prince covered a wide range of issues, reviewing regional challenges and enhancing bilateral cooperation“.
“I deeply admire HRH’s vision and leadership that he provides to the Muslim world,” he said, adding that on the bilateral front, he “greatly values” the Saudi crown prince’s “consistent support and his keen interest” in expanding Saudi investments, trade and business ties between Islamabad and Riyadh.
“It is my fervent prayer that Pakistan [and] Saudi Arabia’s friendship continues to flourish and attain new heights of glory. Inshallah! (God willing),” PM Shehbaz said.
PM Shehbaz left for London today after concluding his visit to Riyadh.
 






Defence agreement
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Wednesday’s agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades.
The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
Official Saudi media outlets also carried reports of the signing ceremony, but they offered no further details about the accord or its provisions.
Cooperation between the two states in the area of defence dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
Currently the number of Pakistani soldiers deployed in the kingdom is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 troops, providing operational, technical and training help to the Saudi military, according to a Reuters report. That includes assistance to the Saudi air and land forces, the report said.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded.
Today, Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkey and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represents Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.
Question of nuclear weapons
Asked whether Pakistan would now be obliged to provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella, a senior Saudi official told Reuters: “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”
The agreement was the culmination of years of discussions, the Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said when asked about the timing of the deal. “This is not a response to specific countries or specific events but an institutionalisation of long-standing and deep cooperation between our two countries,” the official added.
Pakistan has previously maintained that its nuclear weapons are only aimed, as a deterrent, against India, and its missiles are designed with a range to hit anywhere to its east in India.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X today that India was aware of the signing of the defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arab, and that it would study its implications for New Delhi’s security and for regional stability.
 






The senior Saudi official acknowledged the need to balance relations with Pakistan and India, also a nuclear power.
“Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can.”

The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said.
While not many details have been shared yet, the key driver of Wednesday’s agreement appears to be the principle that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.“
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage.
It is important to note that the agreement comes in the wake of Israel’s recent strike on Qatar, which has raised concerns for the overall security of the Middle East.
Former envoy Maleeha Lodhi termed the agreement a “significant development”, noting that it has “far-reaching implications” for both countries.
Speaking to Geo News, the former ambassador said, “Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have been engaged in a defence cooperation for a long time, and their diplomatic relations have always remained strong; however, with this agreement, the relationship has been shifted to a qualitatively different place.”
“At this point, it is clear that Pakistan has taken up  the role of a security provider, not just for Saudi Arabia but for the Middle East.”
Lodhi believed that “it is important to take into consideration the timing and the context of this agreement, since in the aftermath of Israeli aggression against Qatar, Arab countries have started to look elsewhere for security guarantees.”
“The United States’ role as a security guarantor has come under scrutiny as of late, and its credibility has been severely damaged,” Lodhi said.
“The agreement may have been in the works for some time, but it is important to look at the context.”
She added that, “currently, it is hard to say any more, and a full assessment can only be made when more details come to light.”
On the question of India’s place in the situation, she said: “It is clear that if Pakistan continues to strengthen its defence like this, its opponent cannot be happy about it, but we have to wait and see what sort of reaction will come from India.”
South Asia Analyst Michael Kugelman, in a post on X, said that, with the inking of the agreement, Pakistan now finds itself “in a very good place”.
Kugelman noted that, “This pact would not deter India from attacking Pakistan. But with 3-key powers — China, Turkey, and now KSA — fully on [Pakistan’s] side, [Pakistan] is in a very good place”.
 






Former Senator Mushahid Hussain, on the question of India’s place in the situation, said: “India is in a state of shock, they are taken by surprise.”
Mushahid, while speaking to Geo News, hailed the agreement as “the single most important military and diplomatic initiative in the past 50 years, after the Lahore Islamic summit.”
Noting the significance of the agreement, he pointed out that “this is the first defence deal between two muslim countries.” Mushahid added that “Saudi Arabia is not just any muslim country but one of the richest countries in the world, with a strong diplomatic influence.”
On the matter of Israel,  Hussain noted that the pact will serve as a deterrent for Israel; “With Pakistan’s military capability and Arab economic strength combined, Israel can’t do anything.”
According to the former senator, the recent four-day military conflict between India and Pakistan “showed our will, skill and capability that we can defend our Arab friends just as well,” positing Pakistan as a regional security guarantor. He also speculated that the agreement could have implications for terrorist elements within the country, particularly the TTP.
Former diplomat Hussain Haqani, in a post on X, noted the use of the term “strategic” in the agreement, saying, “‘Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement’ implies that it [covers] nuclear and missile defence. Pakistan has always used the term ‘strategic assets’ for its nuclear & missile programs.”
 






In a separate tweet, he said, “Most likely, Pakistan will now be able to buy US weapons it needs, with Saudi money, which [the] Trump administration seems willing to sell. Similar purchases occurred in the 1970s when the US Congress was unwilling to approve loans under Foreign Military Funding (FMF) for Pakistan.”
 






Analyst Uzair Younus noted that the agreement has cemented “Pakistan’s role as a net security provider in the Arabian peninsula.”
 






Journalist Iftikhar Firdous branded the pact “symbolically powerful and strategically consequential,” saying that Pakistan will now be seen as a “direct deterrent to Israel”.
“For Saudi Arabia, it’s a hedge against uncertainty and a signal of independence. Even though the pact does not officially include nuclear guarantees [at least from the available information], Pakistan’s arsenal casts a deterrence shadow.”
“This gives Saudi Arabia a de facto “nuclear umbrella” without formally breaching non-proliferation norms,” he said, cautioning that the move “increases the chance that local conflicts could spiral into regionalised wars with nuclear undertones.”
The agreement has brought Pakistan into the Arab world and its politics “like never before,” he said.

The Pakistan-UAE clash was set to go through on Wednesday after Zimbabwean referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts after much uncertainty surrounding the fixture in the fallout of the Pakistan-India match last Sunday.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha at the post-match ceremony said his team hasn’t batted at their best yet.
“We need to bat better in the middle overs… we’re till finding our way to 150+ scores,” Salman said.
Salman called player of the match, Shaheen Afridi a match-winner. The left-arm pacer was adjudicated POTM for his heroics with the bat and his contribution with the ball in what became a comprehensive victory for the Green Shirts.

Match analysis by Abyan Amir:

Shaheen reminded us of his father-in-law yet again with another terrific Afridi cameo that helped salvage the dithering Pakistani batting innings to reach 146-8 — and that was too much for the UAE batters from the get-go.
After all the drama in the lead-up to the match, Pakistan ended with a comprehensive victory in a match they were expected to win with ease and will now face India again with a chance at redemption in the aftermath of the controversy over the Men in Blue’s “disappointing” conduct in last Sunday’s encounter.
 






Fakhar Zaman reached his 50 off just 35 deliveries and got out trying to up the rate. The Mardan-born player was the Green Shirts’ sole batter who was dominating the UAE bowlers till Shaheen showed up.
The Pakistani batters made for another sorry showing as the home bowlers kept them in check throughout — barring Fakhar and Shaheen.
Left-arm spinner Simranjeet Singh was the pick of the bowlers for the UAE as he ended with figures of 3-26 and kept the home team in the match going into the second innings.

The bench, comprising Justices Muhammad Asif and Inaam Ameen Minhas, had taken up Rehman’s intra-court appeal against the earlier ruling, issued by Justice Babar Sattar on Tuesday, which had ordered the PTA chief’s removal over his “illegal” appointment to the position.
In his order, on a plea filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023, Justice Sattar had ruled that the creation of a post for Member (Administration) in the PTA, and the subsequent appointment of Rehman as PTA chairman, were “unconstitutional, illegal and void ab initio”.
His decision had been challenged by Rehman within hours of it being announced.
Today, Advocate Qasim Wadud appeared as the counsel for the PTA chairman, while Additional Attorney General (AAG) Salman Mansoor also presented his arguments.
At the outset of the hearing, Mansoor contended that “relief which was not even sought in the petition had been granted” in Justice Sattar’s order.
“Neither were the rules challenged nor was a notice issued to the attorney general. Issuing a notice to the attorney general was necessary,” he argued.
The AAG further argued that a request not sought in a petition could not be considered under Article 199 (jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
“The court itself stated that the entire argument was not complete yet,” Mansoor claimed.
Addressing the PTA chairman’s lawyer, Justice Asif remarked, “You were given enough opportunity.”
 
 

Wadud then came to the rostrum and said, “It was questioned in the writ petition that the appointment of PTA chairman could not be made [as] the vacancy was wrongly advertised.
“[But] the rules had been changed and the [federal] cabinet had given the approval, following which the appointment was made,” he contended.
“The rules had been amended on March 25, [2023], after which the petition was filed,” the counsel added.
Recruitment process ‘suffered fr­om malice in law’
The earlier judgement by Justice Sattar pointed out that the advertisement for the post, issued on March 28, 2023, had been published at a time when no such position legally existed. Later amendments to the PTA Appointment Rules in May 2023 were deemed insufficient to regularise the appointment process.
Justice Sattar observed that the recruitment process “suffered fr­om malice in law” and appeared to have been tailored to accommodate a specific individual. The prescription of a higher age limit of 61 years for the post, compared with 57 years for other members, was cit­ed as further proof of malafide intent.
The court had further held that the appointment of the retired army officer as PTA chairman without a transparent and objective selection process was “illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law”.
The judge had ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till such time as the federal government appointed a regular chairman.</p><small>2025-09-18 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/18143155490c222.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942893/imran-expresses-grievances-in-letter-to-cjp-afridi-urges-him-to-direct-ihc-to-fix-critical-petitions' target='_blank'><strong>Imran expresses grievances in letter to CJP Afridi, urges him to direct IHC to fix ‘critical’ petitions</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan has written a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, it emerged on Thursday as party leader Latif Khosa delivered it to the top judge at the Supreme Court.
In the letter dated September 16, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Imran expressed grievances over several matters, including the conditions he has been kept in inside jail,  and urged CJP Afridi to direct the Islamabad High Court to fix some “critical petitions” that had been “hanging in the doldrums” for hearing.
The petitions he was referring to pertain to Toshakhana and Al Qadir Trust cases.
Speaking to the media after delivering Imran’s letter, Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours.
He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms.
“The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had reached the court with the PTI founder’s letter, where she was reportedly barred from meeting the CJP by police. Khosa was later allowed access to the chief justice.
The letter
Imran began his letter with complaints about jail conditions, saying: “For over 772 days, from a cage measuring 9 x 11, from a dungeon of enforced silence, isolation and incommunicado, I have endured continued solitary confinement … All access to books and newspapers has been denied to me.”
“Meetings with my lawyers and family are “arbitrarily cancelled at the whims and wishes of one man”, Imran claimed, referring to the army chief.
He also alleged that his sons were barred from talking to him on phone and political workers were also not allowed to see him.
“It is not lawful imprisonment since its inception; it is only calculated psychological torture, crafted to break my will … It is an ongoing assault on the  Constitution, the rule of law and the democratic future of my beloved homeland, Pakistan,” he continued.
The PTI founder also complained of “inhuman and degrading treatment” being meted out to his wife, Bushra Bibi, in jail, alleging that she was being denied medical treatment and access to books and television.
He pointed out that superior courts have held that “female prisoners are entitled to leniency through bail as a matter of right”.
Yet, in Bushra Bibi’s case, “this principle has been suspended”, he said.
The former premier then went on highlight that “thousands of my supporters and party workers continue to languish in jails” and had been “abducted, beaten and subjected to military trials in flagrant violation of constitutional protections”.
He also expressed grievances with regards to the “political victimisation” of his family members.
“Courts that should stand as guardians of liberty have been weaponised to dismantle Pakistan’s largest political party,” the further said.
Imran maintained that his PTI secured a “landslide victory” in last year’s general elections “despite the brutal tactics, the suppression of all bold voices, despite my own imprisonment”.
“Yet, the mandate of the people was stolen overnight, turning democracy into [a] farce and the Constitution into a casualty. The same has been sanctioned and rubber-stamped by the leaked report of Commonwealth 2024,” he wrote.
Although the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group’s (COG) report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the group had “buried their report” after finding those polls to be riddled with problems.
Imran further said that “the so-called 26th Constitutional Amendment has been used as a tool to sanctify this electoral dacoity, while petitions challenging it lie unheard in your (CJP’s) court”.
CJP Afridi had ignored a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full apex court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between the chief justice and two senior SC judges.
Imran also wrote about the allegedly “questionable conduct of the Islamabad High Court under its chief justice, a byproduct of the 26th Amendment; Justice Sarfaraz Dogar, who deliberately refuses to fix my Al-Qadir trust petitions and the Toshakhana revision petitions”.
 
 

“He has fully abandoned impartiality and reduced Islamabad High Court to a facilitator of unjust and tyrannical campaign against me and those associated with me,” Imran alleged. “I remind him to fulfil his oath, instead of hiding behind frivolous ‘policy reasons’ to justify not hearing my petitions.”
He then urged the CJP to direct the IHC to fix the aforementioned petitions for hearing. He added, “I, as the patron-in-chief of Pakistan’s largest political party, seeks only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity and equality before law. I therefore request immediate hearings of the pending petitions before all courts. Allow all telephone calls to my sons as mandated by the jail manual, grant access to Bushra Bibi’s doctors for her medical treatment, and ultimately restore judicial independence of the judiciary in Pakistan.”
Imran concluded his letter, saying: “The courage of the verdicts you inscribe in the book of this nation’s destiny will go down in history … I urge Your Lordship to uphold the oath of your office and show the people that the Supreme Court of Pakistan remains their final refuge of justice.”</p><small>2025-09-18 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/181335216b23658.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942892/4-india-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-khuzdar-during-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 ‘India-sponsored’ terrorists killed in Balochistan’s Khuzdar during IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy” were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
“On September 17 2025, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan, on reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement said that during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, adding that “after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from slain terrorists, the ISPR said.
The terrorists were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area,” the statement read.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.
A day ago, the ISPR had issued another statement, saying that the armed forces had eliminated five “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Khuzdar earlier this week.
Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under attack in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured.
On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.</p><small>2025-09-18 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/18123531b756e08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942884/asia-cup-pakistan-gearing-up-for-india-rematch-says-captain-salman-agha' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Pakistan gearing up for India rematch, says captain Salman Agha</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan captain Salman Agha said his team were ready to face India in the next round of the Asia Cup on Sunday after last week’s group-stage match between the arch-rivals ended in acrimony when the Indian side refused to shake hands.
Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates in their final Group A game on Wednesday to advance to the Super Fours stage, where they will also play two teams from Group B in a round robin format.
Bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan has been suspended since 2013, and they play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
“We are ready, we are ready for any challenge,” Salman said after their 41-run victory against UAE.
“We just want to play good cricket. If we play good cricket, like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side.”
Fakhar Zaman made 50, but Pakistan’s frontline batters disappointed against the UAE’s modest attack, with opener Saim Ayub falling for his third successive duck in the tournament.
Salman acknowledged they had to bat better.
“We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order,” Salman said.
“That’s been a concern and something we need to work on.”
India had cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan last weekend in the first cricket match between the sides since a four-day military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
 
 

While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav dedicated their victory to the armed forces back home, which was seen as politicisation of the game.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match.
The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
India and Pakistan could meet for a third time at the tournament if they both reach the September 28 final.</p><small>2025-09-18 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/181132001c0bc06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942787/botox-under-burqas-cosmetic-surgery-in-vogue-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Botox under burqas: cosmetic surgery in vogue in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>KABUL: Decked out with fake crystal chandeliers and velvet sofas, cosmetic surgery clinics in Afghanistan’s capital are a world away from the austerity of Taliban rule, where Botox, lip filler, and hair transplants reign.
Despite the Taliban authorities’ strict theocratic rule and prevailing conservatism and poverty in Afghanistan, the 20 or so clinics in Kabul have flourished since the end of decades of war in the country.
Foreign doctors, especially from Turkiye, travel to Kabul to train Afghans, who equally undertake int­er­nships in Istanbul, while equipment is imported from Asia or Europe.
In the waiting rooms, the clientele is often well-off and includes men with thinning hair. But the majority are women, sometimes heavily made up and always covered from head to toe, more rarely in an all-enveloping burqa.
At 25, Silsila Hamidi decided to get a second facelift, convinced her skin had suffered from the stress of being a woman in Afghanistan.
“Even if others can’t see us, we see ourselves: looking beautiful in the mirror gives us energy,” said Hamidi, before she went under the knife to lift the upper part of her face, which “was starting to sag”.
Skirting details, the medical school graduate said her skin suffers from the “many pressures” faced by Afghan women.
Under Taliban government restrictions, women’s access to work has been severely constrained. They can no longer travel long distances without a male guardian, must not raise their voices outside the home and are banned from universities, parks and gyms.
Salons banned, but not Botox
While surgical cosmetic interventions may be booming, hair salons and beauty parlours catering to women have been banned.
“If they were open… our skin wouldn’t be in this state, we wouldn’t need surgery,” said Hamidi, who, at 23, had work done on the lower part of her face.
The Taliban authorities, who ordinarily forbid altering physical characteristics, did not reply for multiple requests for comment on cosmetic surgery.
Those in the sector said it is allowed as it is considered medicine.
The government does not interfere with their work, clinic workers said, but morality police check that gender segregation is respected: a male nurse for a male patient, a female nurse for a female patient.
Some claim that even Taliban members are clients.
“Here, having no hair or beard is considered a sign of weakness,” said Sajed Zadran, deputy director of the Negin Asia clinic, which boasts state-of-the-art Chinese-made equipment.
Since the Taliban ordered men to grow their beards at least the length of a fist, transplants have become fashionable, said Bilal Khan, co-director of the EuroAsia clinic, which is about to open a second facility.
And because not all clients are wealthy, some “borrow money to have hair before their wedding”, Khan added.
In the four-storey villa transformed into a clinic, the methods are the same as those used abroad and pose “no risk”, said Abdul Nassim Sadiqi, a dermatologist.
At his clinic, it costs $43-87 for Botox and $260-509 for hair implants.
Instagram effect
The sums are a fortune for many Afghans, nearly half of whom live in poverty, but a boon for those like Mohammed Shoaib Yarzada, an Afghan restaurateur based in London.
Put off by the thousands of pounds required in Britain for the same operation, he took advantage of his first visit to Afghanistan in 14 years to have his scalp replenished.
“When I enter the clinic, it’s as if I am abroad, in Europe,” he said.
To attract new customers, each clinic floods its social media pages with promises of beauty: smoothed skin, plump lips and abundant hair.
Afghanistan, like the West, is not exempt from the sway of social media influencers, said Lucky Khaan, 29, co-director of Negin Asia, which registers dozens of new patients every day.
“Many patients come without real problems, but want to have surgery because they have seen trends on Instagram,” said Khaan, a Russian doctor of Afghan origin, whose face is wrinkle-free.
While according to the UN, 10 million Afghans suffer from hunger and one in three lacks access to basic medical care, some “who lack money for food, prefer to invest in their beauty”, added the surgeon.

He was 89.
According to family members, Bhat had been unwell recently and “passed away peacefully at his residence”. Official sources said the administration suggested that the family “conclude the final rites by Wednesday night”.
Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and other colleagues from Srinagar were not allowed to visit Sopore, The Hindu said.
Bhat, who readily quoted from classical Persian poets to describe every crisis and its resolution, was among the few leaders in occupied Kashmir whose political career arc spanned from mainstream electoral politics to seeking a final settlement to the Kashmir problem.
Having quit his government job as a Persian professor to join politics, he co-founded the Muslim United Front (MUF), which contested the 1987 election. He later became chairman of the Hurriyat, an amalgam of at least  13 anti-India groups, in the 1990s, and steered Kashmiri politics for many years.
Favoured talks with Islamabad
A staunch advocate of talks on Kashmir with both Delhi and Islamabad, Bhat was among the few Kashmiri leaders who publicly met then-deputy prime minister and BJP leader L.K. Advani in 2004 and clicked pictures with him.
 
 

He earned both criticism and praise for his statements made after meeting Mr Advani. “The peace process should proceed step by step. Guns should be replaced by political talks,” Bhat said after the talks.
He kept engaging Pakistani and Indian interlocutors to push for structured talks on Kashmir.
Termed UN resolutions ‘inapplicable’
In 2017, Bhat was removed as the Muslim Conference president for meeting Delhi’s special representative Dineshwar Sharma and expressing his willingness to talk to New Delhi.
He had previously faced severe criticism from Hurriyat leaders in 2012 for saying that “United Nations resolutions on Kashmir were inapplicable and the time has come to chart out a common minimum programme with the mainstream parties”.
He was also among the few leaders who maintained a healthy relationship with mainstream leaders like Peo­p­les Democratic Party (PDP) founder Mufti Sayeed.
Bhat was a close associate and aide of Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.
“I lost an affectionate elder, a dear friend and colleague. A huge personal loss. Kashmir has lost one of its sincere and visionary leaders,” the Mirwaiz said.
 






Expressing her condolences, PDP president Mehb­ooba Mufti said: “I am deeply saddened. He was a voice of moderation amidst the tumultuous history of Kashmir, an esteemed scholar, teacher, and intellectual with a pragmatic approach to politics.
 






National Conference vice president and J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said he was “saddened to hear about the demise of senior Kashmiri political leader and academician Professor Abdul Ghani Bhat Sb”.
“Our political ideologies were poles apart, but I will always remember him as a very civil person. He had the courage to espouse the cause of dialogue when many believed violence was the only way forward and this resulted in him meeting the then PM Vajpayee ji and Deputy PM Advani ji. May Bhat sb find a place in Jannat,” Mr Abdullah said.

Hanif Noorzai

QUETTA: Kidnapped Assistant Commissioner of Tump tehsil Hanif Noorzai was released by his abductors on Wednesday night. Kech Deputy Commissioner Bashir Ahmed Breach confirmed the development.
Mr Noorzai had been abducted by armed men on June 4 while he was travelling from Tump to Quetta with his family to celebrate Eid.
His official vehicle was intercepted during the journey. The armed men allowed his family, driver and Levies guards to go, but took Mr Noorzai away at gunpoint.
 
 

The banned Balochistan Liberation Front had claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
According to sources, Mr Noorzai was released in Tump and later informed  the authorities about his release.
The assistant commissioner reached Quetta late at night on a special plane arranged by the Balochistan chief minister.

TEHRAN: Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iranian Minister for Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq exchange the notes after signing protocols at the Pak-Iran 22nd JEC meeting.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran have signed a series of crucial protocols aimed at dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers, expanding electricity exchanges, and strengthening communication channels to increase bilateral trade volume significantly.
The protocols were signed at the conclusion of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission (JEC) held in Tehran. Pakistan’s Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iran’s Minister for Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq led their respective delegations during the signing ceremony.
An official announcement of the commerce ministry released on Wednesday said that the signing of the protocols will help achieve a $10 billion trade target between the two countries.
 
 

In a separate engagement, Mr Jam Kamal held talks with Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad-Reza Aref to advance bilateral trade cooperation. The meeting centred on removing trade barriers, exploring export-import opportunities, and strengthening regulatory alignment between the two countries.

Agreements cover trade, energy, transport and labour mobility

Under the newly signed protocols, Pakistan and Iran reaffirmed their commitment to deepening trade and investment ties by eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers, activating cross-border markets, and encouraging regular Business-to-Business (B2B) engagements to strengthen commercial linkages.
In the energy and infrastructure sectors, both sides reached consensus on expanding electricity exchanges, including the revival of construction on a 220-kilovolt transmission line to Gwadar.
Discussions also included joint exploration of renewable energy initiatives. A dedicated Joint Working Group will facilitate investment in the power sector, while enhanced cooperation in water resource management and sustainable urban development was identified as a strategic priority.
In the domains of agriculture and environmental sustainability, both countries pledged to implement agreements on veterinary health standards, pest control measures, and joint development of agricultural seeds and equipment. Collaborative efforts will also target climate-related challenges, including mitigation of sand and dust storms and the conservation of mangrove ecosystems.
Transportation and connectivity emerged as strategic priorities, with accords to reinforce road, rail, air, and maritime links. Key initiatives include boosting rail cargo capacity, upgrading air navigation systems, and exploring passenger ferry services — particularly for Zaireen — between designated seaports.
Cultural and educational exchanges received renewed momentum through planned cultural festivals, joint media productions, academic collaborations, student mobility programs, and vocational training initiatives aimed at deepening people-to-people ties.
Agreements on joint training programmes, harmonisation of pharmaceutical registration protocols, and coordinated cross-border disease surveillance mechanisms marked progress in health sector collaboration.
Labour mobility received a boost through the establishment of a Joint Committee on Labour Cooperation, tasked with facilitating workforce movement in key sectors including construction, textiles, and agriculture. Both countries also reiterated their commitment to counter-narcotics efforts, agreeing to intensify intelligence-led operations and strengthen border coordination. Proposals to streamline visa procedures for businesspersons and commercial drivers were tabled, aimed at easing cross-border movement and enhancing trade facilitation.

In a keynote address at the Natural Resources and Energy Summit 2025 on Wednesday, Shamsuddin A. Shaikh, CEO of National Resources Ltd (NRL), highlighted the sector’s underutilised potential. He noted that while Pakistan sits on one of the world’s richest mineral belts, it contributes only 0.15pc to global mineral output and 2-3pc to national GDP. Of the 92 known minerals in the country, nearly 90pc remain unexplored.
Shaikh stressed the urgency of exploiting these resources, warning that failure to act quickly could result in foreign companies capitalising on the opportunity. “This is the time for Pakistani companies and investors to lead through joint ventures and partnerships, creating wealth and jobs at home,” he said.
Key projects already underway include Reko Diq, which has the potential to generate $4-5bn annually, Siah Diq ($1-2bn), Thar coal expansion ($200m), and barite, lead, and zinc projects ($100m). Together, these initiatives are expected to add billions of dollars to the economy within the next five years. Shaikh also pointed to further copper and gold exploration in the Chagai region, which could generate an additional $5-10bn annually after 2030.

Investment in Reko Diq and Thar coal could raise mining revenue to $6-8bn by 2030, says NRL chief

He emphasised that responsible mining could bring significant social benefits, including job creation, improved housing, and access to healthcare and education, particularly in impoverished regions. “Mining is not just about extracting minerals; it’s about building communities and eradicating poverty,” he said.
Hassan R. Muhammadi, Founder and Director of Fidelity Insurance Brokers, also spoke at the summit, highlighting the importance of mining and energy sectors in driving economic growth, enhancing energy security, and earning foreign exchange. He assured that the insurance sector is ready to support both local and foreign investors with tailored risk solutions.
Khurram Ali Khan, CEO of Fidelity Insurance Brokers, underscored the critical role of insurance in sustaining large-scale projects. “In volatile environments, insurance provides the safety net that keeps projects moving and investors confident,” he said.
Muhammad Sohail Tabba, Chairman of Lucky Cement, pointed out that mining could offer significant socio-economic benefits, particularly in rural provinces. He suggested that developing these resources, coupled with investments in education and capacity building, could bring prosperity, stability, and peace to underserved regions.
However, experts cautioned that without investment in governance, regulation, and human resource development, the sector’s potential could be undermined. Challenges such as inconsistent policies and climate-related risks need to be carefully managed, with innovation and technology playing a crucial role.
The summit, which brought together policymakers, investors, CEOs, insurers, and international experts, focused on how mining and energy sectors could become central pillars of Pakistan’s economic future. Discussions also centred on the role of specialised insurance and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in supporting these industries.
Shaikh urged both government and industry to act decisively. “This is Pakistan’s moment,” he concluded. “With the right policies and local investments, mining can become a $10bn-plus industry, driving growth, stability, and national pride.”

LHC Justice Jawad Hassan took up the petition, filed by Mahnoor Omer, which seeks to exempt sanitary pads and related products from sales tax.
With the court’s approval, the petition also added the Revenue Division via its Secretary as a respondent, arguing that the tax system indirectly discriminates against women and violates constitutional rights to equality and dignity as outlined in Articles 3, 9, 14, 25 and 37.
Advocate Ahsan Jehangir Khan, the petitioner’s counsel, said that only 12pc of menstruating women in Pakistan can afford commercial sanitary pads, forcing the rest to use unsafe alternatives.

Petition argues levy on sanitary napkins violates gender equality rights

 
 

He noted that locally manufactured sanitary products have an 18pc sales tax, while imports face a 25pc customs duty on top of sales tax. Even a key raw material, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) pa­­per, is subjected to a 25pc tax, he added.
“By taxing sanitary products, the state is penalising women for a natural biological function,” the counsel argued.
The bench, whoever, questioned the maintainability of the petition in light of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and raised jurisdictional concerns since the respondents, including the Revenue Division, are based in Islamabad. The petitioner’s counsel sought time to address these points.
Barrister Zain Mansoor, Assistant Attorney General, and Barrister Raja Hashim Javed, Assistant Advocate General, appeared on behalf of the federal and provincial governments.
 
 

The court issued notices to the federal government and other respondents to submit their replies within two weeks.
A separate notice, under Order XXVII-A of the Civil Procedure Code, was issued to the Attorney General for Pakistan to respond on the constitutional questions involved.
The matter was adjourned, subject to the petitioner addressing the court’s question of maintainability.

According to the military’s media wing, the terrorists were killed in the district on the night of September 14-15. The ope­r­a­tion was conducted aft­er the “reported presence of terrorists” belonging to the separatist Baloch outfits, it added.
ISPR said the forces eff­e­c­tively engaged the ter­­­r­­o­­rists’ location, five terrorists were killed after aft­er an intense exchange of fire.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained act­ively involved in num­erous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR said, adding that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any oth­er terrorists found in the area.
Four killed in Kech
Four alleged militants were also killed in the Kech district.
The Counter-Terrorism Department of the Balochistan police claimed two suspects were killed in Dasht, Turbat, at a crossing of the M-8 motorway.
They were allegedly spotted in the CCTV footage planting an explosive device. The CTD personnel immediately acted and killed the suspects.
Policeman slain
In the Sherani district, an official of the Balochistan Police Constabulary was martyred and two Levies men were injured in the attack on the police and Levies stations on Tuesday night in Mir Ali Khel area of the district. The assailants used heavy weapons, including rockets, to target the personnel from nearby mountains.
 
 

The law enforcement officials immediately took positions and returned fire. “A heavy gun battle continued for over two hours in the area,” Deputy Commissioner Hazrat Wali Kakar told Dawn. He said the attack was repulsed and the militants’ effort to enter the police lines was foiled.
In the exchange of fire, Balochistan Police Constabulary’s Aftabur Rehman, a resident of Muslim Bagh, was martyred, while two Levies personnel were injured in the attack. “One Levies man is missing,” DC Kakar said, adding that the search operation in the area was ongoing.
The assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire, and buildings also sustained damage.
Landmine blasts
In another incident, three civilians were killed and a girl was injured in two landmine explosions in the Dera Bugti district.
Officials said that both incidents occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area of the Sui tehsil. In the first explosion, a woman was killed, while in the second blast, two men were killed.
No one had claimed responsibility by the time this report went to press.

The commitment was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday. The plan, aligned with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seeks to enhance maritime cooperation with China while promoting economic connectivity with Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
The framework emphasises infrastructure development, including the expansion of Gwadar Port, completion of Free Zone Stage II, and acceleration of East Bay Expressway Phase II to improve inland accessibility. A key component is the integration of the airport with the port to support multi-modal transit and regional logistics.
The plan also supports the adoption of electronic data interchange systems and smart port technologies to integrate Gwadar with Chinese and international shipping networks. Development of port-related industries, cold storage facilities, and warehousing is part of the strategy to facilitate transshipment and regional trade.

Govt plans strategic leap with port and airport integration

Beyond logistics, the framework outlines initiatives for scientific cooperation, industrial development, and maritime tourism. Proposed projects include joint marine science research centres, CPEC-linked industrial parks for fisheries, shipbuilding and aquaculture, as well as tourism ventures along Balochistan’s coast.
Education and human resource development are positioned as cross-cutting priorities, with proposed academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port management, and fisheries.
The plan aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative’s “green energy and ocean” objectives, emphasising sustainable use of marine resources and environmental protection. The minister stated that the 2025-2029 action plan reflects Pakistan’s commitment to building a resilient maritime economy and strengthening strategic maritime ties with China under the CPEC framework.

LAHORE: Following instructions from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Punjab government has announced it will soon be launching a comprehensive damage assessment survey across the 28 flood-hit districts of the province.
The decision to launch the survey was taken in a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman at the Civil Secretariat on Wednesday.
The meeting reviewed the ongoing flood relief and rehabilitation efforts in the province and assessed the readiness of the local administrations for the effective distribution of aid, restoration of damaged infrastructure and deployment of health services in the affected areas.
The chief secretary directed the provision of additional tents and food supplies to the flood-stricken communities of Uch Sharif. He instructed the Bahawalpur deputy commissioner (DC) to remain in the field and personally oversee relief operations in the district.
Mr Zaman said a survey would be initiated soon to assess loss of human lives during the flood and the damage caused to houses, crops and livestock.
The DCs have been directed to personally supervise the survey process in the field to ensure transparency and accuracy.
 


The chief secretary also stressed swift drainage of stagnant floodwater, prevention of disease outbreaks, improvement in sanitation and restoration  of road connectivity in the affected areas.
“As water levels recede, water ponding must be cleared without any delay,” he said.
 
 

Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed brie­fed the meeting that more than 4,500 villages had been affected by recent floods. Over 2,000 teams are being mobilised for the assessment. Families displaced in Narowal, Sialkot, Chiniot, Jhang, Okara, Sahiwal and Sargodha districts have now begun returning home.
The meeting was attended by additional chief secretary, fina­nce secretary and other senior officials from relevant departments. Divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners from across the province participated in the meeting via video link.
Sutlej surging
Meanwhile, water levels in the Sutlej River continued to rise, inundating low-lying areas of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodh­ran.
Four days ago, the Noraja Bhutta dyke broke, submerging several union councils of Jalalpur Pirwala, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Bahadurpur, Dipal, Sundra, Kanu, Jhando, Beetowali and Kotla Chakar.
To save Jalalpur Pirwala city, the district administration carri­­ed out a controlled breach at Gil­­lani Road, diverting water tow­ards villages and kutcha areas.
Floodwaters damaged the Multan-Suk­kur Motorway (M-5) at five points and spread into villages along the highway in Mul­tan, Lo­­dhran and Bahawalpur districts, including Phagal Marhi, Hayat­pur, Jhanmp, Soiwala and Muradpur.
Floodwaters also reached Uch Sharif, submerging nearby settlements such as Jhangra and Basti Mir Chakar Rind. The Multan-Uch Sharif Motorway section has been closed to traffic after severe damage to more than five locations. National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) officials and police are enforcing diversions, with reopening contingent on receding water levels and repairs.
As water receded in Muzaf­fargarh’s Alipur tehsil, authorities recovered nine bodies from submerged areas, all of whom drowned during the flood.
Multan district administration spokesperson Waseem Yousuf told Dawn that while the Chenab’s levels were falling, a major flood surge in the Sutlej was expected to reach Jalalpur within days, threatening adjacent villages in Lodhran and Bahawalpur.
Relief Commissioner Javed said 118 people had died in various flood-related accidents. He said that 4.7 million people across 47,000 mouzas had been affected, with 2.6m people and 2m cattle evacuated. A total of 337 relief camps, 429 medical camps and 368 veterinary camps have been established.
He said that Mangla Dam is 95 per cent full and Tarbela is at full capacity, while India’s Bhakra Dam is 88pc full, Pong 94pc and Thein 88pc.
Punjab PDMA spokesperson said water levels were falling in nearly all major rivers of Punjab, including Jhelum, Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab.
“A low-level flood persists at Panjnad, with water level now at 148,450 cusecs, while Ganda Singh Wala continues to be in a medium flood with water level 95,000 cusecs,” he said.
He said that the water level at Sulemanki Headworks was rising at 88,238 cusecs while Islam Headworks was steady 71,751.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman said the government will soon begin a survey to assess the flood damage in the 28 flood-hit districts of the province. He was chairing a meeting to oversee rehabilitation efforts and directed relevant authorities to ensure the drainage of water in flood-affected areas and the restoration of roads.
The chief secretary also directed the immediate dispatch of additional tents and rations to flood-affected areas, particularly Uch Sharif in Bahawalpur, instructing authorities to remain present in the field to oversee relief arrangements.
Motorway damage
The NHA said on Wednesday that its teams were working round the clock to restore the damaged section of the M-5 Motorway near Jalalpur Pirwala.
 
 

In a statement, the authority said temporary restoration of one carriageway had been achieved while engineers and experts continued permanent repair work. Federal Secretary for Communi­cations Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA Chairman Shehryar Sultan have been on site to monitor the situation.
Several sections of the motorway were damaged after protective embankments cracked under flood pressure from the Chenab and Sutlej rivers. Traffic remains diverted to alternative highways until full restoration is complete.

• Putin, Modi hail friendly ties amid Trump pressure
BRUSSELS: The European Union’s top diplomat warned on Wednesday that  its push for closer ties with India could be hampered by New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil and involvement in military drills with Moscow.
The 27-nation bloc is pressing to seal a trade deal with the world’s most populous nation and strengthen bonds in areas like defence as US President Donald Trump has rocked the global order.
“Ultimately, our partnership is not only about trade, but also about defending the  rules-based international order,” EU foreign policy chief Kallas said,  as she unveiled a new strategy from Brussels to bolster relations.
“Participating  in military exercises, purchases of oil — all these are obstacles to  our cooperation when it comes to deepening the ties,” Kallas said.
But  she acknowledged the EU did not believe India would “completely  decouple” from Russia and the two sides sought to talk through their  issues.
Alongside other Moscow allies including Iran, India has taken part in Russia’s Zapad (West) joint drills with Belarus this  month, part of which took place close to Nato borders.
India became a major buyer of Russian oil — saving itself billions of dollars  and providing a much-needed export market for Moscow after it was cut  off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the Ukraine war.
US President Donald Trump last week pushed the EU to slap hefty tariffs on  India and China to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the  war.
But EU diplomats say that is unlikely while Brussels chases  a trade deal with New Delhi, although it could take steps against  Russian entities in India as in a previous sanctions package against Moscow.
Despite a lack of alignment over Russia, the European  Union and India are also working to conclude talks on a free trade  agreement by the end of 2025, amid New Delhi’s own tensions with Washington.
 
 

US-India ties have been strained since Trump raised  tariffs on most Indian exports to 50 per cent last month in retaliation  for New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner, with trade between the two economic  giants up 90pc over the past decade, Sefcovic said alongside Kallas in  Brussels.
Senior figures from India and the European Union hope to meet for a high-level summit early next year.
Putin-Modi friendship
Meanwhile, Putin and Modi on Wednesday hailed their friendship and warm relations,  holding a phone call despite pressure from Washington over growing  economic ties between the two.
Trump has bumped up tariffs on  India, which has become a major purchaser of Russian oil, with Western  sanctions imposed on Moscow over its offensive on Ukraine.
The Russian and Indian leaders spoke by phone a day after Modi held talks with Trump on the Ukraine conflict and the tariffs.
“Relations between India and Russia have been exceptionally trustful and  friendly,” the Russian president said in a televised government meeting  after the phone call.
Modi said on X he was “committed to  further strengthening our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership”  and that India was “ready to make all possible contributions towards a  peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict”.
 






Trump and Ukraine are trying to cut off Russia’s vital energy revenues, which they say  fund Moscow’s army and enable it to keep up with its offensive.

Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told a Council meeting on Afghanistan on Tuesday that entities like Al Qaeda, IS-Khorasan, TTP, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Baloch insurgent groups such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade continue to operate with impunity from across the border.
“We have credible evidence of collaboration among these groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists and coordinated attacks,” he said. More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added.
The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed.
 






Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities.
He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month, 12 Pakistani soldiers were martyred in a single incident,” he noted.
 
 

He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns.
He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion.
The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance.

• New route opened for Palestinians fleeing the embattled city
• EU proposes curbing Israel trade ties, sanctioning far-right ministers
GAZA CITY: Huge numbers of Palestinians were fleeing Gaza City by any means on Wednesday as the Israeli military pressed its ground offensive, killing dozens in strikes.
The Israeli army said it had struck more than 150 targets in Gaza City since launching a major ground offensive on the Gaza Strip’s main urban hub early on Tuesday.
AFP images showed a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, by car and on donkey carts, with their few belongings piled high as Israel bombarded the city.
Israel had announced the day before that the US-backed campaign in the Gaza Strip’s largest city had begun, pledging to destroy Hamas in the area.
The offensive has sparked outrage among the international community, with the Palestinian territory already devastated by nearly two years of war and the Gaza City region gripped by a UN-declared famine.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed at least 62 people across the territory on Wednesday.
 


The Israeli military said it was opening a temporary new route on Wednesday to allow people to flee, after unleashing a massive bombardment before dawn on Tuesday and pushing its troops deeper into Gaza City.
It came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing genocide in the Palestinian territory, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was opening “a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din Street”, as AFP images showed fresh bombardments.
Its Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT).
‘Death is cheaper’
The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings.
The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 350,000 had so far fled south.
But many Gazans say nowhere is safe and have vowed to stay in their homes.
“I won’t leave Gaza. There’s shelling here and there,” said Umm Ahmed Yunes, who is living in her partially destroyed home.
“Where would I find $1,000 or $2,000 for transport costs? Where would I buy a tent? There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.”
Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old.
“Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.”
In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency.
“Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness.
EU sanctions
The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption.
The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel.
“The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said.
 
 

“There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel.
The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric.
Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel.
“Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

• PTA policy draft ready, but chief’s legal troubles may delay promulgation
• Draft envisions all user data remaining ‘within Pakistan’; ISPs to block any content when asked
ISLAMABAD: With at least five companies interested in entering the Paki­stani market, the Pakistan Telecommu­nication Author­ity’s (PTA) spadework for launching satellite internet services in the country is almost complete.
However, a final requirement — registration of the service providers with the Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board (PSARB) — has yet to be fulfilled, holding up large amounts of potential foreign investment and stalling high-speed connectivity plans.
In addition, while the PTA’s draft policy for the registration of satellite-based internet providers is also ready to be rolled out, the legal troubles facing its chairman could delay its formal approval.
The policy draft was expected to be approved by the end of this month, but a court order declaring the appointment of the PTA chief illegal may delay its approval, since its notification requires sign-off from the chairman and two other members.
Meanwhile, PSARB sour­ces told Dawn that apart from Starlink and Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Techn­ology Limited (SSST), Eutels­at OneWeb, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and Canadian satellite company Telesat have expressed their willingness and completed their groundwork for launching services in Pakistan.
 
 

However, the key requirement of PSARB registration remains pending, as the board has yet to finalise its licencing regime.
A senior PSARB official told Dawn that consultations with stakeholders were underway, but the draft registration process for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers had yet to be finalised.
The process is expected to take more time, but officials could offer no clear timeframe for how long it might take.
Officials from the IT ministry explained that the main requirement was security clearance of the internet companies in question.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja had earlier claimed that satellite internet services would commence by Nov or Dec this year. However, she did not respond to a query regarding delays in the registration process.
A senior executive from one of the aspiring companies told Dawn that the registration process with PSARB was a first step, but establishing the administrative and network infrastructure to provide internet services to end-users would also take time.
Draft policy
The PTA’s draft policy for satellite internet providers envisions prompt compliance with official requests for content blocking, and a commitment to store all data locally.
Under the new “Fixed Satellite Service — Licence” policy, LEO internet service providers will be required to block websites, web content, or other services when directed by the PTA.
These providers are also prohibited from granting remote operational control, network infrastructure access, or monitoring facility access to any foreign entity, government, or person.
All LEO internet providers must install Fixed Gateway Earth Stations within Pakistan, through which all internet traffic will be routed. Similarly, all user data generated, stored, or processed by these services must remain within Pakistan.
While these stations appear to be the method for data control and content blocking, the PTA has faced complications in managing content censorship on social media platforms like X and YouTube in the past, so it remains to be seen how it will regulate satellite internet.
 
 

“The LEO companies provide internet directly to the customers at a fixed point through the satellites, like any Wi-Fi system — but this is fibreless,” a senior PTA official told Dawn.
The policy also permits LEO satellite internet providers to offer “Backhaul Services” to cellular mobile operators (CMOs). This means LEO companies can transmit data from cell towers and base stations to a central or core network for mobile operators, especially in remote areas.
“This will allow the telcos to provide data services in very remote areas also, to their customers, and the LEO companies will not sell mobile based data to the customers,” the official added.
Addressing a key concern regarding potential interference, the policy includes clauses to prevent LEO satellite beams from disturbing geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite beams and other wireless networks within Pakistan’s land, sea, and air jurisdiction.
 
 

GSO satellites orbit at an altitude of approximately 35,000 kilometres, whereas LEO satellites orbit below 2,000 km.
A “Satellite Interference Reporting and Resolution System” (SIRRS) is established within the policy for formal reporting and information exchange regarding international harmful interference affecting space services.
The Frequency Allocation Board (FAB), Pakistan’s designated notifying administration for satellite services at the International Tele­communication Union (ITU), will handle such complaints and reporting.
Beyond an initial license fee of $500,000 (or equivalent in Pakistan Rupees), companies will be required to contribute 1.5 per cent of their annual gross revenue to the Universal Service Fund (USF).

The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
A statement from the PM’s office announced the signing of the pact during a meeting at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace, which stated that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an act of aggression against both”.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement read.
 






The statement added that the agreement was signed on the basis of the “historic partnership extending for nearly eight decades … based on the bonds of brotherhood and Islamic solidarity, … shared strategic interests and close defence cooperation”, between Islamabad and Riyadh.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the two sides and their delegations reviewed the historic and strategic relations between both countries, along with a number of topics of common interest.
“[PM] Shehbaz Sharif … expressed his sincere gratitude and appreciation to [Saudi Crown] Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud … for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to him and his accompanying delegation,” the statement read.
“His Excellency [PM Shehbaz] also conveyed his best wishes for the continued well-being of … King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, [Saudi Crown] Prince Mohammed bin Salman … and the continued progress and prosperity, for the brotherly people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”
In turn, the Saudi crown prince extended warm wishes of good health and well-being to PM Shehbaz, the PM’s office said, adding that he wished for further progress and prosperity for the brotherly people of Pakistan.
Earlier, the pair met at the Yamama Palace for a meeting with the Saudi crown prince on multiple issues of bilateral interest.
The premier was welcomed by the Saudi crown prince and presented with a guard of honour.
 






PM Shehbaz was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz upon his arrival in the city, according to a post on X by PTV News.
Another post showed PM Shehbaz and the deputy governor having a meeting.
 






As soon as the premier’s plane entered Saudi airspace, “Saudi Air Force jets escorted and protected it”, state-run PTV News reported.
“This was a gesture of brotherly love and respect by the Government of Saudi Arabia. This honour in the Muslim world is the result of Allah’s blessings, Shehbaz Sharif’s diplomatic skills, and the unparalleled achievements of our Armed Forces.”
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said that PM Shehbaz undertook the visit at the invitation of the Saudi crown prince.
“During the visit, the prime minister will hold [a] bilateral meeting with the crown prince, to review the entire spectrum of Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations,” the statement added.
 






In its statement, the FO said that both leaders were expected to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest. “The visit is expected to result in the formalisation of cooperation in diverse fields, reflecting the shared commitment of both sides to further enhance and deepen their longstanding fraternal ties,” it added.
Highlighting the “historic relationship” between the countries, the statement said that the visit will “provide an important opportunity to the two leaders to consolidate this unique partnership, while exploring new avenues of collaboration, for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries”.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Environment Minister Musadik Malik and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
In July, President Asif Zardari met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmed Al-Malki to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade, economy and culture. During the meeting, President Zardari invited Saudi investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz had met the Saudi crown prince on a two-day official visit in June, where he thanked the Saudi leader for his role in ending the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.</p><small>2025-09-17 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17202919fa3968f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942602/andy-pycroft-apologises-icc-expresses-willingness-for-probe-of-handshake-controversy-pcb' target='_blank'><strong>Andy Pycroft apologises, ICC expresses willingness for probe of handshake controversy: PCB</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said that Zimbabwean referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
Uncertainty regarding the national team’s participation in the Asia Cup today emerged after the handshake controversy that unfolded in their match against archrivals India.
The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players. The PCB said that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for today’s game as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand.
A statement issued today by the PCB shortly before the toss between Pakistan and UAE said: “The ICC’s match referee, Andy Pycroft, has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistan cricket team.”
It said he termed the Sunday incident “a result of miscommunication and apologised”. The PCB also added that the ICC expressed its willingness to conduct an inquiry into the code of conduct violation that occurred during the match.
 






Addressing a press conference in Lahore shortly after the toss, with former PCB chiefs Najam Sethi and Ramiz Raja, cricket board chairman Mohsin Naqvi reiterated the events of the past few days and said Pycroft had apologised.
“Politics and cricket cannot go together. Let sports remain sports. Cricket should be above all this,” he said, adding that he had requested his predecessors for consultation since any boycott would have been a major decision with input from multiple stakeholders.
“These two specially came and we were constantly monitoring this because we did not even know ourselves what decision would be taken at the last moment. God maintained Pakistan’s dignity as the nation was expecting and I hope that we will now focus on cricket and not on politics.”
He said he had hope from the team of performing in the tournament and called on the people to support them till the end.
“We have a big panel of selectors, which will review and if there is any weakness, I promise that I will sit with them and tell them to remove them,” he said.
 






Sethi also said that politics should not be involved with sports, adding that the PCB had displayed sportsmanship. “I think cricket is the winner and we should continue to play the game,” he added.
Meanwhile, Raja termed the development a “win” since he said the situation had become a “critical” one.
“Emotions were running high and I am happy that an emotional decision was not taken that would have damaged cricket,” he said, adding that the cricket team had to do any “talking” and channel any frustration with its performance on the field.
The Pakistan cricket team was earlier seen leaving their hotel for their Asia Cup match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday after Naqvi asked them to depart.
 






The Asian Cricket Council confirmed in a statement that the match would go ahead at 8:30pm PKT.
 






In a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad, PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had said in a statement that the board had not made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup.
The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE. The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game.
 
 

Earlier, media reports said the Pakistan cricket team would not play their men’s Asia Cup 2025 match against the UAE.
Geo News reported that the team was given official instructions to return to their rooms, with the team bus parking outside the entrance to unload the players’ equipment.
Footage run by DawnNewsTV showed team staff loading kit bags into a bus outside the players’ hotel, adding that the bus was headed to the stadium.
This is not the first time teams have tried to change a match official in international cricket. India, in a  2001 test against South Africa, tried to have match referee Mike Denness removed, according to a report by Cricinfo.
The Indian and South African cricket boards agreed to remove Denness; however, the decision was not taken by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p><small>2025-09-17 16:58</small></div><hr>
