Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Mirza, — who is in Qatar for the second round of the Higher Military Cooperation Committee (HMCC) — called on the Deputy Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, where both sides “reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace and stability at the regional and global level,” a press release issued by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“The civil and military leadership of Qatar acknowledged Pakistan’s pivotal and responsible role in ensuring regional stability,” it added.
Also present at the meeting was the Chief of Staff Qatar Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Jassim Mohammad Ahmed Al-Mannal. The CJCSC was presented with a guard of honour at the Qatar Armed Forces Headquarters ahead of the meeting.
As per ISPR, CJCSC “highlighted historic brotherly ties between both nations”, discussing the “future dimensions of cooperation in defence and security domains between the two countries within the ambit of the Higher Military Cooperation Committee.”
The Qatari military leadership lauded the sacrifices the Pakistan armed forces have made in the country’s fight against terrorism, ISPR said.
Pakistan and Qatar share strong bilateral ties across multiple sectors. In 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Gulf country, where both nations agreed to deepen cooperation and explore new horizons to strengthen bilateral ties. In October last year, Qatar pledged to invest $3 billion in multiple sectors in Pakistan.
In October 2023, the then Chief of Staff of Qatar’s armed forces, Lieutenant General Salem Hamad Eqail Al-Nabet, had called on Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal General Asim Munir, and appreciated Pakistan Army’s continuous efforts for peace and stability in the region.</p><small>2025-09-04 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0417200317ff463.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939690/australia-excited-as-teen-sprinter-gout-makes-world-championships-debut' target='_blank'><strong>Australia excited as teen sprinter Gout makes world championships debut</strong></a><br><p>Teen sprinter Gout Gout will make a much-anticipated world championships debut in Tokyo this month as he marks an early milestone in a career Australia hopes will peak with Olympic gold at Brisbane 2032.
Still only 17, Gout is already one of the most exciting prospects in global athletics, earning comparisons with Jamaican great Usain Bolt and training with Adidas stable-mate Noah Lyles in Florida.
All this while juggling homework and exams in his final year of high school in Ipswich, Queensland.
Gout is skipping school for a few days to run in the 200 metres at Tokyo, only his second senior race abroad.
His first, in June, saw him win the 200m at the Ostrava Golden Spike event in the Czech Republic in 20.02 seconds, improving on his Australia record.

While impressive for his age that time only puts him equal-20th in the season rankings, meaning he may need to raise the bar considerably to earn a spot in the world final.
Just doing that much would send Australia into another frenzy of excitement.
Unheard of outside athletics circles a year ago, the son of Sudanese immigrants has become the pin-up boy of Australian track and field, boosting ticket sales at domestic events and bringing in a new, youthful audience.
Fans flocked to a Victorian gold rush town on the Easter weekend to see Gout race in the Stawell Gift, a local handicap footrace on a grass track.
Gout failed to make the final of the 120m sprint but the crowd of 6,000 was double the usual attendance and organisers were thrilled.
Gout’s 200m run at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne in the previous month drew 10,000 to Lakeside Stadium, the nation’s first sell-out crowd for a one-day athletics event in over 20 years.
Athletes and officials have warned Australia not to expect too much too soon in case the pressure becomes overwhelming for the teenager.
The warnings have largely flown out the window.
“What is also now a matter not open for debate is that Gout is the real thing,” said a typical testimonial in a Melbourne newspaper after national athletics championships.
“We are witnesses to greatness emerging in front of us by the race.” Gout can no longer go out in public without being swamped by well-wishers despite being largely sheltered from the media by his handlers.

Although signed to Adidas in a long-term deal worth a reported A$6 million ($3.90 million), Gout lives as normal a childhood as he can on the outskirts of Brisbane.
One of seven siblings, he shares a room with his brother in the family home in Spring Hill.
His coach, Di Sheppard, is no former champion athlete but a silver-haired 60-year-old who once worked in the uniform shop at Gout’s school. A renowned disciplinarian who scatters expletives throughout her interviews, she is convinced Gout will dominate the world in time.
“I’m not suggesting it. He’s going to go to that level,” she told Australian TV earlier this year.
“Olympic gold. It might not be ’28 (Los Angeles), but definitely going to happen in 2032.”
For the moment, Gout is still a work in progress, relatively sluggish out of the blocks but impressive in the back half of races.
It will take around 20 seconds in Tokyo to get a read on his place among the big dogs of track and field but possibly years of development before he can hope to leave them in his wake.

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties that span various sectors, including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure. PM Shehbaz is currently on a six-day visit to China, where he attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit held from August 31-September 1.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” said a statement today by the Press Information Department (PID) following the meeting in Beijing.
The prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC in Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway realignment and operationalisation of the Gwadar Port.
 






In a post on X, PM Shehbaz termed the meeting “warm and most productive”.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the premier said, noting the leaders’ agreement on advancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
PM Shehbaz said: “I thanked the Chinese leadership & the people for their steadfast support to Pakistan’s socio-economic development, particularly through the successful implementation of CPEC, which was now entering its next phase.
“Inspired by President Xi Jinping’s visionary leadership, we remain committed to building a stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future,” he added.
 






The PID statement noted the meeting was “warm and friendly”, with both leaders expressing their satisfaction at the positive trajectory of Pak-China relations.
PM Shehbaz expressed his “deepest gratitude to the Chinese leadership and nation for their unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development”.
Both leaders also attended the ceremony of sharing of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements signed related to the “development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, agriculture, etc”.
Recalling the “important consensus” reached between PM Shehbaz and President Xi Jinping in their Tuesday meeting, the statement noted that both premiers reaffirmed their “shared resolve to further strengthen the iron-clad, all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China”.
“The signing of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2029 was deemed as an important step in this regard.”
The prime minister asserted that the government’s “tireless reform efforts were yielding promising results, made possible through China’s strong support”. In June, China rolled over $3.4 billion in loans to Pakistan to help boost Islamabad’s foreign exchange reserves.
 
 

PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float Panda Bonds, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
The prime minister briefed the Chinese premier on the Pakistan-China Business-to-Business Investment Conference held earlier today, where “more than 300 Pakistani and 500 Chinese companies were in attendance”.
He stressed the vast potential for B2B cooperation and investment, identifying agriculture, mines and minerals, textile, industrial sector and IT as priority areas for mutually beneficial economic collaboration.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s support for President Xi’s landmark initiatives to strengthen multilateralism, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative.
The delegation-level talks were followed by a sumptuous luncheon, hosted by Premier Li in honour of PM Shehbaz and his team, PID added. Both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pak-China diplomatic ties next year, it noted.
The premier’s ongoing visit was expected to mark the formal launch of the second phase of the CPEC-II, which focuses on industrial cooperation.
 
 

PM Shehbaz later met Chinese Minister for Information Technology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
PM Shehbaz hailed CPEC as a central pillar of Pakistan’s socio-economic development and expressed satisfaction at its steady progress in its second phase.
Admiring the government’s economic reform agenda, Minister Li emphasised that China regarded Pakistan as an “ironclad brother and All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner”.
He expressed China’s firm resolve to elevate bilateral relations to “new heights of cooperation and collaboration”.
 






The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He emphasised that industrial cooperation was the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a “defining pillar” of CPEC’s development in its second phase.
He also invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “unique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
 






PM Shehbaz was also set to preside over the B2B conference, which was to “review the outcomes of the first edition, chaired by Shehbaz Sharif in Shenzhen in June 2024, and outline future plans”.
On Tuesday, at the sidelines of the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz and President Xi reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.
In his meeting with the prime minister, President Xi pledged support for Pakistan’s home-grown capacity for development, expressing readiness to build CPEC 2.0 and upgrade the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and step up cooperation in industries, agriculture, and mining sectors.
PM Shehbaz had stressed the “significance of the CPEC as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries to build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future”.
 
 

During his recent address at Tianjin University, PM Shehbaz reiterated that all endeavours and initiatives of the current government of Pakistan “closely align with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s vision and philosophy”.
The government has sent 1,000 agriculture graduates from Pakistan to China to learn modern techniques, while about 30,000 students from Pakistan have been getting education and training in China, the premier noted.</p><small>2025-09-04 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04144405d9a367e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939663/china-denies-conspiring-with-north-korea-russia-against-us' target='_blank'><strong>China denies conspiring with North Korea, Russia against US</strong></a><br><p>China defended on Thursday its decision to invite the leaders of Russia and North Korea to World War II commemorations, which President Donald Trump accused them of using to conspire against the United States.
Trump wrote a testy Truth Social post addressing his Chinese counterpart after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin flanked Xi Jinping at a massive parade in Beijing showcasing Chinese military hardware.
“Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump wrote.
 


Asked about Trump’s post, Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Thursday “foreign guests” had been invited to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II.
“It is to work together with peace-loving countries and peoples to remember history, cherish the memory of the martyrs, cherish peace, and create the future,” spokesman Guo Jiakun told reporters.
“China’s development of diplomatic relations with any country is never directed against any third party,” he said.
The Kremlin, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it thought Trump’s allegation was “not without irony”.
Beijing had much stronger words for the European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who also criticised the parade.
Kallas said on Wednesday that Xi, Putin and Kim appearing together was part of efforts to build an anti-Western “new world order” and was “a direct challenge to the international system built on rules”.
 
 

“The remarks made by a certain EU official are full of ideological bias, lack basic historical knowledge, and blatantly stir up confrontation and conflict,” Guo said on Thursday.
“Such statements are profoundly misguided and utterly irresponsible,” he said, adding, “We hope that those people will abandon their frog-in-the-well prejudice and arrogance … and do more things that are conducive to world peace and stability and China-Europe relations.“
Xi holds talks with Kim in Beijing
State media reported that Xi and Kim have had talks in Beijing while the North Korean leader is in China on a rare foreign visit.
China is North Korea’s most important ally, their relationship forged in the bloodshed of the Korean War in the 1950s.
Chinese state media said Kim and Xi met for talks in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People today. The foreign ministry said earlier that the talks would be “an in-depth exchange of views on China-DPRK relations and issues of common concern”, using the acronym for North Korea.

“China is willing to work with the DPRK to strengthen strategic communication… (and) deepen the exchange of experience in governance,” spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
Kim arrived in Beijing on Tuesday accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, his second reported trip abroad in six years and his first to China since 2019.</p><small>2025-09-04 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04162037539a34c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939681/searchers-retrieve-bodies-as-afghan-quake-toll-rises-to-over-2200' target='_blank'><strong>Searchers retrieve bodies as Afghan quake toll rises to over 2,200</strong></a><br><p>More than 2,200 people have been killed in the magnitude 6.0 earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan on the weekend, the latest toll from the authorities said, as volunteers and rescuers retrieved bodies from the rubble on Thursday.
The vast majority of the total 2,217 dead and nearly 4,000 injured were in the mountainous Kunar province near the border with Pakistan, deputy government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat wrote on X, adding that “rescue efforts are still ongoing”.
 






Firat said that the earlier toll of 1,469 dead and more than 3,700 injured would likely rise. “We cannot stop hoping” that injured people remain alive under the rubble, he told AFP.
Limited access to the hardest hit areas of mountainous Kunar province delayed rescue and relief efforts, with rockfalls from repeated aftershocks obstructing already precarious roads etched onto the side of cliffs.
While most of the areas that had been unreachable were accessed by Wednesday, expectations of finding survivors were fading fast.
“Many survivors are still believed to be trapped beneath collapsed homes in remote villages, and the window for finding them alive is rapidly closing,” the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a statement late on Wednesday.
‘Crisis within a crisis’
Poor infrastructure in the impoverished country, still fragile from four decades of war, has also stymied the emergency response.
The WHO warned that local healthcare services were “under immense strain”, with shortages of trauma supplies, medicines and staff. The agency has appealed for $4 million to deliver lifesaving health interventions, expand mobile health services and supply distribution.
“Every hour counts,” WHO emergency team lead in Afghanistan, Jamshed Tanoli, said in a statement. “Hospitals are struggling, families are grieving and survivors have lost everything.”
 
 

The loss of US foreign aid to the country in January this year has exacerbated the rapid depletion of emergency stockpiles and logistical resources.
NGOs and the UN have warned that the earthquake creates a crisis within a crisis, with cash-strapped Afghanistan already contending with overlapping humanitarian disasters.
UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said on X that the quake had “affected more than 500,000 people” in eastern Afghanistan.
 






After decades of conflict, the country is contending with endemic poverty, severe drought and the influx of millions of Afghans forced back to the country by Pakistan and Iran since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover.
Even as Afghanistan reeled from its latest disaster, Pakistan began a new push to expel Afghans, with more than 6,300 people crossing the Torkham border point in quake-hit Nangarhar province on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-09-04 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0413001579a41fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939647/indias-neeraj-chopra-needs-more-than-just-consistency-for-another-gold-at-the-world-championships' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Neeraj Chopra needs more than just consistency for another gold at the world championships</strong></a><br><p>Neeraj Chopra does not usually worry about distance as long as he gets on the podium but the poster boy of Indian athletics knows he may have to throw beyond the 90 metres mark if he is to defend his javelin world title in Tokyo this month.
A mop-haired Chopra became India’s first track-and-field athlete to win Olympic gold in the Japanese capital four years ago, and has since added a Diamond League trophy, world championships gold and a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Games.
In November last year, the 27-year-old brought in three-time Olympic champion Jan Zelezny as his coach in a bid to throw even farther. Six months into the partnership, Chopra registered a personal best of 90.23m in Doha earlier this year.
But the Indian has fallen well short of 90m in his last five outings and threw a modest 85.01m in the Diamond League Final in Zurich last week, finishing a distant second behind German Julian Weber’s monster throw of 91.51m.
While a string of high 80m throws have kept him in the top two in each of his last 26 competitions, Chopra acknowledged it would probably not be enough to leave Tokyo with another gold medal around his neck this month.
“This was not too bad. But we are getting very close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little bit further,” Chopra said after Zurich.
“There were a few things that went well, but still, there were the things which did not go that well.

“In this sport, we do not know. It depends on the day. In Tokyo, everything will be different.”

Weber laid down the gauntlet with a pair of 90m-plus throws in Zurich. Chopra and Brazil’s Luiz Mauricio da Silva are the other others to have breached that mark this season.
“Julian, he is a good friend of mine and I am always happy when he is doing well and we push each other,” said Chopra.
“At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal.”</p><small>2025-09-04 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04122539c08a527.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939641/global-funding-cuts-to-force-6m-more-children-out-of-school-in-2026-unicef' target='_blank'><strong>Global funding cuts to force 6m more children out of school in 2026: Unicef</strong></a><br><p>Amid global cuts in education funding, the UN agency for children (Unicef) has projected that an estimated six million additional children could be out of school worldwide by the end of 2026, with around one-third of them in humanitarian settings.
The projection was made in an new analysis, according to a Unicef press release issued on Wednesday, which said that the Official Development Assistance for education was estimated to fall by $3.2 billion — a 24 per cent drop from 2023 — with just three donor governments accounting for nearly 80 per cent of the cuts.
“Such a decline would push the number of out-of-school children worldwide from 272m to 278m — the equivalent of emptying every primary school in Germany and Italy combined,” it added.
The press release quoted Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell as saying, “Every dollar cut from education is not just a budgetary decision, it is a child’s future hanging in the balance.”
“Education, especially in emergency settings, often serves as a lifeline, connecting children to essential services like health, protection, and nutrition. It also provides the strongest opportunity for a child to escape poverty and build a better life,” she said.
The Unicef analysis showed that West and Central Africa face the “sharpest impact, with 1.9m children at risk of losing out”, while the Middle East and North Africa could face “an increase of 1.4m out-of-school children”, alongside major rollbacks in all other regions.
Moreover, 28 countries were projected to lose at least a quarter of the education assistance for pre-primary, primary, and secondary schooling. “Among them, Ivory Coast and Mali face some of the greatest risks, with enrolment at risk of declining by 4pc — equivalent to 340,000 and 180,000 students, respectively,” the press release said.
The analysis concluded that primary education would be hit the hardest, with funding set to fall by a third, “deepening the learning crisis and putting affected children at risk of losing an estimated $164bn in lifetime earnings”.
It further underlined that in humanitarian settings, “where education goes beyond learning, offering life-saving support, stability, and a sense of normalcy for traumatised children, funding could drop sharply – in some cases, cutting the equivalent of at least 10 per cent of the national education budget.
“For example, in Unicef’s Rohingya refugee response, 350,000 children risk losing access to basic education permanently. Without urgent funding, education centres may close, leaving children vulnerable to exploitation, child labour, and trafficking.
“Essential services such as school feeding programmes, sometimes a child’s only nutritious meal of the day, could see funding slashed by more than half, while support for girls’ education is also set to decline significantly,” the press release read.
Moreover, it was pointed out that “wide cuts at the system level will also undermine governments’ ability to make evidence-based plans, adequately support teacher development, and monitor learning outcomes.”
This means that even children who remain in school could see their learning suffer, with at least 290m students across all regions projected to face a decline in education quality, the press release said.
Unicef urged donor and partner countries to “act now to protect education by rebalancing education assistance to be more equitable and effective with a minimum of 50pc directed to least developed countries; safeguarding humanitarian education funding and prioritising education as a lifesaving intervention alongside other essential services; focusing education assistance on foundational learning, concentrating on early childhood and primary education where the returns are the highest; simplifying global financing architecture in line with the UN80 Initiative to improve efficiencies; and expanding innovative financing without replacing core funding to education”.
 






“Investing in children’s education is one of the best investments in the future — for everyone,” the press release quoted Russell as saying. “Countries do better when their children are educated and healthy, and it contributes to a more stable and prosperous world.”</p><small>2025-09-04 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04123611e6ae288.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939640/floods-in-gbs-diamer-district-damage-at-least-20-houses-crops-trees-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Floods in GB’s Diamer district damage at least 20 houses, crops, trees: authorities</strong></a><br><p>At least twenty houses were severely damaged, while crops were destroyed and trees were uprooted due to floods in Deral Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Diamer district, authorities said on Friday.
Since late July, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country, especially in its northern regions like GB, by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The assistant commissioner of Deral, Waseem Abbas, told Dawn.com that he flood occurred at 6am on Friday due to heavy rains, which engulfed the Gamari area.
“As a result of the floods, twenty houses were damaged, of which five were completely demolished,” he said. “In addition, crops and trees were also damaged.“
According to locals, many people fled when the flood hit, with dozens moving to safer places. They added that the water channel system was also severely affected by the flood, with damage to cattle sheds and livestock.
The National Disaster Management Authority has instructed citizens not to go near drains and stay in hotels during the rain.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that timely information was received from the villagers, which saved dozens of lives.
“On the instructions of the chief minister Haji Gulbar Khan, relief teams have been sent to Deral,” Faraq added. “The Deral administration has also been directed to visit the flood-affected areas and start relief and rehabilitation work on an emergency basis. Rescue and disaster management teams have also been sent.”
On Sunday, the Pakis­tan Meteo­rological Depar­tment issued a high-priority alert for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs) in the northern regions and warned of urban flooding in the country’s upper parts.
Last month, it was reported that hundreds of people in GB had fallen victim to water-borne diseases owing to a severe shortage of clean drinking water following devastating floods in the region.</p><small>2025-09-04 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0412451790096ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939646/analysis-chinas-xi-at-centre-of-world-stage-after-days-of-high-level-hobnobbing' target='_blank'><strong>Analysis: China’s Xi at centre of world stage after days of high-level hobnobbing</strong></a><br><p>Two blockbuster events in China this week were a successful exposition of President Xi Jinping’s vision of a new world order — one that puts him and his country firmly at its centre while sidelining his rival, the United States.
Since Saturday, Xi has met with almost 30 world leaders around the edges of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and a huge military parade marking 80 years since the end of World War Two.
The optics of Xi flanked by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as they watched a lengthy procession of long-range missiles, enormous lasers and underwater drones were difficult to misunderstand.
“Beijing is sending a message of defiance — that Beijing will not be afraid to stand by its friends … literally,” Australian National University (ANU)’s Wen-Ti Sung told AFP.
As well as Kim and Putin, largely international pariahs, Xi has hosted over the past days the leaders of Iran, India and Cuba, as well as multiple Southeast Asian, Central Asian and African countries.
Tianjin, then Beijing, became the world’s political talking shop as leaders like India’s Narendra Modi and Putin seized the opportunity to hold meetings together.
Declarations in support of Gaza and against European sanctions on Iran confirmed the SCO as a prominent platform for coordinating political positions at odds with Washington.
No major Western powers sent leaders to either the SCO or the parade, with Slovakia’s Robert Fico the only European Union member state head present.

“China is casting itself as the standard-bearer of a multipolar world led by the Global South, set against the Western narrative of a US-led liberal international order,” said Chatham House’s Yu Jie.
US President Donald Trump had a more direct take.
“Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” he wrote on social media during the parade.
 


‘China has options’
But many have seen Trump’s second-term actions — in particular, his erratic tariff policy — as a gift to China.
“It’s been Trumpian unilateralism rather than China’s wolf warrior diplomacy when people talk about the leading source of uncertainty in the international system,” said ANU’s Sung.
The enthusiastic SCO participation of countries that have traditionally leaned towards Washington — such as India, Turkey and Vietnam — underscores that shift.
In one widely shared clip from Tianjin, Modi, on his first visit to China since 2018, stood laughing chummily with Putin and Xi.
India is a close US ally and fierce rival of China — but relations with Beijing appear to be thawing while New Delhi has found itself the unexpected target of Trump’s tariffs.
 


Xi’s main practical gains from the last few days are this temporary reset of ties with India, as well as the strengthening of existing relationships with its Asian trading partners — all against the background of
Trump’s trade war, Chatham House’s Yu told AFP.
The events were “a diplomatic coup for Xi”, said Patricia M Kim from the Brookings Institution, showing China has “options apart from the West”.
“It doesn’t feel that it needs to go out of its way to accommodate US allies, especially when the United States is already alienating many of them.”
‘Smiling and snarling’
Notably, not all SCO attendees continued to the parade, including Modi. Kim only attended the military parade.
“Diplomacy requires an artful combination of smiling and snarling, and this parade, especially the visuals of Putin, Kim, and Xi together, will likely create reputational costs for Beijing,” American University’s Joseph Torigian told AFP.
China’s calculus might be that a “show of respect” to Kim will stymie North Korea’s growing cosiness with Russia, he said.
Yun Sun, from the US-based Stimson Centre, said the choice of guests of honour undermined China’s claim to have a “viable alternative international order”.
“It begs the question as to whether China really has no one better to showcase the diplomatic support [it] has in the world?” she said, adding Beijing had tried to persuade Western diplomats to attend.
The display of military prowess itself may well have made some attendees uneasy, in a region where China has multiple territorial disputes.
Ultimately, the parade is unlikely to change observers’ strategies.
“For those who have already decided to accommodate China, the parade might reinforce why,” said Mick Ryan, a retired Australian army major general now with CSIS, wrote on social media.
“For others who have decided to resist… it may provide additional purpose for doing so.“

The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. He was then sent on a five-day physical remand and later to jail for 14 days on August 28.
Today’s development comes a day after Shershah’s triathlete brother, Shahrez Khan, was also granted bail in a similar case. Shahrez was picked up on August 21 and was handed over to police custody for eight days before his judicial remand and bail.
In the last hearing on Tuesday, the ATC had again granted the prosecution time till today to present the case record in connection with Shershah’s post-arrest bail plea.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over the hearing today, where Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer appeared as Shershah’s counsel.
 
 

During the hearing, Umer pointed out that the prosecution had still not produced the case record in the Jinnah House attack case against Shershah.
“No one knows when the trial will begin. Therefore, the suspect cannot be kept in jail for an unlimited period,” the counsel contended. He asserted that “no evidence” had been produced against his client on the record.
“The suspect was not involved in any riots,” Umer stated, arguing that individuals with more serious charges against them had been given bail in other cases.
“Someone cannot be implicated [in a case] just based on one suspect’s identification of him,” the lawyer contended.
Pointing out the arrest “28 months” after the May 9 incidents, Umer alleged, “Vindictive actions are being taken because of being a part of the PTI founder’s family.
The lawyer called the purported recovery of a cane from Shershah, as per the prosecution, “planted”. He argued that the same ATC had previously discharged PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case based on a co-suspect’s statement.
Subsequently, Judge Gill accepted the post-arrest bail plea of Shershah against a surety bond of Rs100,000 and ordered his release, if not needed in any other case.
Umer, on X, said the bail was a “result of teamwork” of the lawyers.
 






Shershah’s lawyer, Barrister Taimur Malik, also confirmed the bail approval on X.
 






His cousin, Qasim Zaman Khan, referring to the bails of both brothers, alleged: “These arrests were nothing but political victimisation.”
 






Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-09-04 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041137147185a1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939625/pakistan-is-flooded-again-should-we-really-give-a-dam' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan is flooded again. Should we really give a dam?</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is flooded, again. A large part of Punjab is under water, while Sindh braces for torrents from the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab to converge at the Panjnad — where all of the country’s five rivers unite — and move south. All of this has created a never-before-seen situation: three of Pakistan’s five rivers are in super floods, all at the same time.
Entire communities have been displaced, and millions of acres of farmland that sustain much of our economy are now in ruins. Disaster management authorities continue to issue fresh warnings after urban flooding overwhelmed major cities — from up north to down south — during the monsoon season.
The headlines are grim, the warnings frequent, and the patterns familiar. The reflex is familiar too: build more storage. But a dam-first playbook cannot carry a 21st-century river system through climate volatility, geopolitical shocks and decades of misaligned land use. We need to change the way we decide, before we decide what to build.
Here, we are less interested in winning an argument for or against dams and more interested in asking better questions before building one. And, the record already urges us to do so.
A systems lens
The season’s death toll has climbed, and tens of thousands have been told to move to higher ground as flood waves roll down the eastern rivers. If this year feels like déjà vu, it is. The 2010 super floods affected around 20 million people. The 2022 deluge caused roughly $30-$40 billion in economic losses. These were not freak events; they were warnings from a changing river system.
The changing climate makes this warning harder to ignore. As the Hindu Kush–Himalaya warms, studies project substantial glacier loss this century, even under lower-warming scenarios. The shift will alter when the Indus delivers water and how reliably it does so, which is the pattern much of our infrastructure was built around.
Downstream, the delta is already straining from less freshwater and less silt. Research and field reports document chronic shortfalls in environmental flows below Kotri and the steady advance of seawater. None of this is theoretical. It is visible on the coast, on farms, and in the lives of people who depend on the river reaching the sea.
 
 

This year’s floods have also arrived in a tense transboundary moment. India has suspended participation in the Indus Waters Treaty process, which adds uncertainty to how and when water information and releases move across the border. In moments like this, the argument returns almost by muscle memory: build more dams.
The instinct is understandable, but it is incomplete. If the aim is genuine security in water, food, power and livelihoods, the question is no longer simply about how much storage. It is about the kind of storage and its operation in a river system that is fast-changing.
A systems approach starts from that reality. A dam is never just a dam. It sits inside a moving network of rivers and glaciers, power grids and crop calendars, cities and ecosystems, budgets and borders. Change one piece and the whole machine responds. A systems lens does not mean no dams. It means testing choices against the system we actually have, not the averages we wish we still had.
A volatile Indus system
Pakistan will keep needing storage. The question is what kind, where, and with what operating rules, given climate physics, silt, winter dryness, power demand, crop calendars and downstream ecosystems. The Indus system is already volatile. In a single season, our reservoirs faced opposite problems.
After a dry winter, Mangla hit dead level and Tarbela hovered near it earlier in March, which cut hydropower and squeezed irrigation releases. By mid-July, Tarbela’s spillways were opened to pass flood peaks. One season, we cannot store enough. Next, we cannot release fast enough. This swing should make us pause before assuming that more of the same automatically buys security.
 
 

Layer onto this the retreat of the Himalayan ice. Even if total annual water holds for a time, the meltwater memory that steadies the shoulder seasons fades. More of the year’s water can arrive in shorter bursts. Storage planned around historical timing can sit underfilled in dry winters and overwhelmed in short, intense monsoons.
None of this is an argument against dams. It is an argument for widening the lens. A project that looks elegant in a single hydrology scenario can stumble in the real Pakistan, where sediment rides the summer flood and eats live storage, where evaporation quietly taxes open water in hotter summers, and where operating rules must juggle three competing goals: monsoon flood cushion, reliable Rabi releases and summer megawatts.
In a systems view, the task is to build a balanced storage portfolio with operating rules that can flex as conditions change.
Reading the notes
So where does that leave us in the middle of another unrelenting monsoon?
With a change in the order of operations. Start by accepting that the Indus basin today is defined by timing and variability. Then judge any new dam by whether it adds flexibility rather than rigidity, whether its design and operating rules can adapt when winters run dry, summers arrive in pulses, and diplomacy turns noisy.
Be honest about the downstream coast that needs freshwater to hold the line against salt. Keep investing in complementary ways of holding water, including off-channel storage and managed aquifer recharge, so big reservoirs are not asked to do every job alone. If we do that, the debate shifts from concrete as a reflex to concrete as part of a system. That is a conversation that, hopefully, our decision-makers are having.
 
 

None of this is as exciting as a groundbreaking ceremony. It is, however, more honest about what the river is telling us. We cannot outbuild volatility with one instrument. We can make the Indus steadier by matching decisions to its dynamics and by admitting that infrastructure and policy are part of the same machine. A systems lens is, at heart, humility in planning. Test projects as parts of a whole. Price their fragilities alongside their benefits. Prefer flexibility in an age when timing, not just totals, is shifting.
Pakistan can still build great things. But the river has been leaving us notes — dead levels in March and spillways in July, encroached floodplains reclaimed by the rivers, glaciers shedding their memory of winter. Reading these notes is not anti-development. It is the way development stands.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04110130569c201.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939631/federal-jury-orders-google-to-pay-425m-for-tracking-users-after-privacy-settings-turned-off' target='_blank'><strong>Federal jury orders Google to pay $425m for tracking users after privacy settings turned off</strong></a><br><p>A federal jury determined on Wednesday that Alphabet’s Google must pay $425 million for invading users’ privacy by continuing to collect data for millions of users who had switched off a tracking feature in their Google accounts.
The verdict comes after a trial in the federal court in San Francisco over allegations that Google, over an eight-year period, accessed users’ mobile devices to collect, save, and use their data, violating privacy assurances under its Web and App Activity setting.
The users had been seeking more than $31 billion in damages.
The jury found Google liable on two of the three claims of privacy violations brought by the plaintiffs. The jury found that Google had not acted with malice, meaning it was not entitled to any punitive damages.
Google plans to appeal, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.
“This decision misunderstands how our products work,” Castaneda said. “Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalisation, we honor that choice.”
David Boies, a lawyer for the users, said in a statement they were “obviously very pleased with the verdict the jury returned.”
The class action lawsuit, filed in July 2020, claimed Google continued to collect users’ data even with the setting turned off through its relationship with apps such as Uber, Venmo and Meta’s Instagram that use certain Google analytics services.
At trial, Google said the collected data was “nonpersonal, pseudonymous, and stored in segregated, secured, and encrypted locations.” Google said the data was not associated with users’ Google accounts or any individual user’s identity.
US District Judge Richard Seeborg certified the case as a class action covering about 98m Google users and 174m devices.
Google has faced other privacy lawsuits, including one earlier this year where it paid nearly $1.4bn in a settlement with Texas over allegations the company violated the state’s privacy laws.
Google in April 2024 agreed to destroy billions of data records of users’ private browsing activities to settle a lawsuit that alleged it tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including in “Incognito” mode.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041107547dd206f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939628/stargazers-to-witness-rare-blood-moon-during-total-lunar-eclipse-across-asia-europe-and-africa-on-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Stargazers to witness rare ‘Blood Moon’ during total lunar eclipse across Asia, Europe, and Africa on Sunday</strong></a><br><p>Stargazers will have a chance to see a “Blood Moon” on Sunday night during a total lunar eclipse visible across Asia, as well as swathes of Europe and Africa.
When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
People in Asia, including India and China, will be best placed to see Sunday’s total eclipse, which will also be visible on the eastern edge of Africa as well as in western Australia.
The total lunar eclipse will last from 1730 GMT to 1852 GMT (10:30pm PKT to 11:52pm PKT).
Stargazers in Europe and Africa will get a brief chance to see a partial eclipse just as the Moon rises during the early evening, while the Americas will miss out.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
Blue wavelengths of light are shorter than red ones, so are more easily dispersed as they travel through Earth’s atmosphere, he told AFP.
“That’s what gives the moon its red, bloody colour.” While special glasses or pinhole projectors are needed to safely observe solar eclipses, all that is required to see a lunar eclipse is clear weather — and being in the right spot.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022.
Milligan, a self-described “solar eclipse chaser”, said he considered Sunday’s event a prelude to what he called the “big one” next year.
A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.
For more than a decade, Milligan has travelled the world to witness 12 totalities, which is when the Moon completely obscures the Sun.
Next year’s totality —  the first in mainland Europe since 2006 — will be visible only in Spain and Iceland, though other countries will be able to see a significant partial eclipse.
In Spain, the totality will be visible in a roughly 160-kilometre (100-mile) band between Madrid and Barcelona, but neither city will see the full phenomenon, Milligan said.
It will be the first total solar eclipse since one swept across North America in April 2024.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041006549e66ad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939600/theme-park-owner-arrested-for-raising-illegal-scheme-in-ravi' target='_blank'><strong>Theme Park owner arrested for raising illegal scheme in Ravi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the owner of Theme Park, an ‘illegal’ housing scheme raised in the river bed of Ravi.
The scheme was completely inundated by the swollen river last week.
“Khushi Muhammad built this illegal housing scheme in the Ravi land, made residential plots on 12,000 kanals inside the river bed and sold them to citizens by fraud. The suspect had not built the society as per law and even couldn’t establish any kind of sewage system in the fake housing scheme and since the entire area was inside the river, therefore, all the houses in the illegal housing scheme were submerged by the floodwater,” an ACE spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
He said the ACE had also sought record of all illegal housing schemes established in the Ravi bed from the River Urban Development Authority (Ruda) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) so that action could be taken against those housing schemes as per the law.

ACE seeks record from Ruda, LDA: promises strict action

“Theme Park was not approved by the relevant departments. Keeping in mind public complaints, the ACE has decided to take strict action against all such illegal housing schemes which are established on river land,” he said and added the construction of housing societies on river land could not be permitted at all and indiscriminate action would be taken against already-established illegal housing schemes as well.
 
 

A source said Khushi Muhammad was a police constable before he kicked off this project — Theme Park — with a small piece of land.
“By exploiting the loopholes in the system and greasing the palm of the officials concerned, he continued acquiring more land in the river bed and sold the same to the citizens. He also managed to transfer billions of rupees abroad.
Interestingly, it is the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) which usually initiates action against the housing societies involved in fraudulent activities but in this case the ACE stepped in first.
“It will be a test case for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz whether she successfully lays hands on those involved in this mega corruption housing scam along the river bed or buckles under the pressure of those who have strong connections in certain corridors,” an official source said and added not only the owners of such societies but top officials in bureaucracy that helped them build structures on the river land with impunity should be taken to task.
Federal Minister for Communication Aleem Khan, also the president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) which was dubbed as king’s party at the time of its inception in 2023, had got a major relief same year following NAB’s decision to close an inquiry against him for allegedly occupying and encroaching public passages and illegal extension of the Park View housing society both in Lahore and Islamabad under the new accountability laws.
The property tycoon was accused of illegally occupying ‘public passages’ and illegal extension of River Edge Housing Society Lahore and also illegal extension of a housing society (Park View) in Islamabad, thus minting money from general public by selling plots in unapproved phases.
The LDA had raised an objection saying the housing scheme was situated in a river area which could not be utilised for any residential purposes. “It is not safe for the people’s lives to allow residential construction there (Ravi area),” the LDA had informed NAB.
“The land also fell in an agricultural area and did not carry the characteristics of urban property thus the scheme was not approved. Despite this, Aleem Khan and others started selling the plots falling in the area for which approval was refused,” NAB had alleged. It is a big question mark how come RUDA, LDA or TMAs approved structures along the river bed.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises in Lahore. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by RUDA.

Officials said the M-10 project is a mega initiative that has evolved from a  simple bypass upgrade. It involves upgrading the Northern Bypass and constructing a new 134-kilometer six-lane  motorway through the Kirthar Range.
Additionally, a 23-kilometer stretch will be upgraded to a  six-lane road, transforming the entire route from Karachi Port to M-6 in  Jamshoro into a high-capacity motorway.
The project was discussed on Wednesday at a meeting between Communication Minister Aleem Khan and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at CM House.
 







Nespak is conducting a feasibility study on the proposed 134km M-10 project, Communications Minister Aleem Khan tells CM Murad

The meeting was informed that the M-10 project was currently in the feasibility study stage, being conducted by National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak).
Federal Minister Aleem Khan stated that the project’s core objective was to decongest Karachi by creating a direct high-speed link between the port and the national motorway network. The chief minister welcomed the federal government’s support as the federal minister assured him that the communications ministry and the NHA were committed to completing both M-6 and M-10 projects in a timely and transparent manner.
Earlier in May, the federal communication minister had said that construction of both the M-6 and M-10 motorways would now begin simultaneously, with the aim of connecting them directly to Karachi Port.
It may be noted that the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives had expressed serious concerns over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project and urged them to commence work without further delay by October, warning that the matter would be referred to the Upper House for intervention.
Welcoming the federal government’s support, the chief minister said that both projects were “vital not only for Sindh but for the entire country’s economy”.
Rs363bn for M-6
The chief minister said that M-6 would unlock opportunities for the youth of interior of Sindh through enhanced connectivity, while M-10 would “resolve Karachi’s traffic bottlenecks once and for all”.
A statement issued from CM House said that Federal Communications Secretary Ali Sher informed the meeting that the M-6 project had received final approval under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) with a budget of Rs363 billion.
He said that the project would be implemented in five phases by the National Highway Authority, with the Islamic Development Bank committing to fund two sections and a Chinese company expressing interest in undertaking all five sections.
The meeting was told that the M-6 project would complete Pakistan’s north-south motorway backbone, linking Peshawar to Karachi, and enhance trade, logistics, and regional development. The project is expected to reduce travel time, improve safety, and facilitate port-to-upcountry connectivity.
The meeting was attended among others by Provincial Ministers Sharjeel Inam Memon, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah and Ali Hassan Zardari, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Planning and Development Chairman Najam Shah and Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh.

World number one Sinner swept aside 10th seed Musetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in the first all-Italian men’s quarter-final in Grand Slam history.
“It was a great performance, very solid. I started the match very well,” said Sinner, who faces Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semi-finals on Friday.
 






Auger-Aliassime has won two of three previous meetings but Sinner thrashed him for the loss of just two games in Cincinnati last month.
“Every player who is in the semis of a Grand Slam can say they’re playing their best tennis,” added Sinner.
The 24-year-old Sinner also tied Nicola Pietrangeli for the most Grand Slams win by an Italian man with his 86th victory.
Auger-Aliassime overcame Alex de Minaur in a four-set battle lasting over four hours to reach his second US Open semi-final.
The 25-year-old Auger-Aliassime is back in the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2021 US Open after beating eighth seed De Minaur 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 7-5, 7-6 (7/4).
“Some days you won’t feel your best but I was willing to dig really deep and do everything I can,” said Auger-Aliassime.
“It feels amazing. Four years ago, it feels like more. It was a tough couple of years but it feels even better now to be in the semi-finals.”
Australia’s De Minaur, 26, has now lost all six of his Grand Slam quarter-finals.
“Right now I’m looking at this like a wasted opportunity,” De Minaur said.
Anisimova delivers payback
Anisimova rebounded from her disastrous double-bagel defeat at the hands of Swiatek at Wimbledon two months ago, beating the second-ranked Pole 6-4, 6-3 in New York.
“I’ve been having the run of my life here,” said Anisimova, the American eighth seed.
“The first day I got here I was like ‘OK, let’s try and get through one round… This has been such a dream. To come back from Wimbledon like that is really special to me.”
 






Six-time major winner Swiatek entered the US Open as the bookmakers’ favourite, after she followed up her maiden Wimbledon title with victory at the Cincinnati Open WTA 1000 event.
Swiatek broke in the first game of the match but Anisimova hit back immediately and snatched the opening set when her rival ballooned a forehand long.
Anisimova again had to rally after falling behind early in the second set.
She broke back for 2-2 and then moved a game from victory as Swiatek coughed up a costly double fault.
Swiatek saved two match points but a net cord in Anisimova’s favour sealed the win and a sense of redemption for the 24-year-old.
“Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I’ve had in my life,” said Anisimova.
Swiatek accepted she didn’t play well enough.
“I kind of have to let it go and just focus on the next one,” said Swiatek.
Osaka beat Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) to extend her deepest run at a Grand Slam since returning to tennis after the birth of her daughter in 2023.
The Japanese star hit 30 winners in a smooth performance reminiscent of the player who lifted the trophy here in 2018 and 2020.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in this position,” said Osaka, who has gone on to win the tournament every time she has reached the last four of a major.
“You play the best players in the world towards the end of a Slam. We’re all hoping to achieve the same thing. It’s kind of like boxing, but with a tennis ball,” said Osaka, the 23rd seed.
However, she has lost both previous matches with Anisimova — at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2022.</p><small>2025-09-04 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/040952370fb500b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939572/unexpected-rise-in-cotton-arrivals-despite-floods' target='_blank'><strong>Unexpected rise in cotton arrivals despite floods</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: In a surprising turn, cotton production in Pakistan has seen an unexpected increase this season, defying earlier predictions despite widespread heavy rainfall and flooding in key cotton-growing regions.
While the increase marks a positive development, the sector still faces significant challenges, with large areas of cotton crops submerged by floods, especially in Punjab. The floodwaters are now heading towards Sindh, threatening further damage.
According to the latest report from the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) released on Wednesday, as of Augu 31, ginneries across the country had received 1.336 million bales of raw cotton, reflecting a 9 per cent increase over the same period last year.
 
 

The rise has been largely driven by a notable surge in cotton arrivals from Sindh, where production is up by 87pc compared to Punjab. In fact, ginneries in Sindh received 352,000 bales between Aug 16 and 31, a sharp increase from 226,000 bales in the first half of August and a substantial jump from 130,000 bales in the same period last year.
This brings the total for Sindh to 1.336 million bales, a 13pc increase compared to 2024, despite the adverse weather conditions.

Lint production increases by 9pc driven mainly by a surge in Sindh

In contrast, cotton arrivals in Punjab have shown a more modest increase. Ginneries in the province received 466,000 bales by Aug 31, which is a 3pc rise compared to the same period last year. However, a separate report from the Crop Reporting Service Punjab indicated a record 125pc increase in cotton production in the province compared to the PCGA’s data.
Industry challenges persist
Despite the early positive figures, experts warn that the sector’s future remains uncertain. Ihsan Ul Haq, Chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, cautioned that the full impact of the floods and rains will only be clear once the adverse weather conditions subside. While many cotton zones have experienced only minor damage, Bahawalnagar, Pakistan’s largest cotton-producing district, has reportedly seen a 50% loss in its crop.
Moreover, a recent report by the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) projected a deficit of 100,000 tonnes (around 625,000 bales) in Pakistan’s total cotton production this year due to the weather-related disruptions.
Sajid Mahmood, an industry expert, explained that although initial reports show positive figures, they do not paint the full picture. Severe heatwaves, floods, and water shortages have put immense pressure on the cotton crop.

The additional revenue of about Rs174bn demanded by Wapda for FY26 also covers an unaddressed financial gap of Rs22.35bn for FY23, Rs56bn for FY24 and Rs61bn for FY25. The Rs365bn revenue requirement further includes Rs29.5bn net hydel profit (NHP) to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Rs1.55 per unit, Rs11.7bn to Punjab at Rs1.47 per unit, and Rs5bn in water use charges to Azad Kashmir at Rs1.10 per unit.
 
 

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has scheduled a public hearing on September 11 to assess whether Wapda’s claim is justified for an 85pc increase in return on investments and operations and maintenance (O&M) to Rs179bn in FY26, compared to Rs97bn determined in FY23.
This includes Wapda’s demand for raising O&M expenses from Rs24bn in FY23 to Rs30.665bn in FY24, Rs36.374bn in FY25 and Rs39.59bn in FY26 — a 67pc increase. The claims also include a depreciation charge of Rs7.924bn in FY24, Rs8.611bn in FY25 and Rs8.7bn in FY26. Nepra has also raised questions about Wapda’s demand for a weighted average cost of capital (WACC)-based return on power stations of Rs31.582bn, Rs32.294bn and Rs32.011bn for FY24, FY25 and FY26, respectively.
Similarly, the request for WACC-based return on investment in power projects amounting to Rs59.783bn, Rs78.408bn and Rs99.642bn for the same three years is under scrutiny.
Overall, Wapda has sought its own revenue requirement at Rs318.5bn for FY26 — an almost 166pc increase compared to Rs119.962bn in Fy23. In addition, Wapda has kept its estimates relatively stable for levies and dues payable to the provinces and AJK on account of NHP and water use charges.
Annual NHP payments to KP are estimated at Rs29.53bn for FY26 compared to Rs30bn in FY23. Similar payments to Punjab are booked at Rs11.969bn for FY26 against Rs11.867bn in FY23, while water use charges for AJK are projected at Rs5.085bn in FY26 against Rs4.222bn in FY23. Wapda’s power generation from all assets is projected at 31,563 gigawatt hours (GWh) in FY26, slightly up from 31,286GWh in Fy23.
A key issue for scrutiny will be Wapda’s request to carve out 20MW for a wheeling arrangement to Sky47 — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) of Mari Energy — for data centres of strategic and commercial use, in line with the competitive trading bilateral contract market (CTBCM), along with provisions for post-retirement benefits of Wapda employees.

The committee also suggested placing the authority under the Finance Division rather than the Cabinet Division.
During discussions on the government’s Virtual Assets Bill 2025, PMLN Senator Afnanullah Khan accused the Secretary of Law of plagiarism. He claimed that he had originally tabled the bill, which was later “copy-pasted” by the Ministry of Law and introduced as the government’s version.
“This is shameful,” he said, adding that the government’s draft was identical to the one he had proposed, which had been opposed by the government earlier.
 






Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, criticised the practice of the government claiming credit for draft laws initially proposed by members. He pointed out that such instances had occurred multiple times in the past, with the government only acting when parliamentarians introduced new bills. Senator Dilawar Khan likened the situation to someone claiming ownership of Mirza Ghalib’s poetry.
Secretary of Law Raja Naeem Akbar denied having seen Mr Khan’s private member bill until the Senate panel provided it. However, Senator Afnanullah maintained that the law minister had seen and opposed his bill when it was first introduced. He proposed a privilege motion in the Senate, accusing the Law Secretary of misleading Parliament by claiming the bill was never presented.

Recommends barring PVARA members from trading; proposes placing authority under Finance Division

The committee also recommended setting eligibility criteria for members and the chairman of PVARA, including a minimum of five years of experience and an age limit of 55 years. Senator Afnanullah suggested stronger safeguards for data privacy, and proposed that service providers be held accountable for privacy violations.
 
 

Senators Mandviwalla and Mohsin Aziz raised concerns over the $10,000 limit on virtual asset transactions, suggesting that there should be no such cap if the government is determined to regulate virtual assets.
The government had issued a presidential ordinance on July 8 to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and service providers. The regulator will have comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, and prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing, in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
PVARA’s board will include key government figures such as the State Bank’s governor, and the secretaries of finance, law, and information technology, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and Digital Pakistan Authority. Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance, or technology will also be appointed by the federal government.
 
 

Under the bill, any person or company wishing to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by PVARA. The bill outlines a structured licensing regime with specific requirements for operational capacity, compliance frameworks, and reporting obligations.
The bill aims to ensure investor protection, promote transparency, and foster innovation in the virtual asset market.
The government has also ensured that the regulatory framework will be compatible with Islamic finance principles by mandating the creation of a Sharia Advisory Committee to advise PVARA on Sharia compliance for virtual asset products and services.

In a set of proposals, the SCBA highlighted that open hearings will not only ensure internal accountability but also reaffirm the constitutional guarantee of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution.
Once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should conduct open proceedings subject to reasonable safeguards of dignity and decorum while deciding references within a fixed timeframe, preferably six months.
The 12-page set of proposals seeking to amend the SC Rules-2025 was furnished by SCBA President Mian Mohammad Rauf Atta and senior advocate Hafiz Ehsan Khokhar and were made known to the media at a press conference on Wednesday.

Set of proposals made public ahead of SC full court meeting

Considering the adverse reaction by the top lawyer’s bodies including the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and SCBA, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to suggest recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to provisions of the new rules.
The proposals will be taken up by the full court on Sept 8.
The written proposals request immediate withdrawal of recent increase in court fees, setting up a timeline for lawyers representing different parties to present arguments, deciding every case filed in the Supreme Court within a year, issuing orders of court proceedings the same day and reserved decisions within a month.
According to the set of proposals, suggestions were made to ensure the implementation of legal provisions under Articles 4, 10A, 25, and 37(d) that guarantee equality before law, fair trial, and the right to inexpensive and expeditious justice.
It was noted that as SC’s sanctioned strength has been enhanced to 35 judges, including the CJP, this moment presents a unique opportunity for structural reforms.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees, stating the recent increase in court fees should be withdrawn to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany where only nominal fees were charged.
One of the proposals deals with the right of audience for counsel by ensuring uninterrupted opportunities for lawyers to present their case, similar to structured models in Norway, France and Germany, while another asked for increase in working hours and urgent benches of the court as practised in India, the UK and the US.
The right of access to justice enshrined in Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution requires not merely the availability of judicial forums but also their effective and timely functioning, it was emphasised.
The pendency of cases before the SC that had reached unprecedented levels demands innovative approa­ches to maximise court’s productivity. One effective reform would be the extension of working hours for hearings and the creation of “late benches” dedicated to urgent matters such as bail, human rights petitions, election disputes and stay ap­­plications. Comparative practices il­­lustrate that this model has proven highly effective in other jurisdicti­o­­ns, the proposal said, adding the Su­­p­reme Court of India regularly constitutes vacation benches and late benches to address urgent relief during recess and after-hours sittings.
For Pakistan, the adoption of extended hours and urgent benches would not only address the backlog but also reinforce public confidence in the judiciary’s responsiveness, thereby fulfilling the constitutional promise that justice will be administered without delay or denial.
Another proposal stated the Arti­c­les 175 and 184 envisioned the Sup­r­e­me Court as the apex judicial auth­ority, with mandate to adjudicate ma­­tters of constitutional, tax, civil, criminal, and regulatory importan­­ce.
On cause list and adjournment of cases, the proposal asked for adopting India’s continuous listing and China’s AI-driven scheduling to curb adjournments.
It asked for the issuance of short orders the same day followed by detailed reasons, consistent with the practice in Germany, Turkiye, and France.
About digitisation, it asked for e-filing, online tracking, and automation modelled on systems in Singapore, China, and Norway.

The remarks were made during a press conference, where leaders of the political alliance criticised the government’s response to a natural disaster affecting numerous districts.
“Punjab is also facing severe floods, but the provincial government has completely failed,” said TTAP Secretary General Asad Qaiser, who was joined by Salman Akram Raja, Raja Nasir Abbas and others.
“Instructions have been passed that relief activities cannot be done without pictures of Maryam Nawaz. Only media campaign is going on and no relief has been provided.”

TTAP accuses officials of using relief efforts to run media campaign for CM

Mr Qaiser, stating that he also belongs to a flood-affected area, spoke of the human toll of the disaster. “I also belong to areas affected by flood and know a house in which 13 family members died,” he said.
He called for a comprehensive plan to build small dams and suggested that an emergency be declared. Mr Qaiser also blamed illegal housing societies for flooding in Lahore and urged the government to re-launch the Billion Tree Tsunami project to prevent disasters in future.
He contrasted the current situation with the 2022 floods, claiming the former PDM government sought international funds but failed to act. He also alleged the current Punjab government was preoccupied with social media.
“Punjab government was busy on TikTok and was doing nothing,” Mr Qaiser said, noting that livestock was suffering without care while officials were making visits to Japan instead of supporting the people.
 
 

Salman Akram Raja, who also spoke at the conference, warned of economic consequences. He said destroyed crops would lead to higher prices for rice and wheat.
“The import-export gap has been increasing due to which inflation will increase,” Mr Raja said.

• Move to have family courts hear polygamy cases gets full court nod
ISLAMABAD: Despite strong resistance from senior judges, a full court meeting of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adopted the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025.
The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two  judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
According to the agenda, the full court had been convened to deliberate on three key issues: amendments to the law related to polygamy, structural flaws in the IHC building, and the adoption of the service rules.
The meeting was attended by all 11 judges, including Chief Justice Sardar Moham­mad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Jus­tice Tariq Mehmood Jahan­giri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ish­aq Khan, Justice Khadim Hus­sain Soomro, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, Justice Moham­mad Azam Khan, Jus­t­ice Moham­mad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
Polygamy law, building flaws
Sources said the full court unanimously approved the amendment to the polygamy law, under which such cases will now be tried by family courts instead of executive magistrates.
It also decided to refer the IHC building case to the federal government for a thorough investigation into persistent issues. An inquiry conducted by the public works department earlier pointed out several defects in the elevators.
The inquiry report noted that the elevators lacked certain features promised in the prototype and the specifications, but it failed to identify those responsible for the fau­lty installation and maintenance.
Apart from the elevators, the IHC building continues to suffer from multiple problems, including an ineffective cooling system and inadequate parking facilities for litigants and lawyers.
The judges observed that instead of referring the matter directly to the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency, the federal government should be asked to carry out a comprehensive probe and take corrective measures.
CJ’s powers
Unlike these two agenda items, the proposed IHC Rules, 2025 triggered  a sharp division among the judges. While the chief justice strongly supported them, senior judges, including Justice Kayani, Justice  Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Imtiaz, opposed their adoption and urged amendments.
A day before the meeting, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had written letters to their colleagues, voicing serious concerns that administrative powers were being misused to sideline dissenting judges.
 
 

Both judges strongly objected to a new circular requiring judges to obtain a No-Objection Cert­ificate (NOC) from the chief justice for foreign travel.
They alleged that case assignments were being manipulated to benefit judges transferred to the IHC alongside the chief justice, while permanent judges who had opposed his transfer were being sidelined.
The letters also challenged the chief justice’s use of the “master of the roster” power to transfer part-heard cases.
Justice Khan also took exception to the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR), reminding his colleagues that PPR had already been gazetted without approval or even proper discussion by the full bench.
He noted the voluminous document, spanning more than 600 pages, had been provided only a day and a half before the meeting, reducing consultation to a mere formality and making meaningful input impossible.
Justice Khan dem­anded that five additional agenda items, including these objections, be formally taken up for “proper deliberations” in the full court meeting, signalling his refusal to let the controversy be ignored.
Voting and objections
According to sources, Chief Justice Dogar rejected any alteration in the agenda and proceeded to call a vote.
Six judges, including the chief justice, approved the rules, while five opposed them and resolved to record their objections in writing.
During the proceedings, the dissenting judges questioned whether those voting in favour had even read the new rules. The response, sources claimed, was negative.
Some judges, noting the massive length of the document, requested the chief justice to postpone the meeting, but their plea was turned down. Ultimately, the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were adopted by a razor-thin majority, leaving the full court deeply divided.

The ‘Rapid Needs Assessment’ report prepared by UN-OCHA says Buner recorded the largest losses of agricultural land with 1,157 acres affected, followed by Swat with 853 acres, Shangla with 559 acres, and Swabi with 330 acres.
Over 80 per cent of people reported crop losses which were significant in Battagram and Mansehra, while Lower Dir and Torghar reported smaller but notable losses, further threatening food security and livelihoods, the UN-OCHA report says.
People lost about 6,206 livestock across the affected areas of 10 districts. Buner reported the highest losses with 4,818 animals, followed by Swat with 618, Shangla with 295, Battagram with 219, and Swabi with 105. Smaller but significant losses were recorded in Bajaur, Mansehra, Torghar, and Upper Dir, while Lower Dir reported minimal impact.

Report says over 80pc of people reported crop losses; 6,206 livestock lost

The loss of livestock further weakened the livelihoods of rural households already facing crop damage and displacement.
Across most flood-affected areas, market access has remained relatively stable. Overall, 77 per cent of markets were reported as accessible, with full access in districts such as Bajaur, Battagram, Lower Dir, Tor Ghar, and Upper Dir.
Swat and Mansehra also reported high levels of access, showing that even in areas severely hit by floods, physical access to markets was somehow maintained. However, Buner had the lowest access at only 35 per cent, leaving people there with limited options for essential supplies.
Despite this physical access, food and non-food availability in markets remains a challenge across many districts.
 
 

The regular supply of essential commodities was disrupted in 55 per cent of the affected areas, with Swabi, Shangla, and Swat facing the most significant interruptions.
This means that while people in several districts can reach markets, goods they need are often either unavailable or supplied inconsistently, affecting food security and basic household needs.
Despite considerable efforts by the KP government and humanitarian actors, the assessment data reveals that many affected people continue to face critical gaps in assistance across multiple sectors.
Food assistance reached the largest proportion of affected households at 42 per cent overall, with significant support reported in Buner, Swabi, and Shangla districts.
However, in Battagram, Lower Dir, Torghar, and Upper Dir districts, people reported no or very limited food assistance. Similarly, health services were the second-most supported sector, reaching 39 pc of the affected population.
Major health interventions were reported in Buner (82pc), Swabi (50pc), and Shangla (22pc), but Torghar and Upper Dir districts reported no health assistance at all. In terms of shelter support, only 20 per cent of households reported receiving assistance.
Districts like Swabi (50pc) and Buner (31pc) reported the highest coverage, whereas most other districts reported minimal or no assistance despite extensive housing damages. Nutrition support was reported by just 15pc of people, largely concentrated in Buner (48pc), with almost no coverage in other districts, leaving children and pregnant women at risk.
The education sector was the least supported, with only 2pc coverage, despite widespread damage to school infrastructure in districts like Buner, Swat, and Shangla, potentially impacting thousands of children.
Overall, the data highlights that while food and health received the most attention, shelter, nutrition, and education remain critically underserved, requiring targeted and sustained interventions to bridge the assistance gaps across all affected districts.

• ‘Hot mic’ catches Xi and Putin discussing biotechnology, prospects of prolonging human life
• PM meets Chinese businessmen, tours Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital
BEIJING: President Xi Jinping warned the world was facing a choice between peace or war, as China showcased its military arsenal at a massive parade on Wednesday.
“Today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” Xi told a crowd of more than 50,000 spectators at Tiananmen Square, adding that the Chinese people “firmly stand on the right side of history”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sha­­r­if was also in attendance, alon­g­side Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and North Kor­e­an Leader Kim Jong Un, Iran­ian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, and a host of other world leaders.
The event to mark 80 years since Japan’s defeat at the end of World War II was designed to project China’s military might and diplomatic clout.
It managed to get a rise out of US President Donald Tru­mp, who wrote an acidic post on his Truth Social Platform.
“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” Trump added.
The Kremlin said Putin was not conspiring against the Uni­ted States and suggested Tru­mp was being ironic in his remarks.
Military hardware and a ‘hot mic’
Riding in an open-top limousine, Xi then inspected the tro­ops and cutting-edge military equipment such as hypersonic missiles, underwater dron­es and a weaponised ‘robot wolf’.
Helicopters trailing large banners and fighter jets flew in formation during a 70-minute showcase that culminated in the release of 80,000 ‘peace’ birds.
New underwater drones and supersonic missiles counted among the gear on display, as well as the ICBMs.
Donning a tunic suit in the style worn by former leader Mao Zedong, Xi earlier greeted more than 25 leaders on the red carpet, including Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto who made a surprise appearance despite widespread protests at home.
Seated between Putin and Kim in the viewing gallery during the parade, Xi repeatedly engaged in conversations with both leaders as thousands of troops and materiel passed before them. It marked the first time the trio have appeared together in public. At a lavish reception after the parade at the Great Hall of the People, Xi told his guests that humanity must not return to the “law of the jungle”.
Earlier, when Russian President Vladimir Putin walked shoulder to shoulder with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a hot mic caught them discussing organ transplants and the possibility that humans could live to 150 years old.
The moment was carried on the livestream provided by state broadcaster CCTV.
 
 

As Putin and Xi walked toward the Tiananmen rostrum where they viewed the parade with Kim, Putin’s translator could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”
The translator added, after an inaudible passage: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and (you can) even achieve immortality.”
In response, Xi, who was off camera, can be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”
Kim was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi, but it was not clear if the conversation was being translated for him.
PM Shehbaz’s schedule
On Wednesday, PM Shehbaz visited Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital, and directed Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to establish simple, robust and sustainable infrastructure at Islamabad’s under-construction hospitals, including Jinnah Medical Complex, to deliver high-quality medical facilities, modelled on Chinese standards.
 
 

He also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing to boost business-to-business (B2B) investment cooperation between the two countries.
The prime minister emphasized that industrial cooperation remains the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a defining pillar of the high-quality development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it enters into its second phase.
He invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into Special Economic Zones.

• PDMA chief fears renewed flooding in central Punjab as Indian dams near max capacity;
says ‘Ravi flowing backwards’ instead of merging with Chenab
• 3.7m affected across province, death toll jumps to 46; another massive surge expected at Multan tomorrow
LAHORE: As the confluence of the swollen Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal threatens the districts of Multan and Muzaffargarh, provincial authorities on Wednesday braced for an unprecedented disaster in light of a “dual threat”, which persisted despite several controlled breaches over the past week.
The water level at Muhammadwala and Sher Shah was recorded at 412 feet, only five feet below critical level. The authorities termed the next 12 hours critical, as the pressure at the breaching points continued to increase after the convergence of the Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal.
In order to save urban centres along the eastern rivers, the Punjab government has been following a policy of controlled breaches to relieve pressure on barrages and main embankments to protect densely populated cities. A decision on whether to conduct a breach at Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah Flood Bund, and Rangpur is expected within hours to save Multan and Muzaffargarh, with 17 points identified.
However, the situation in these two districts is compounded because of an enormous surge of approximately 550,000 cusecs that crossed the Marala and Khanki Headworks and was recorded passing through Qadirabad Headworks with an intensity of 530,000 cusecs. Officials projected that this powerful surge would reach Trimmu Headworks on Thursday and is expected to arrive in the Multan region by Friday.
“The next 12 hours are extremely critical,” stated a Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) official closely involved in crisis management. “We are facing a dual threat: the existing high water from the confluence of the rivers and a new, massive wave heading directly for us. All resources are being mobilised,” he said.
 
 

On the other hand, the railway traffic to Karachi and vice versa was suspended from Faisalabad after a bridge on a railway track on the Chenab River came under water in Abdul Hakim.
Flood warnings
In a press conference on Wednesday ev­­ening, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the flood crisis was set to intensify as all three major Indian dams were expected to reach their maximum capacity within the next 72 hours, exacerbating an already catastrophic situation in the Punjab river system. Addressing a press conference, DG Kathia revealed that his office had received three separate flood warnings in the past 24 hours alone.
He confirmed that while the water level in the Chenab River was currently stable, previously affected districts along its cou­rse were likely to face renewed flooding.
The Sutlej River has been in a flood-like condition for the past two months, while the Ravi River was experiencing rising levels at the Jassar monitoring point. “The next 72 hours are critical,” he stated.
“Thein Dam is already full and will continue to release water into the Ravi for the next two to three weeks. While the situation in Ravi will not be as severe as before, water levels will definitely increase.”
In an alarming development, the DG explained that instead of merging with the Chenab as normally expected, the Ravi’s waters are flowing backwards, preventing any decrease in its water levels. “Until water levels decrease at Ahmadpur Sial, we will not see any reduction at Sidhnai,” he clarified.
 

THIS map shows the locations of controlled breaches, carried out by authorities so far to save major urban centres in Punjab. According to PDMA, arrangements are in place to breach more dykes at Head Muhammadwala, Shershah and Rangpur.

The presser came after Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz conducted a personal assessment of the critical Head Muhammadwala site. DG Kathia said they were facing a major challenge here because it had only four to five feet of capacity remaining before reaching critical levels.
“At Sher Shah Bridge in Multan, there’s significant water pressure with only a two-foot margin remaining,” he revealed. “Im­­portant decisions regarding a controlled breaching in Multan have already been made to prevent uncontrolled overflow.”
