<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1120155251abc64.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219/govt-hails-hague-courts-award-saying-india-must-let-flow-waters-of-western-rivers-for-pakistans-unrestricted-use' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hails Hague court’s award saying India must ‘let flow’ waters of western rivers for Pakistan’s ‘unrestricted use’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
A press release issued today by the PCA said it rendered an award on Friday in an arbitration initiated by Pakistan against India on August 19, 2016, pursuant to Article IX and Annexure G to the IWT.
“This arbitration concerns the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India is permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers.”
Regarding the overall approach to Article 3 (provisions regarding western rivers) of the IWT, the award said: “The general rule is that India shall ‘let flow’ the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s unrestricted use.
“There are certain specified exceptions to this rule, including in relation to the generation of hydroelectric power, but these exceptions must be strictly construed: the design and operation of run-of-river hydroelectric plants must hew strictly to the requirements in the treaty, rather than to
what India might consider an ‘ideal’ or ‘best practices’ approach.”
It further noted that questions relating to the balance between the parties’ respective rights and obligations in this regard were to be identified and addressed through the treaty’s procedures for notification, objection and dispute resolution in furtherance of the treaty’s objective and its obligations of mutual cooperation.
 






The PCA said that to date, India had not participated in the arbitration proceedings and had repeatedly objected to the court’s competence of the court, adding that it had addressed the issue on various counts before.
“Throughout these proceedings, the court has ensured that India is fully informed in respect of the
proceedings and that the opportunity to participate remains open to it. Notwithstanding this, the court
has endeavoured to ascertain, understand, and consider India’s views, drawing on available materials,
including the records of the commission, correspondence between the parties, and/or submissions by
India in previous dispute resolution proceedings under the treaty,” the PCA said.
It added that it had also taken steps to test the accuracy of Pakistan’s claims, including by requesting further written submissions from Pakistan, by questioning Pakistan both before and during the hearing on the merits, by requesting that Pakistan produce historical evidence concerning the operation of the IWT and the Permanent Indus Commission, and by considering publicly available materials and jurisprudence not presented by Pakistan.
The PCA explained that the Aug 8 award addressed questions concerning the treaty’s overall interpretation and application, including in relation to Article 3 and Paragraph 8 of Annexure D (which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the western rivers).
“The award also addresses a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),” the PCA press release said.
“The award is binding on the parties and without appeal,” the press release stated.
A statement from the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan welcomed the award.
“The award carries special significance in the wake of India’s recent announcement to hold the IWT in abeyance, and its earlier decision to boycott the proceedings of the Court of Arbitration. It is an endorsement of Pakistan’s historical stance on the afore-stated issues.
“Pakistan remains committed to full implementation of the IWT. It also expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the treaty and faithfully implement the award announced by the Court of Arbitration.”
 






Award’s details
Among its 10 findings, the court said the awards of a court of arbitration were final, binding on the parties and had a controlling legal effect on subsequent neutral experts, subsequent courts of arbitration and the court that issued the award.
Further, it pointed out that to the extent that a court of arbitration and a neutral expert were operating at the same time on related matters, it was incumbent on both to pay attention to decisions of the other that had a binding or otherwise controlling effect.
The court said that the decisions of a neutral expert on matters within their competence were “final and binding” on the parties and any court of arbitration, in respect of the particular matter on which the decision was made.
“Due to the vulnerability of Pakistan as the downstream riparian of a critical but shared nature resource, and the potential for serious conflict between India and Pakistan in this regard, the object and purpose of the treaty, as it relates to the western rivers, is to delimit the two states’ respective rights and obligations, in conjunction with mutual cooperation and effective dispute resolution procedures for whenever questions as to the interpretation and application of these rights and obligations arise,” the court reiterated about the treaty’s objectives and aims.
The award said Paragraphs 8(d), 8(e), and 8(f) of Annexure D, on low-level outlets, gated spillways, and intakes for the turbines respectively, contained specific directions about their existence, size and/or location (addressed below), which might depart from engineering best practices that sought to maximise efficiency or power output.
“These limitations were of central significance in the treaty negotiations for addressing Pakistan’s
concerns as to India’s ability to release virtually all the water in dam reservoirs, along with
sediment, and to withhold a large volume of water when refilling the reservoirs,” the court said.
On maximum pondage, the award said that the pondage required for firm power was
to be calculated based on the water accumulated over a seven-day period at the minimum mean
discharge (a historically low flow rate), taking into account the daily and weekly downstream
release requirements set out in Paragraph 15 of Annexure D and a “realistic, well-founded, and
defensible projection of the plant’s installed capacity and anticipated load”.
It noted that maximum pondage should not be “more than twice this amount”.
The court further said that when designing a run-of-river plant, India was only entitled to freeboard the vertical distance in the dam wall from the full supply level to the top of the dam of a height necessary to address the safety of the dam as a whole from overtopping, with reference to internationally recognised standards.
“For each of the components of dam design indicated above, the parties must cooperate from an early stage of planning by India for a new hydro-electric plant on the western rivers, such that India’s designs can be modified as necessary in light of valid concerns raised by Pakistan in relation to these components. Ultimately, India bears the burden of establishing that its designs are treaty-compliant,” the award’s findings concluded.
However, the award clarified that the court did not address the application of its findings to the specific circumstances of the Kishenganga Hydro-Electric Plant or Ratle Hydro-Electric Plant — the two Indian
projects presented in Pakistan’s arbitration request.
“The court remains seized of issues raised in the request for arbitration and not yet decided, and will determine the next steps in the proceedings after seeking the views of the parties,” it said.</p><small>2025-08-11 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11203229b5f4647.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930217/foreign-office-slams-indias-mea-for-twisting-coas-asim-munirs-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office slams India’s MEA for ‘twisting’ COAS Asim Munir’s remarks</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday castigated India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for “distorting” and “twisting” remarks made by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during his recent visit to the United States.
Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his second high-profile trip to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command’s (Centcom) change of command ceremony.
His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.
Comments Field Marshal Munir reportedly made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock-in-trade.
“The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.”
The MEA had also said that it was “regrettable” that the alleged remarks were “made from the soil of a friendly third country”.
 






In a terse response to the Indian MEA’s statement, the FO said: “Pakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.
“The Indian narrative of an alleged ‘nuclear blackmail’ is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India’s sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.”
The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an “elaborate command and control structure under full civilian control” that had always exercised “discipline and restraint” while dealing with issues of such importance.
 






“Pakistan’s sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA’s spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.
“We also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India’s lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.”
The FO said that “contrary to India’s belligerent and jingoistic approach”, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.
“However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,” it warned.
The two countries had entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, and the PAF downed six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks. Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.  Trump also hosted the army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead end as Trump last week imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p><small>2025-08-11 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1116193318bf2a7.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930196/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-in-2-more-may-9-cases-convicts-dr-yasmin-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC acquits Qureshi in 2 more May 9 cases; convicts Dr Yasmin, Ejaz Chaudhry and others</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
 
 

The ATC had reserved its verdict in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots — the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House — after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.
PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.
Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today’s sentencing to Dawn.com.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Hamza said that the PTI leaders did not fear punishment and would not take one step back.
“We are standing with the PTI founder and will continue to stand with him,” she said. “I was in government custody when I was sentenced.”
She continued: “Maryam Nawaz was convicted because of corruption, while I was convicted because of loyalty. I have already served 16 months in prison, I am not afraid.”
Hamza stated that she was already consulting with her lawyers to file an appeal against the sentence with the Lahore High Court (LHC).
In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.
In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.
Last month, the Lahore ATC had acquitted Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.
Chaudhry had filed two petitions in the LHC on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
PTI’s Gohar blasts convictions
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the convictions, saying: “We’ve said before that if injustice is allowed to thrive, then the voice of the people will be silenced.”
Lamenting that the PTI’s mandate was stolen, Gohar said that the government did not have the people’s respect or vote and did not have the people’s trust.
“Yet we sat [in parliament] so that we could move forward and protect the nation, save democracy, free the courts and ensure the supremacy of order.
“If this blade of injustice doesn’t stop, the nation will suffer a great loss,” he warned.
“We condemn the judgments and reject them,” Gohar added. “Justice has been killed.”
The PTI chairman further said that the party condemned the riots on May 9, stating that they should not have happened and should not happen again. However, he added that the party submitted a petition requesting a hearing on the allegations.
“That hearing has not happened, our petition was ignored and no decision was made,” he stated.
“Because the courts didn’t grant us justice, political tensions and instability rose. We don’t get justice and it keeps getting killed,” Gohar emphasised.
He said that Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was saying the right thing: “People need to rise up, their voice cannot be silenced.
“We will carry on our movement until the true leader of the world’s 6th biggest party is released.”
Referring to those convicted in today’s hearing, Gohar said that the party members were voices who were representatives of the state who did not condone violence against it.
“If their voices are silenced, if the knife of injustice plunges deeper, then there will be a lot of division. This needs to end,” Gohar emphasised.
According to Gohar, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) summoned the party leadership, who requested a meeting with Imran. “He (the CJP) said he is pursuing judicial reforms and would allow us to meet Imran in Adiala,” Gohar recalled.
“It’s been six months and there has been no meeting. We submitted a privileged motion to meet Imran, but there has been no action on it.
“We even submitted requests and raised the issue in parliament, but nothing happened,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-11 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111707140e47b6b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930198/pakistan-gets-offers-in-100000-tonne-white-sugar-tender-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets offers in 100,000-tonne white sugar tender, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) on Monday received offers in its international tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of white sugar, European traders said in initial assessments.
On July 8, the government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
TCP had last week issued a fresh international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, after a previous one for 50,000 tonnes of sugar in July reportedly received no offers.
The lowest price offered in the tender was believed to be $539.00 a tonne, cost and freight (c&f) included, according to traders. They said offers were still being considered and no purchase had been reported yet.
The lowest offer was said to have been submitted by trading house ED&F Man for 50,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar sourced from any origin.
There were reportedly three other participants in the tender.
Dreyfus was said to have offered $580.75 a tonne c&f for 25,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar from any origin, while Al Khaleej Sugar offered $586.00 a tonne c&f for 30,000 tonnes of medium-grade sugar sourced from the United Arab Emirates.
Trading house Bare offered $555.00 c&f for medium-grade and $550.00 c&f for fine-grade sugar, both from Brazil.
Reports reflect the assessments so far from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.
 
 

No purchase was reported in a previous tender for 100,000 tonnes on July 31, with the lowest price offer also $539.00 a tonne c&f.
The new tender seeks small/fine- and medium-grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.
The sugar shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20, traders said.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1 to September 15 for 50,000 tonnes, while the rest can be shipped from September 10 to September 25. Sugar in ocean shipping containers can also be shipped between September 1 to 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
The government has vowed strict monitoring of sugar stocks and also placed some unidentified mill owners on the Exit Control List in a bid to stabilise rates.
A cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p><small>2025-08-11 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1119482504f6ab1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930218/bangladesh-court-hears-graft-case-against-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh court hears graft case against ex-PM Sheikh Hasina</strong></a><br><p>A court in Bangladesh on Monday heard cases brought by the anti-corruption organisation against ex-leader Sheikh Hasina and her family, including her daughter who has served as a top UN official.
Three officials from the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) read out testimonies in three separate cases over an alleged land grab of lucrative plots in a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
Hasina, 77, fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, after weeks of student-led protests against her autocratic rule.
She has defied orders to return from India, including to attend her separate and ongoing trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity, over the deadly crackdown on the uprising.
Hasina has been named in six corruption cases, along with her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, and her daughter Saima Wazed, who has been serving as the World Health Organisation’s Southeast Asia chief in New Delhi.
“If found guilty, Sheikh Hasina, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, and Saima Wazed could face up to 14 years in prison,” ACC lawyer Khan Mohammad Mainul Hossain told AFP.
Wazed is on leave from the WHO and a new official has taken up a post as “officer-in-charge”.
In total, six cases have been filed of alleged corruption connected to Hasina.
Among those named in other cases, some slated to be heard later in August, are Hasina’s sister, Sheikh Rehana, and her children — including British lawmaker Tulip Siddiq.
Tulip Siddiq resigned as the UK government’s anti-corruption minister in January, denying any wrongdoing after being named in multiple probes in Bangladesh.
Siddiq’s lawyers have said the allegations against her are false.</p><small>2025-08-11 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111753244a4aa3f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930199/world-assails-israels-killing-of-anas-al-sharif-other-gaza-journalists-as-mourners-gather-for-funeral' target='_blank'><strong>World assails Israel’s killing of Anas Al Sharif, other Gaza journalists as mourners gather for funeral</strong></a><br><p>Dozens of people in Gaza gathered on Monday for the funeral of five Al Jazeera staff members and a sixth reporter killed in an Israeli strike, in an attack which drew widespread condemnations from across the world.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
Anas Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four Al Jazeera journalists and an assistant who were killed in a “directed assault” on a tent opposite Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and Al Jazeera said. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike. A sixth journalist, Mohammad Al-Khaldi, a local freelance reporter, was also killed in the airstrike, according to medics at Al Shifa Hospital.
Mourners stood amid bombed-out buildings in the courtyard of Al Shifa hospital to pay their respects to Al Sharif and four of his colleagues.

The killings elicited intense criticism from governments and rights associations.
Pakistan
Pakistan said the “egregious attack constitutes yet another serious violation of international humanitarian and human rights law” and underscored the scale and severity of the crimes perpetrated by Israel.
“The government of Pakistan calls upon the international community to take immediate and decisive action to end Israeli impunity, ensure the protection of civilians, and hold Israel accountable for its actions,” said a statement from the Foreign Office.
 






Qatar
Qatar’s prime minister lambasted Israel for killing journalists, describing the deaths as “crimes beyond imagination”.
“The deliberate targeting of journalists by Israel in the Gaza Strip reveals how these crimes are beyond imagination … May God have mercy on journalists Anas Al-Sharif, Mohammed Qraiqea, and their colleagues,” Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said in a post on X.
 






UK
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was “gravely concerned” about the repeated targeting of journalists in Gaza, according to his spokesperson.
“We are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of journalists in Gaza,” Starmer’s spokesperson told reporters.
“Reporters covering conflicts are afforded protection under international humanitarian law, and journalists must be able to report independently, without fear, and Israel must ensure journalists can carry out their work safely.”
Asked about the claim that one of the journalists was linked to Hamas, Starmer’s spokesperson said: “That should be investigated thoroughly and independently, but we are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of journalists.”
UN
The UN human rights agency also condemned the killing, terming it a “grave breach of international humanitarian law”.
In a post on X, the office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said, “Israel must respect and protect all civilians, including journalists,” noting that at least 242 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began in October 2023.
“We call for immediate, safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists,” it added.
 






Iran
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei called on the world to hold Israel to account, Al Jazeera reported.
“A press badge is no shield against genocidal war criminals who fear the world witnessing their atrocities,” said Baghaei, accusing Israel of assassinating the journalists “in cold blood”.
“Strong condemnation is the bare minimum for any decent human being, but the world must act immediately to stop this harrowing genocide and hold the criminals accountable,” he added. “Indifference and inaction are complicity in Israel’s crimes.”
Reporters Without Borders
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the “acknowledged murder by the Israeli army” of  Al Sharif in Gaza.
Where Israel accused  Al Sharif of being a “terrorist” affiliated with Hamas, the press freedom campaign group told AFP he was “one of the most famous journalists from the Gaza Strip [and] the voice of the suffering Israel has imposed on Palestinians in Gaza.”
The NGO “strongly and angrily condemns the acknowledged murder by the Israeli army” of Al Sharif and other journalists, RSF added.
Committee to Protect Journalists
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.
“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said Sara Qudah, CPJ’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable,” Qudah added.
 






Freedom of the Press Foundation
The Freedom of the Press Foundation also condemned the killings, calling for international action to halt further attacks on the media, according to Al Jazeera.
“Everyone who has been angered by recent horrific images of starvation and suffering in Gaza needs to recognise that they wouldn’t see those images, and wouldn’t know about the atrocities their governments bankroll, without journalists risking their lives,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the New York-based nonprofit, said in a statement.
“That is exactly why Israel is targeting and killing them in violation of international law. Now, perhaps more than any other time since the killing began, the world understands how vital these journalists’ work is.
“The calls for the assassinations to end must be louder than ever, and we can’t let our leaders get away with mere expressions of concern or performative condemnations while the money and weapons Israel uses to exterminate journalists and other civilians keep flowing.”
Amnesty International
Amnesty International said the claims made by Israeli forces about Al Sharif were “entirely unsubstantiated and without evidence”, adding that they followed a pattern of similar claims and threats.
“Israeli forces have repeatedly branded journalists, aid workers, and healthcare workers in Gaza as ‘terrorists’, a pattern that has enabled the deliberate targeting and killing of these individuals with complete impunity.”
Amnesty called for an independent and impartial investigation into the killings of Palestinian journalists, with “justice and full reparation for their families”, saying that states must “urgently act to bring an end to Israel’s genocide now”.

The credibility of elections has rarely been questioned in recent decades in the world’s most populous democracy. Some analysts say the opposition accusations could damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he navigates one of the toughest periods of his 11 years in office.
The opposition members were taken into custody midway while marching from the parliament to the Election Commission of India (ECI) headquarters in New Delhi as they protested the roll revision, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Nearly two hours later, Congress lawmaker Kishori Lal Sharma said Gandhi and other opposition leaders had been released.
“The police detained us but now we have been released,” he told the media, adding that the police had not allowed them to go to the ECI as promised, and instead took them to the police station.
“We are now heading to the parliament,” he added.
 






As the police attempted to thwart the protest by around 300 opposition members, some MPs climbed up to the barricade — set up by the police ahead of the march — and chanted slogans against the ECI and Modi’s government. The protestors carried placards alleging “vote theft”, PTI said.
A statement posted on Gandhi’s X account shortly after he was detained said: “The truth of vote theft is now before the country.
“This fight is not political — it is a fight to protect democracy, the constitution, and the right to ‘one person, one vote’,” he added.
“The united opposition and every voter in the country demands a clean and transparent voter list,” the Congress leader added.
 






Gandhi and Congress have alleged that voters’ lists in states where the party lost are corrupted, with voters’ names deleted or included more than once to rig elections in favour of Modi’s BJP.
Opposition parties have also criticised the ECI’s decision to revise the voters’ list in the key northern state of Bihar just before state elections due later this year, saying it aims to disenfranchise large numbers of poor voters.
The BJP and the ECI have rejected the accusations.
In June, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter rolls was announced ahead of the upcoming polls in the eastern state of Bihar. The move, which required that all potential voters provide proof of citizenship by July 25, sparked nationwide fears of disenfranchisement among India’s minorities, including Muslims and Dalit communities.
 
 

According to PTI, other protesting lawmakers detained included Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, T. R. Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress.
Parliamentarians from other opposition parties, such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal, were also taken into custody, the report added.
‘State of anarchy’
The ECI has said that changes in voters’ lists are shared with political parties and all complaints are investigated thoroughly.
It has also said that voters’ lists need to be revised to remove dead voters or those who have relocated to other parts of the country, among others. Many voters in Bihar have told the BBC that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people.
“The new draft rolls have 72.4 million names — 6.5 million fewer than before,” the BBC report published today said.
Congress and its allies have fared poorly in two state polls that they had expected to win after an impressive show in last year’s general elections, which saw BJP losing its outright majority and remaining in power only with the help of regional parties.
 
 

Congress has also complained about electronic voting machines and said the counting process is not fair, charges rejected by the election panel.
The BJP said opposition parties were trying to create a “state of anarchy” by sowing seeds of doubt about the electoral process.
“They are in a state of bankruptcy because of their continuous losses,” Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of the BJP told reporters on Monday.
 






As per the PTI report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had written to the ECI earlier and asked them to hold discussions over the electoral rolls’ SIR, among other issues.
“Thereafter, the MPs wish to collectively meet with the commission on a host of issues, including but not limited to Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls being undertaken in Bihar and proposed to be undertaken in other states as well,” the PTI quoted him as saying.
“We look forward to meeting with the commission, which will be in keeping with the highest tradition of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, according to PTI.</p><small>2025-08-11 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11174901100527b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930203/suspect-in-lawyer-khawaja-shamsul-islams-murder-arrested-from-kp-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect in lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam’s murder arrested from KP: police</strong></a><br><p>Police have arrested a suspect from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in connection with the recent killing of senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said on Monday.
Islam was shot dead while his son was injured as they were leaving a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on August 1. Darakshan Police registered a case the next day against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges.
DIG Raza told Dawn.com that the vehicle in which the suspect fled the scene of the murder was also recovered by police.
“Investigators have mapped the suspect,” the DIG said. “According to the evidence we gathered, he fled on a motorcycle alone.
“Police have also unearthed a bungalow in DHA being used by the suspects. CCTV footage obtained from the bungalow showed their activities before and after the lawyer was killed.”
According to the South police chief, investigators have so far obtained 30 pieces of CCTV footage of the suspects.
“With the help of human intelligence, police raided the residences of the suspects’ relatives in Karachi and detained several people for interrogation,” he added.
“With the help of Hotel-ID, the suspects were spotted in Hyderabad, from where their relatives were also detained. Through technological sources, police found that the suspects had fled to KP, from where one suspect was arrested,” said the DIG.
DIG Raza said that of the eight suspects nominated in the murder case, one was already in jail.
“The police have requested the court to investigate the imprisoned suspect,” he said. “Police are in constant touch with the family of the deceased lawyer, while guards have been deployed at their residence in DHA for security.”
This was not the first time that the lawyer was attacked by the prime suspect, as in November last year, he allegedly attacked the lawyer with 15-20 other accomplices.
According to the lawyer’s brother, Islam was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.</p><small>2025-08-11 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11162110a6ca15b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930195/indian-top-court-orders-roundup-of-stray-dogs-in-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>Indian top court orders roundup of stray dogs in Delhi</strong></a><br><p>India’s Supreme Court on Monday ordered the removal of tens of thousands of stray dogs from the capital, citing public safety concerns after a surge in dog bites.
India is home to millions of stray dogs and deadly attacks, particularly on children and the elderly, are regularly reported by the city’s media.
At least 60,000 stray dogs live on the streets of Delhi, according to India’s Livestock Census of 2012, the most recent data available. Some suggest that number to be now far higher, with large rival dog packs patrolling parks and residential neighbourhoods across the city.
The country accounts for more than a third of global rabies deaths, according to the World Health Organisation, a crisis exacerbated by a lack of sterilisation programmes and legal restrictions on canine culling.
The court asked city authorities to set up dog shelters within eight weeks, and maintain daily records of the canines captured.
“What is important, and without which the entire exercise would go futile, not a single stray dog should be released,” it said, which applies to Delhi and its satellite suburbs, a megacity home to some 30 million people.
The court warned of action against animal activists who obstruct the removal of dogs.
It also ordered a 24-hour helpline to be set up to report dog bites and officials must publicise locations where anti-rabies vaccines are available.
Data tabled in the Indian parliament showed more than 3.7m cases of dog bites and 54 suspected human deaths from rabies in 2024.
 
 

Other estimates peg the number to be nearly twice as high, with Delhi alone accounting for roughly 2,000 cases of dog bites every day.
In middle-class neighbourhoods, many of Delhi’s strays are beloved by their residents despite lacking formal owners, with some dogs clothed in special canine jackets to keep warm during the winter.
But they are also a hazard to humans, with Indian media regularly reporting on the mauling of young children by aggressive dog packs.</p><small>2025-08-11 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11121730968ffc9.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930166/mazhab-nahi-soch-badlo-religious-minorities-seek-end-to-forced-conversions-intolerance' target='_blank'><strong>‘Mazhab nahi, soch badlo’: Religious minorities seek end to forced conversions, intolerance</strong></a><br><p>“I have a problem with the use of the term ‘minority’. It only serves to otherise religious groups within the country and reinforce existing divides. We are all equal citizens of Pakistan.”
Christians like Pastor Daniel were among hundreds gathered at Karachi’s YMCA on Sunday for the Minority Rights March, which, ironically, was celebrated a day earlier since “minorities wouldn’t get a day off to celebrate it”.
Jinnah’s oft-quoted speech of Pakistani citizens being free to go to temples and places of worship remains relegated to the history textbooks since the lived realities for religious minorities across Pakistan are far from that freedom once promised.
“Christians like me aren’t allowed to preach their religion, and seldom can we practice it without the fear of the supposed majority,” said Daniel of Karachi’s Philadelphia Pentecostal Church.
Jinnah’s speech and his very upbringing were woven through the day’s itinerary. The speakers emphasised that his early education was at schools founded by religious minorities, to whom these schools now remain largely inaccessible.
Sunday’s march centred around two main demands: the denationalisation of educational institutions, and an end to forced conversions.
“The biggest discrimination against the Christian community and minority communities in general is that the institutions we built, the institutions that equipped Jinnah to become Quaid of the country, have now been captured under elitist policies and are inaccessible to the general minority population,” Luke Victor, an organiser at the march, told Dawn.com.

Victor explained that the denationalisation policy has been in place for the past 40 years, but educational institutions still haven’t been returned to the church administration.
“We have a right under Article 22 to manage our own institutions, but the nationalisation policy is ultra vires of that,” Victor explained. Article 22 of the Constitution outlines “safeguards as to educational institutions in respect of religion”.

“It’s sort of a robbery of our heritage, of our educational institutions.”

Other speakers emphasised how former premier Benazir Bhutto was empowered by her alma mater, Karachi Grammar School — founded by the city’s first chaplain, Reverend Henry Brereton — but it hardly has any Christian students today.
“Systemic discrimination and biased policies have kept minorities away from institutions they once founded and thrived in. They now face a state-created cycle of educational exclusion,” a post on the Minority Rights March’s official X account said.
On the other hand, Christian-founded public schools like the YMCA lie vacant and misused after being brought under government control as part of the nationalisation policy.
Several points made at the march were amplified speeches of a robust social media campaign that the Minority Rights March team had begun ahead of the event. #EducationForAll, #GiveBackOurInstitutions, #StopForcedConversions and #MeraMazhabMeriMarzi were just some of the hashtags across the team’s social media, which were spotted on posters too.
“The state has stolen our educational institutions from us,” one speaker chanted to applause from a colourful sea of participants dressed in quintessentially Sindhi chunri prints, munching on papad and bhel sold by vendors who followed the crowd as they marched to the Arts Council Chowk. The crowd was a microcosm of what minority communities in Pakistan tend to look like: intergenerational, close-knit, small but mighty.
End to forced conversions
One of the many slogans reverberating through the crowd of 500-something
people was ‘mazhab nahi, soch badlo’ (change your mindset, not religion), which called for an end to forced conversions of Hindu girls.

“If you can’t get a driver’s licence or own a gun before the age of 18, then why are forced conversions allowed before that age?” asked one speaker who runs a private shelter for young minority girls who were forcibly converted.
The state’s failure in this case is two-pronged; on the one hand, it fails to protect religious minorities from being forcibly converted. On the other hand, the police refuse to recover those who have been abducted and converted, claiming the girls have now embraced Islam and the parents must stop seeking their recovery.
According to a study by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Sindh, a province that is host to the largest Hindu population in the country, has seen a mass exodus of Hindus towards India.
“We have a total of 11 demands today, the foremost being an end to forced conversion of Hindu girls,” said organiser Rampal Singh, who donned a sea-green turban and white kurta shalwar, standing in solidarity with his Hindu brethren.
“This is not a protest but a celebration for us,” Singh proclaimed, vowing to stand with his Muslim brothers on August 14 as “they are standing with us today”.
“I am a son of this soil, and all we are asking today is that, please hear us out and our issues.”
Suhani Naveej, of the Jaguti Foundation, detailed her work on the issue of forced conversion. “Many Hindu parents are now refusing to get their daughters’ CNIC cards made lest it be used as evidence in a court, declaring her a legal adult if she is ever abducted and forcibly converted.”
Naveej believed that the state’s apathy towards the plight of Hindu girls often leaves them vulnerable to social and educational inequalities.
“The lack of a CNIC card severely impacts the future prospects of the girls, barring them from accessing education and healthcare, among other basic facilities,” Naveej said.

Still, the activist remained hopeful. Through her work, she aims to rebuild the Hindu community’s trust in state institutions. She has repeatedly called on the state to support her efforts in bridging the divide that has taken root only due to the state’s negligence.
While expressing despair at the state of forced conversions, activist and organiser Najma Maheshwari said: “Today is supposed to be a day of celebration for us, but instead, we are forced to protest for our basic rights, and for our daughters to not be taken away.”
Voluntary migration also has its roots in religious discontent. Several nurses belonging to religious minorities flee the country due to workplace harassment, which Pastor Naomi Bashir urged the government to end, as well as address the severe shortage of nurses in Pakistan.
‘Apna kachra khud uthao’
There was an almost palpable distaste from the crowd when speakers addressed the synonymity of sanitary workers with religious minorities, particularly Christians and Hindus, who are often referred to as “churra” and “bhangi” (derogatory terms used for cleaners).
“We always see that job listings for sanitary work or Khakrob, exclusively ask for non-Muslims. Such actions constitute and promote systemic exclusion against religious communities, pushing them towards the margins,” Jagruti Foundation’s co-founder Sanjana Kumar told Dawn.com.
Jagruti Foundation is an initiative which aims to promote education in underserved communities.
Kumar, among many others at the march, questioned the discrimination, asking if cleanliness is “half of faith, then why does the responsibility of it fall solely on religious minorities?”
“Is that why we voted to be a part of Pakistan? So we could pick up trash?” one organiser asked as she spurred the crowd to chants of “shame, shame”.

The day’s doom and gloom was replaced by crowds dancing and swaying to a harmonium player singing Damadam Mast Qalandar as the sun broke through a cloudy sky that shielded the crowd from otherwise unbearable heat.
“Chant louder so that it reaches the place where laws are passed,” one of the organisers said as he gestured to the Sindh Assembly behind him, the first legislature to pass a resolution in favour of creating Pakistan.
“We lived here before Pakistan was formed, and we will continue to live here, because, to us, this land’s significance is equivalent to that of our mother”, Maheshwari said.
“We have been fighting all our lives, and we will continue until our last breath.”

The suspension of services between New Delhi and Washington, DC, marks the latest setback for Air India, which is facing heightened regulatory scrutiny after a June crash in Ahmedabad killed 260 people.
The planned shortfall in Air India’s fleet and continued closure of airspace over Pakistan have impacted the airline’s long-haul operations, leading to longer flight routings and increased operational complexity, the carrier said.
 
 

The airline has undertaken a $400 million retrofit programme to upgrade its fleet.
It, however, sees the Pakistan airspace ban costing it $600m over 12 months, Reuters had earlier reported.
India and Pakistan closed their respective airspaces to each other days after relations between the arch-rivals nosedived following a fatal attack on civilians in Indian-occupied Kashmir, which also sparked the worst fighting between the neighbours in decades.
New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for the attack, accusations which Islamabad has denied.
Air India said its flyers will have options to choose flights to Washington DC, with layovers at New York, Newark, Chicago and San Francisco with the airline’s interline partners Alaska Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.</p><small>2025-08-11 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1116055391dfebd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930192/india-estimates-about-55pc-of-goods-exported-to-us-will-face-trump-tariff' target='_blank'><strong>India estimates about 55pc of goods exported to US will face Trump tariff</strong></a><br><p>About 55 per cent of India’s merchandise exports to the United States will be subject to the tariff imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration, the Indian government said on Monday.
Last week, Trump imposed an additional 25pc tariff on Indian goods as punishment for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. That raised the total duty on Indian exports to the US to 50pc — among the highest on any American trading partner.
The Indian government had taken into account the 25pc tariff that Trump initially imposed on goods while providing Monday’s estimate, Pankaj Chaudhary, India’s junior finance minister, said in a written response to a question from a lawmaker.
“The Department of Commerce is engaged with all stakeholders, including exporters and industry, for taking feedback of their assessment of the situation,” Chaudhary added.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, a day after Trump announced 50pc tariffs on Indian goods.
New Delhi also put on hold its plans to procure new US weapons and aircraft, according to three Indian officials familiar with the matter, in India’s first concrete sign of discontent after tariffs imposed on its exports by President Trump dragged ties to their lowest level in decades.
 
 

According to a Reuters report, officials on both sides said a mix of political misjudgment, missed signals and bitterness broke down the deal between the two countries.
Goods trade between the US and India — the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, respectively — was worth about $87 billion in the last fiscal year, according to Indian government estimates.
US spending drives around 2.5pc of India’s GDP, according to Shilan Shah of Capital Economics.
But a 50pc tariff is “large enough to have a material impact”, he added, with the resulting drop in exports meaning the economy would grow by closer to 6pc this year and next, down from the 7pc they currently forecast.</p><small>2025-08-11 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11123818001ffd6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930169/award-winning-al-jazeera-journalist-anas-al-sharif-4-colleagues-killed-in-targeted-israeli-airstrike' target='_blank'><strong>Award-winning Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, 4 colleagues killed in targeted Israeli airstrike</strong></a><br><p>Prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, who had previously been threatened by Israel, and four colleagues were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, in an attack widely condemned by media and rights groups.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four Al Jazeera journalists and an assistant who were killed in a “directed assault” on a tent opposite Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and Al Jazeera said. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike.
A sixth journalist, Mohammad Al-Khaldi, a local freelance reporter, was also killed in the airstrike, medics at Al Shifa Hospital said on Monday.
Calling Al Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”, Al Jazeera said the attack was a “desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza”.
The other journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, and photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher and Mohammed Noufal.
 






“The deliberate targeting of journalists by Israel in the Gaza Strip reveals how these crimes are beyond imagination,” Qatar’s Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, said on X.
The UN human rights office condemned the killing of the journalists, saying the actions by Israel’s military represented a “grave breach of international humanitarian law” as Palestinians reported the heaviest bombardments in weeks.
Its post on social media platform X was accompanied by a photograph of flattened blue tents next to a bullet-ridden wall in Gaza City.
 






Israel’s military admitted it targeted and killed Al Sharif, alleging he had headed a Hamas cell and “was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians” and troops.
Al Jazeera rejected the claim and said that before his death, Al Sharif had also dismissed earlier claims by Israel that he was connected to Hamas.
The Qatar-based outlet held the “Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists”.
“This follows repeated incitement and calls by multiple Israeli officials and spokespersons to target the fearless journalist Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues,” it noted.
“Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices in Gaza conveying the tragic reality to the world,” Al Jazeera said.
 






A press freedom group and a United Nations expert previously warned that Al Sharif’s life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel’s claims against him were unsubstantiated.
 






Al Sharif was previously part of a Reuters team, which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of Israel’s military onslaught on Gaza.
Amnesty Australia also recognised him with a Human Rights Defender Award in December 2024.
Al Sharif, whose X account showed more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform minutes before his death that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.
In a pre-written message released on his X account after his killing, Al Sharif lambasted those who remained silent and called on the world to speak for Palestine.
“… I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing,” he said.
“I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland,” Al Sharif added.
 






Last October, Israel’s military had named Al Sharif as one of six Gaza journalists it alleged were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing documents it said showed lists of people who completed training courses and salaries.
“Al Jazeera categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces’ portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence,” the network said in a statement at the time.
The Gaza government media office said 237 journalists have been killed since Israel’s onslaught started on Oct 7, 2023, of which 186 have been confirmed by CPJ as well.
Dawn, corroborating details from various credible sources, has compiled a list of over 250 slain journalists.
Media bodies slam Israel’s killing of journalists
Journalists’ groups and Al Jazeera denounced the killings.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.
“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said Sara Qudah, CPJ’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable,” Qudah added.
 






“Israel’s ongoing campaign of targeted assassinations of Palestinian journalists is a war crime, plain and simple,” said National Executive Director Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a statement.
“The murder of these Al Jazeera journalists is not an accident or collateral damage — it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.
The Freedom of the Press Foundation also condemned the killings, calling for international action to halt further attacks on the media, according to Al Jazeera.
“Everyone who has been angered by recent horrific images of starvation and suffering in Gaza needs to recognise that they wouldn’t see those images, and wouldn’t know about the atrocities their governments bankroll, without journalists risking their lives,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the New York-based nonprofit, said in a statement.
“That is exactly why Israel is targeting and killing them in violation of international law. Now, perhaps more than any other time since the killing began, the world understands how vital these journalists’ work is.
“The calls for the assassinations to end must be louder than ever, and we can’t let our leaders get away with mere expressions of concern or performative condemnations while the money and weapons Israel uses to exterminate journalists and other civilians keep flowing.”
US Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called on the United States to stop providing weapons for this genocide“ in Gaza.
“The Israeli military has killed more than 200 journalists and media workers,” Jayapal highlighted on X.
 






The Palestinian mission to the UN said the journalists had “systematically and dutifully exposed and documented Israel’s genocide and starvation” in Gaza.
 






Hamas said the killing may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.
“The assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,” Hamas said in a statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would launch a new offensive to dismantle Hamas strongholds in Gaza, where a hunger crisis is escalating after 22 months of conflict.</p><small>2025-08-11 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111207008cf9b3f.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930162/7-dead-6-injured-in-gbs-danyor-as-landslide-hits-volunteers-restoring-water-supply' target='_blank'><strong>7 dead, 6 injured in GB’s Danyor as landslide hits volunteers restoring water supply</strong></a><br><p>At least seven volunteers died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and melting glaciers have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 deaths have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists missing.
Thirteen volunteers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.
“Thirteen volunteers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,” Gilgit’s Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
 
 

Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.
Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told Dawn.com that the bodies and injured had been moved to “various hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor”.
On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah inundated residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.
Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.
A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of volunteers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.
An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. “Our hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,” Faraq said.
Residents protest against govt ‘inaction’

Funeral prayers were later held for the volunteers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.
“The families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,” CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.
Social activist Ghulam Abbas also blamed the government’s alleged negligence, explaining that the incident might not have occurred if the government had restored the water channel.
Abbas also said that besides the seven volunteers who died in the landslide, one had lost his life due to a heart attack.
Dildar Hussain, another resident, called the incident “regrettable”. Echoing others’ complaints of damages caused by floods, he said, “No one did anything for restoration.”
“This situation is proof of government incompetence,” he said. “The responsibility for the lives lost lies with the government,” Dildar asserted.
Prominent lawyer Wazir Ibadat said that despite crops and trees being destroyed by the flooding, the water management had done nothing to restore the channel.
Ibadat said that people had to start the restoration work themselves, and as a result, precious lives were lost. He demanded an investigation into the matter and action against those responsible.

National Minorities Day is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion. The day aims to highlight the religious and socio-economic rights of minorities in Pakistan.
In separate addresses today, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz both reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding and advancing the rights of minorities while acknowledging their contributions to the country.
The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue efforts to promote interfaith harmony, brotherhood and unity to build an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.
“This day reflects Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s vision of a Pakistan where every citizen lives in equality, harmony, and mutual respect,” he said, according to a press release.
 






The president said that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights to all citizens “irrespective of religion, caste, creed, or colour”, and that it safeguarded the political, economic, religious, social and cultural rights of minorities.
“Pakistan stands resolutely against all forms of discrimination, extremism, and religious intolerance,” he stressed. “We remain determined to build a society free from prejudice — one that embraces diversity as a strength and is anchored in mutual respect, interfaith harmony, and shared progress.”
He added that the day was also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of the minority communities to nation-building, saying that they had served the country with dedication in the armed forces, judiciary, civil services, education and healthcare.
Their patriotism and service remained a “source of pride for the entire nation”, he added.
The president noted measures taken by the country for the welfare and empowerment of minorities, including the establishment of the National Commission for Minorities, allocation of a Minorities Welfare Fund, restoration and preservation of places of worship and provision of scholarships and financial assistance to minority students.
“We continue to promote interfaith dialogue and ensure meaningful participation of minorities in every sphere of national life,” he added.
In a separate statement, PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the full inclusion of minorities in government institutions, the parliament and the national mainstream while appreciating their role in the country’s development and progress.
“Pakistan is proud of its minorities’ patriotism, professional hard work and attachment to national heritage and culture,” he said.
“The welfare and well-being of all minorities in Pakistan, be they Sikhs, Christians, Hindus [or] Parsis, is one of the priority duties of the government of Pakistan,” the premier said.
 






He emphasised the services rendered by minorities “in every walk of life”, including those who had sacrificed their lives defending Pakistan.
“We pay tribute to them from the bottom of our hearts,” he said.
The PM also stressed that protecting minority rights, aside from a constitutional obligation, was also a religious duty. “Islam specifically advocates the protection of civil, religious and social rights of minorities. Ulema and religious leaders play a key role in protecting religious freedom,” he said.
He called on all Pakistanis to practise unity and solidarity, mutual respect and tolerance.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also acknowledged National Minorities Day, appreciating the role of minorities in the development of the country.
“The true strength and beauty of Pakistan lies in its diversity,” he said in a post on social media, calling the safeguarding and respecting of minority rights an “unbreakable pillar of the country’s democratic vision”.
“Our struggle is for a Pakistan where no citizen feels isolated or unsafe due to their religion, but where bonds of brotherhood rise above prejudice.”
 






Statements were also made by Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
Tarar called the occasion a “solemn reminder of our shared responsibility to ensure that every citizen of Pakistan enjoys equality, justice, and respect, irrespective of faith”.
He echoed the messages of the PM and president, emphasising the vision of the country’s founding father for a state “where religion would never hinder the rights, dignity, or equal standing of its people”, as well as Islamic teachings to “uphold justice without exception”.
“Let us pledge to build a Pakistan where diversity is celebrated, unity is our strength, and justice remains our guiding principle”, the minister said.
Meanwhile, CM Murad condemned intolerance against minorities and reaffirmed the province’s commitment to peaceful co-existence.
 






“Our beloved Sindh has always been tolerant and progressive in terms of religious freedom,” he said while addressing a gathering at a Hindu temple in Karachi. During his speech, he compared the province to “intolerant” Western democracies.
“In our province, across the board, we condemn actions against minorities because we are the land of Sufis,” he said, adding, “The Sufis of Sindh have always given the same lesson, which is that we should all co-exist in peace and harmony.
“I am happy to see today that our Hindu, Sikh and Parsi brothers are standing and celebrating the day together.”
He reaffirmed that the government of Sindh would “always stand with minorities” and that action would always be taken against any “unfortunate incident” against minorities in Sindh.
On Sunday, the Sindh Workers Welfare Board decided to extend its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.
 
 

However, despite the leadership’s statements, religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of mob attacks, forced conversions and blasphemy cases, as noted by the European Union’s Sebastien Lorion.
Last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das acknowledged that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.
According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been approved by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.</p><small>2025-08-11 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111137137f6aa74.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930158/why-you-should-care-about-the-atc-verdict-that-condemns-senate-na-opposition-leaders-to-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Why you should care about the ATC verdict that condemns Senate, NA opposition leaders to jail</strong></a><br><p>The opposition has been convicted. Its leaders in both houses of Parliament have been sentenced to a decade in jail, along with over a hundred other members of their political party. They and seven other opposition parliamentarians have been removed from their elected offices. If you were to apply these words to any country on the planet, most people reading would immediately understand this to be a shameless power grab by an authoritarian status quo; the work of an insecure and dictatorial mindset that treats the will, dissent, and collective intelligence of its own people with ruthless contempt.
But I am intentionally making no such statement here. For now, I’d like to focus instead on one simple, apolitical, and logical question — what did the judgment actually say?
Even if you are not invested in law or politics, it is in your interest to keep an eye on how your judicial system treats others. Not just because that is how it could one day treat you, but because these judgments are representative of where we are as a country, to what extent our rights are enforced, and how we are viewed and treated by those in power.
The convictions in this case, no. 832/ 2023, were delivered by the Anti-Terrorism Court Faisalabad in a 71-page judgment on July 31 written in language far too long and technical to appeal to the average citizen. But I read it, so you don’t have to, and the following aims to be an objective, open-minded analysis.
The verdict
Much about the heart of this document is unravelled in its opening paragraphs. Consider the language it uses to describe how the May 9 protests began: “On the asking of leadership of PTI, the mob became furious …”. This was presented not as an allegation, but as fact. And there is more at play here than the assumption that people can develop emotions purely because someone “asked” them to (the possibility that fully grown adults might hold their own opinions didn’t even warrant consideration here).

A critical and complex legal question — to what extent can the leaders of a party be held responsible for the subsequent actions of its supporters, and how strong is the evidence for that link in this case — stood answered by the Judge before either side’s arguments were even addressed.

Further down, the evidence presented by the prosecution consists overwhelmingly of social media content, speaking of piles of screenshot printouts and USBs filled with YouTube and TikTok videos purported to be inflammatory. This point would have been much stronger if the witnesses had quoted the specific words spoken by the accused which constituted incitement to violence. In the absence of this, we are expected to trust blindly. To be fair, there is some strong evidence on the record as well, such as photographs of damages and injuries, the recovery of destroyed items, and eyewitnesses to firing, destruction of property, and violence against police officers. This establishes that property damage and violence was indeed done by some people on the ground. But it does not address the question of whether this was specifically ordered or pre-planned as part of a conspiracy. To deal with this point, enter witness 19.
The ‘witness’
He is a sub-inspector who apparently narrated a story of “instigation and abetment” committed at Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence during meetings on the 7th and 9th of May. This poses an obvious question — how did Mr Sub Inspector listen in to what was said at a high-level meeting between the former prime minister and his party leadership? In his own house? Twice?
One of the attendees of this meeting, former federal minister Hammad Azhar has claimed that the sole evidence relied upon here was that an officer was hiding under a table. And another was behind the curtains.
 






As ridiculous as that sounds, the story presented in the ATC’s judgment is even worse — absolutely nothing. We are explicitly told at paragraph 25 that two officers heard for themselves what was said during the Zaman Park meetings, but not a word as to how. They heard violent calls to anarchy, noted down the names of the 41 politicians in the room, and nominated all of them before the court. Simple.
The next evidence of a conspiracy presented to us is the report of “a secret meeting” that took place at the Rose Hotel in the motorway rest area of Chakri on May 4. At paragraph 24, we are told that an Inspector was informed of this meeting and told everything that was said in it by “a secret source”. Whether there could be a more flimsy and vague recount of evidence in a criminal trial is difficult to imagine.
On allegations of political victimisation
The judgment acknowledged that the people accused of hatching the conspiracy claim political victimisation; that they are being brutally harassed by the legal system from multiple directions, and that it is all to punish their party affiliation and break them into submission. It noted that they all plead not guilty.
And then it moved on to the 2023 film, ‘Money Back Guarantee’, starring Fawad Khan and Ayesha Omar. Fawad Chaudhry was busy attending the premiere, so he couldn’t have been at the conspiracy meeting. The rest of the accused apparently did not appear in court to present their defence. Whether it is more accurate to say did not or could not, I leave to you. But the priorities here appear clear.
 
 

Later in the judgment, it does finally address the claims of political victimisation. At the end of paragraph 27, it states: “If it was the case as asserted by present accused persons of abetment and conspiracy then why the all [sic] prominent leaders of PTI were not dragged for alleged conspiracy and abetment …”. One struggles to find polite words to address an argument as weak as this one. But to put it simply, if you are actively locking up 100 members of the country’s largest opposition party, it is not enough to say, “at least I’m not arresting the rest of them”. Serious claims of victimisation like those made here ought to be addressed by a court in appropriate detail, and not in a single dismissive sentence.
An ode to the Raj
From this point onwards in the judgment, law takes a backseat, and we are taken on a journey through subcontinental history and moral philosophy. In a strangely counterintuitive point to bring up, it recalls in paragraph 28 that the sections of the penal code it is currently using to lock up the opposition were inserted by Lord Macaulay, a British coloniser, to lock up his opposition. It then goes on to compare May 9 with “the famous mutiny of 1857”, using colonial language for a historical event that we ordinarily refer to as the first war of independence, and reminding us that following this, “mass violation of these laws was seldom made by the masses in their own countries …”.
One wonders why on Earth such a comparison would be inserted into a criminal law judgment, or whether its implications were truly understood. Is the ATC Faisalabad comparing PTI protestors to the brave freedom fighters of the subcontinent who revolted against their colonisers? Is it comparing itself or someone else to the British Raj? If not, what did it possibly gain, or what legal point did it strengthen by adding these thoughts?
 
 

A short and sweet paragraph 29 asserts that the fact that a huge number of events took place on May 9, in almost all major cities, “shows that these events were organised and minutely and carefully planned with well thought out strategy and intentional design”. But to assume that the existence alone of mass protest is enough to prove its meticulous planning is in defiance of both history and logic.
Did the massive and occasionally violent protests against the murder of George Floyd across all major cities of America have one mastermind meticulously planning them out? What about the uprising against Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania? Or even, to use this judgment’s own example, the first war of independence in 1857? It is of course, not outside the realm of possibility that this or any protest could have a degree of planning involved behind the scenes that is not known to the public. But if this is to be proven in a court of law, and used to lock people up, it requires clear evidence. Not half-baked conjecture.
The fault with the PTI
In paragraph 31, the judgment goes into a broad and bizarrely philosophical critique of PTI as a political party — “the culture of nihilism was intentionally promoted with solipsistic approach and the workers were made to believe that they alone are laudable and all others are condemnable”. The word salad that continues for the next several lines is too long and verbose to reproduce here, but the paragraph ends with the conclusion that this political party has by virtue of its existence and beliefs, attacked all of humanity, civilisation, and “conscious human efforts, spread on centuaries, [sic] to create some practicable and effective political system”. His Lordship seems to have exercised great restraint by choosing not to declare PTI to be the real mastermind behind the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.
At this point, the question of “okay, but how is all of this relevant to a judicial order?” is so glaringly obvious that the very next paragraph seeks to address it: “Despite above discussion still the law requires sufficient proof for punishment of alleged offences and the convictions should be based on cogent and reliable evidence …”. Wonderful. On a side note, have you ever listened to a friend badmouth someone behind their back for hours on end, but they made sure to close it off with ‘but who am I to judge?’. That last line didn’t inspire a lot of confidence, did it?
 
 

Guilty by presence
Moving on to individual convictions, the judgment declares that everyone present during the allegedly conspiratorial meetings has been proved of abetment/instigation “beyond a shadow of doubt”. An Inspector adds that the presence of one gentleman, Makhdoom Zain Hussain Qureshi, could not be established at the meetings, and therefore he is acquitted.
This creates yet another bizarre legal position. Even if one were to assume that conspiracies were indeed being hatched during these meetings (for which no solid evidence has been provided), how can presence alone, in the absence of any proof of contribution to conspiracy be deemed a sufficient indicator of guilt? What if a party member attended, listened quietly, left, and went home? Does the law truly envision a 10-year prison sentence for the crime of silence? If stepping foot in the room was enough for the ATC to determine “beyond a shadow of doubt” that one is guilty of conspiracy, what about the people serving tea and biscuits at meetings like these? Should they too be locked up for a decade each?
Ultimately, through this judgment, the ATC Faisalabad has convicted 108 people and acquitted 77. The convicted maintain a right of appeal, but the Election Commission of Pakistan has been quick to disqualify all nine members of Parliament who were convicted, and their seats have been declared vacant. Vacant seats in Parliament are re-filled through by-elections. And this raises a new question — if the convictions are overturned in appeal, but a new MNA or MPA has already been elected on the vacated seat, who is to prevail?
The good news is that all of this can (and if we are to maintain any shred of hope in our justice system, should) be overturned in appeal. But much damage has already been done. This judgment is as bad at the law as it is at grammar. It makes no efforts to conceal its biases, choosing instead to flaunt them wherever it can, diving deep into explicitly political questions of who the people of Pakistan should or should not support, and doing so with an embarrassingly weak understanding of history, political theory, and the fundamental rights of free movement and association.
It is written in a style and tone that despite its inability to go two pages without a typo, assumes it knows better than you — consistently revealing a worldview that sees the people of Pakistan as easily influenced sheep, incapable of reaching their own opinions and undeserving of the freedoms inherent to a normal democracy. It treats its readers with contempt, and all but ensures that the feeling is mutual.
These are all conclusions that should matter to every Pakistani. Regardless of political beliefs or associations. Whether you like the person who was convicted or not. If a top politician can be locked up under legal reasoning that is so weak that a child could see through it, so can you. The principles at play here rise above politics and into the realm of individual liberties and the rule of law, which once chipped away, leave every single one of us more vulnerable. Yet oftentimes, developments like these are reduced to the  adversarial nature of political contention, where one side must support and the other must oppose. That is flawed.
Once you read the judgment, you realise it’s not just some politicians whose future is being attacked. It’s yours.</p><small>2025-08-11 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1112004131d5d63.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930167/govt-begins-2nd-phase-of-receiving-haj-2026-applications' target='_blank'><strong>Govt begins 2nd phase of receiving Haj 2026 applications</strong></a><br><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony has opened the second phase of receiving Haj applications for 2026, which will be accepted from August 11 to August 16, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Monday.
On Saturday, the ministry successfully completed the first phase for Haj next year, receiving more than 71,000 application submissions through its online portal and designated banks, the ministry’s spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said in a statement.
“In the second phase, which will continue till Saturday, unregistered intending pilgrims can also submit their applications. The process of receiving applications will continue through the ministry’s online portal and designated banks,” the report said.
Overseas Pakistanis can also apply for Haj through designated banks via a close relative. “Those living abroad will be required to submit their medical fitness certificates upon arrival in Pakistan,” it said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Last month, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistic measures for the pilgrimage season.
Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf said during a presser that the Kingdom allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators — pending final confirmation by Saudi authorities.
“The government scheme will offer both the traditional 38–42-day package and a shorter 20–25-day option,” the minister said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
He added that estimated costs would range between Rs1.15 to Rs1.25 million, depending on the finalised agreements with service providers.</p><small>2025-08-11 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111314551459a4f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930088/death-of-woman-fleeing-moral-policing-sparks-outrage-in-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>Death of woman fleeing ‘moral policing’ sparks outrage in AJK</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: The death of a young woman after falling from a cliff on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad on Saturday has triggered widespread outrage across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with demands for the harshest punishment for those accused of harassing couples under the guise of “moral policing” to extort money or valuables.
According to a police spokesperson, the incident occurred at about 1:15pm near Mera Tanolian village on Pir Chinasi Road, when Aqeel Ahmed and his tenant Fakhra Amjad — both residents of the Plate neighbourhood in Muzaffarabad — had stopped their Mehran car by the roadside while returning from a drive.
Three to four men, one of them a police constable in plainclothes, confronted the pair, deemed their presence “suspicious” and began beating Aqeel.
During the assault, Ms Amjad got out of the car and tried to flee, but fell approximately 100–120 feet down a mountainside into a ravine, sustaining critical head injuries.
Aqeel, also injured, tried to take her to hospital, but she died on the way. Police arrested Aqeel and Amir, son of Gul Zaman — a police constable from Mera Tanolian posted elsewhere — and were searching for the remaining suspects, the spokesperson said, adding legal proceedings had been initiated.
The incident sparked street protests and a wave of online condemnation of so-called “moral brigades” accused of harassing and blackmailing couples for extortion.
On Sunday, dozens gathered outside the press club, demanding to know under what law anyone could question people about their relationships or reasons for visiting tourist spots.
Shahid Zaman Awan, a civil society activist, said if police had done their job, there would have been no need for the protest.
“Instead of swooping on those who caused the girl’s death, they have arrested the boy who accompanied her. This is the worst example of traditional police tactics,” he said.
According to many netizens, such incidents had been occurring in this and some other areas as well for a long time, but most victims would avoid reporting them to the police or speaking out publicly.

Soldier Bazar police station SHO Waqar Azeem told Dawn that lawyer Nasir Malik, 38, had gone to meet his sister at Al-Fareed Apartment in Garden East on Business Recorder Road.
He was inside the parking area of the building when armed men opened indiscriminate fire on him and fled on motorcycles and in private cars. The lawyer sustained critical bullet wounds in the head. He was taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.

Traffic police to close Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road due to security concerns from 8am

The officer said the murder appeared to be an outcome of personal enmity as the deceased had a property dispute with someone in the area.
He said the victim’s brother had nominated four persons in the FIR under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code and efforts were underway to arrest them.
Lawyers’ announce strike today
Speaking to Dawn, president of KBA Aamir Nawaz Warraich said the KBA would stage a protest outside CM House on Monday (today) and the legal fraternity would boycott judicial proceedings.
Mr Warraich said Advocate Nasir had been brutally murdered, while the police authorities had previously assured them that lawyers would be provided protection.
“In the past 10 days, three advocates have been attacked — two of whom have died while the third one is critically injured,” he added.
 
 

He said they demand that the government immediately issue arms licences to lawyers and arrest the culprits involved in the attacks on lawyers, including senior lawyer Khawaja Shams ul Islam.
Mr Warraich reiterated that a protest would be held outside CM House on Monday and lawyers would boycott judicial proceedings.
Meanwhile, the traffic police announced that Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road will be closed from 8am due to security concerns. They announced alternative routes for traffic going towards I.I Chundrigar Road.

Pakistan, who won the opening ODI by five wickets, posted a competitive 171-7 in 37 overs in a rain-truncated match but West Indies prevailed by five wickets to draw level in the three-match series.
Pakistan’s part-time duo of Saim Ayub and Salman Agha conceded a combined 66 runs in seven wicketless overs as West Indies cruised home.
“You could say our fifth bowler gave away too many runs but in recent years, Salman Agha and Saim Ayub have both bowled well for us,” Rizwan said after the match.
“Saim didn’t have the best day today, but he performed well in the T20Is. That’s just part of the game.”
Rizwan said they could not read the conditions and several rain delays did not help their cause.
“Honestly, the weather forecast has been completely different from expectations, and it’s hard to read.
“We’re keeping our options open and will finalise the XI after assessing the conditions.”

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and said it was acting in collective self-defence of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics. Israel invoked its right to self-defence in response to Hamas’ attacks on October 7 in its military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2023. India struck Pakistan in 2025 and claimed it was acting in self-defence against an armed attack by proxies.
Finally, Israel attacked Iran in 2025 and claimed it was acting pre-emptively in self-defence against its nuclear programme. Ukraine, Pakistan, and Iran each also claimed their right to self-defence against these attacks, though of course there cannot be a right to self-defence against self-defence. So what then constitutes self-defence?
The United Nations Charter
After World War II, one of the main aims of the drafters of the United Nations Charter was to seek to restrain the use of force and avoid the horrors of that war. The first purpose of the UN listed in Article 1(1) of the Charter was to maintain international peace and security. To that end, it sought to establish a general and comprehensive prohibition on the use of force and also aimed to set up an organisation (the Security Council) that would be able to take collective action to deal with threats to the peace or breaches of the peace. It also maintained each individual state’s right to self-defence as this right is an inherent prerogative of states against aggression and is a key attribute of statehood in the international legal system.
There are three key provisions which deal with the use of force in the UN Charter:

The prohibition on the use of force in Article 2(4) to which there are two exceptions:
a.	Article 51 acknowledges the inherent rights of states to individual and collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs, and;
b.	Article 42 allows the Security Council to authorise the use of force when the Council considers that there has been a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression.

There are many controversial aspects to the law relating to self-defence. These include the right to anticipatory self-defence against an armed attack which has not yet occurred, the right to self-defence against attacks by non-state actors, the concept of humanitarian intervention, and finally, whether there is a right to self-defence in occupied territory.
Anticipatory Self-Defence
The concept of anticipatory self-defence concerns whether a state is allowed to use force to respond to an armed attack which has not yet occurred. This is usually divided into two distinct types - pre-emptive self-defence against armed attacks which are imminent or preventive self-defence against threats which have not yet materialised. While some states believe that preemptive self-defence is allowed, most believe that preventive self-defence is unlawful. The most quoted example for pre-emptive self-defence is Israel’s strike on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. Israel argued in its report to the Security Council at the time that the reactor was designed to produce atomic bombs, the target for which would have been Israel, and therefore it was exercising its inherent right of self-defence. However, UN Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) condemned Israel’s attack as inconsistent with the UN charter and recognised the right of States to develop their economy and industry for peaceful purposes.
Israel’s strike against Iran’s nuclear programme in 2025 rests on largely the same argument, that Iran may acquire nuclear weapons which it may use to target Israel in the future. Israel is unable to fulfil the imminent criteria in arguing that this could plausibly be a case of pre-emptive self-defence, as it cannot argue that Iran was about to attack Israel with nuclear weapons it does not have. While this argument may have gained currency with more states than their attack in 1981, by and large most states have viewed this as unlawful and an act of aggression. Russia similarly used this argument against Ukraine in claiming collective self-defence against attacks which may occur against Russia at some future point. According to most of the international community, these claims do not fulfil the criteria for self-defence as defined in the UN Charter.
Attacks by Non-State Actors
Jurisprudence by the International Court of Justice also holds that while states are not allowed to use force against each other (except for in self-defence or under Security Council authorisation), they also cannot use this force indirectly through proxies. In the Nicaragua judgment, the Court ruled that the provision of weapons and logistical support to a non-state armed group would amount to a use of force. Moreover, organising and sending the armed group to conduct an armed attack against another state would give the victim state the right to use force in self-defence against the state sending the armed group under Article 51. International law does not allow for a state to use force against another state through the use of proxies. However, the test for attribution is high, it requires ‘sending’ or ‘substantial involvement’ in an armed group does not include mere funding, arming, or giving military logistical support.
However, a question faced by many states is this; what if non-state actors conduct attacks on a state’s territory from the territory of another state without that state having sent them or even been involved with them in any way? The most used example for this is ISIS in Syria in 2014 as ISIS was conducting attacks against other states from Syria’s territory but instead of Syria sending or organising them or even harbouring them, Syria was actively involved in fighting against ISIS. In order to respond to this, states such as the US have created a very controversial doctrine called ‘unable or unwilling’ which provides that if a state is unable or unwilling to deal with a threat by a non-state actor, victim states of the group’s armed attacks can use force in that state’s territory against the non-state actor. While there is some state practice to support this, it remains a controversial doctrine which has not yet attained legal status. The test for targeting a non-state actor in another state’s territory remains that of ‘sending or organising’ as held in Nicaragua. As a result, India’s use of force against Pakistan in 2025 is an unlawful act of aggression, as it had no evidence to indicate that the armed attack in Pulwama was by an armed group sent or organised by Pakistan.
Humanitarian Intervention
This is a very controversial doctrine which arguably allows States to use force beyond the two exceptions in the UN Charter (self-defence or Security Council authorisation). Some States contend that, when the Security Council is paralysed, they recover a broad right to self-help and can use force if there is a major human rights threat in order to protect large numbers of civilians. They further argue that this is not a violation of Article 2(4) as it is consistent with the purposes of the UN which exists to promote human rights and protect succeeding generations from the scourge of war. This has been invoked by NATO in its military intervention in Kosovo in the 1990s. However, it has not gained acceptance among most states in the world and therefore, the use of force for humanitarian intervention remains illegal. However, it can be argued that any claim in favour of this exception is dead as no state is currently arguing for it in Gaza, and there could be no better case.
Right to Self-Defence in Occupied Territory?
Israel has invoked its right to self-defence against Hamas’ attacks on October 7. However, it is not clear whether a state has this right in territory that it occupies. The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory Opinion notes that Israel is an occupying power in Palestinian territory and therefore the right to self-defence cannot be exercised where the threat originates from within that territory. While Israel can use force to deal with threats against it, that would not be the right to self-defence as found under the UN Charter.
Future of the Law Against War
The right to self-defence remains controversial with some states advocating for narrow exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force and others arguing for very wide ones. These broad exceptions would allow the right to anticipatory self-defence against imminent armed attacks and the right to use force against states unable or unwilling to act against non-state actors operating on their territory. State practice will decide whether the law against war can retain its integrity with states attempting to carve out these large exceptions.

•  Federal committee, including GB leadership, meets today to discuss resolution
GILGIT: The ongoing sit-in on Karakoram Highway (KKH) has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass for the 22nd consecutive day on Sunday as deadlock between government and protesters persisted.
The federal committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet on Monday (today) to make recommendations for resolving the issue. GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza, PPP President Amjad Hussain Advocate, former GB chief minister and PML-N President Hafeezur Rehman have also been included in the committee.
Trade and travel between Pakistan and China, as well as business activities at the Sost Dry Port, have remained shut for the past 22 days.
The protest sit-in, called by the Tajir Ittehad Action Committee — backed by trade organisations, government and opposition parties, and religious groups in the region — is being staged at Sost, blocking trade activities between Pakistan and China in support of their demands.
Members of a committee formed by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan to resolve the matter had met the protest organisers on Friday. They discussed the issues and prepared recommendations to present to the Prime Minister’s committee.
The protesters have given a two-point agenda to the committee. They demanded exemption of GB residents from income tax, sales tax, and other federal taxes on items imported from China through the Khunjerab Pass.  They also demanded Customs clearance of 280 consignments stuck at Sost Dry Port for over a year under a one-time amnesty scheme.
The protesters announced that they would not call off their protest until their demands are implemented.
Addressing the protest, Rehan Shah, PML-N Hunza president, said that the people of GB have long been demanding their constitutional and legal rights. He added that political, religious, and trade organisations — along with both government and opposition members in GB — support these demands.
He stated that GB has been deprived of constitutional and legal rights for the past seven decades.
Zahoor Karim, PPP local president, said the federal government should only collect taxes after giving GB representation in Pakistan’s National Assembly and Senate. He stressed that the “economic murder” of GB residents would not be tolerated.
“The FBR has introduced policies to deprive GB people of their economic resources. Trade between Pakistan and China has been closed for a year, and goods worth billions of rupees are stuck at Sost Port — some damaged by rain and others expired,” he said.
Protesters said that the majority of GB residents depend on cross-border trade between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.

Both sides had held multiple rounds of talks earlier this year, but the dialogue did not move forward due to a stalemate on PTI’s demands, including the formation of a commission for the May 9 violence.
Speaking on a private TV show, the Senator said in democracies, the opposition uses constitutional and democratic ways, not violent protest. He termed the PTI’s plan to organise a protest on August 14 as the continuation of the May 9 mentality. “The government is not worried about the PTI protest call as the public had already rejected the party and showed no support to the PTI’s protest call on Aug 5,” he added.
He lashed out at incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for what he called ‘deviating from parliamentary and democratic norms’. He claimed the PTI was following its ‘undemocratic practices’ by boycotting the upcoming by-elections. He said that the PTI was already facing cracks in its ranks due to internal rifts and divisions.
He added all state institutions were functioning normally, saying the PTI was trying to paint a bleak picture of the government affairs.

In an interview to The Wire, Yashwant Shinde alleged the plot was a calculated bid to inflame communal violence and kill thousands, only for the sake of political power.
“This was a conspiracy by some people in the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP with extremely vile and perverse mindsets, solely for the sake of power,” Mr Shinde said. “They wanted to set the country on fire so that power would always remain with them.”
“Politically in coma, they exp­loited Ayodhya for 82-84 seats in 1989, their eyes lit up and then Kashmir to repeatedly boost Atal Bihari Vajpayee to prime minister,” he said.

Says Hindu-Muslims riots, attacks in Pakistan, and Kashmir were part of a plan to gain political power

Mr Shinde accused RSS leader Indresh Kumar of spearheading the plan, introducing him around 2000 to a group from Nanded and that group also underwent weapons training from the army, and there were plans to send them to Pakistan to attack civilians.
He claimed this group was training to build time bombs, with inst­ructions to target public gatherings like Muslim weddings and they went and committed these acts.
Mr Shinde recalled a bomb they were preparing accidentally exploded in Nanded in 2006, killing an RSS member. He alleged that those involved in the conspiracy included Rakesh Dhawde and Ravi Dev. Mr Shinde claimed operatives such as Pragya and Purohit were “pawns” who could be sacrificed to protect the real masterminds.
Mr Shinde, who joined the RSS in 1994, claimed he tried to derail the conspiracy from within but could not oppose it openly for fear of being killed.
After the Supreme Court dismis­sed his petition seeking a new investigation, he decided to speak publicly.
