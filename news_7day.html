On Wednesday evening, a major rescue operation was launched after a section of the emerald mine collapsed, trapping multiple workers underground. According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.
“Rescue 1122 medical teams are providing immediate medical assistance to the rescued workers,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told Dawn.com. “The operation continued for several hours after the mine collapsed, in which more than 40 personnel participated.”
The rescue operation was led by District Emergency Officer Swat Rafiullah Marwat, as per Faizi.
“The trained personnel and modern equipment of Rescue 1122 made the operation successful,” Faizi said.
Mining in Swat’s lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at serious risk.
The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.
Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has seen a boom, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju.
In November, two workers were killed after elevator in an emerald mine collapsed. The tragic incident occurred when an elevator rope snapped, causing two workers to fall to their death.</p><small>2025-08-07 06:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071023452869566.jpg?r=102352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929225/changes-to-seminary-law-may-open-new-can-of-worms' target='_blank'><strong>Changes to seminary law may open new can of worms</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Although the government managed to secure parliamentary approval for an ordinance promulgated to satisfy Maulana Fazlur Rehman and a group of seminary boards, their registration may be hampered by the fact that the law only applies to the capital territory.
During Wednesday’s proceedings, the Nat­ional Assembly passed the Societies Regis­tration (Amendment) Act 2025, allowing religious seminaries to get registered with the authority of their choice — the federal education ministry’s Directorate Gene­ral of Religious Education (DGRE), or their relevant DC office under the Societies Act 1860.
The new amendment is an addition in section 21-(C) of the law, allowing religious seminaries to choose which body they want to register themselves with. It has already been approved by the Senate.
The law became a bone of contention bet­ween the JUI-F and the ruling coalition after President Asif Ali Zardari reportedly withheld presidential assent on the bill last year.
 
 

The bill sailed through the Senate on Oct 20, 2024 and was okayed by the National Assembly the following day. At the time, the government had supported its passage in return for the JUI-F support’s on the 26th Amendment.
But the Maulana and his coterie — which included the heads of Shia, Barelvi, Deobandi, Ahle Hadith and Jamaat-i-Islami-affiliated seminary boards — were not pleased with the new requirement of having to re-register themselves.
On the other side of the spectrum were clerics led by Raghib Naeemi — the head of the country’s Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — who support registration with the education ministry.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan Ulema Council Chairman Allama Tahir Ashrafi said that since seminaries provide education, they should be under the education ministry.
“This decision has averted the conflict among the clerics and we have respected their choice, despite the fact that we have a clear majority in this sector with 10 seminary boards, and a majority of the 18,600 madressahs are under these boards,” he added.
But a legal lacuna threatens the smooth sailing of this legislation; the federal law known as the Societies Act 1860 no longer applies to provinces after it was repealed following the 18th amendment and replaced with a local law.
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza expressed concern over the government’s attitude on the matter, saying that currently, seminaries across the country were not “unregistered”, many were also facing issues such as the blocking of their bank accounts.
“The provinces repealed the Societies Act after 2019, we have had several meetings with the Balochistan government and they are waiting for approval from the federal government in this regard,” Senator Murtaza added.

Residents told Dawn on Wednesday that the Jirga-TTP talks, which had been continuing for the last six days and were meant to convince terrorists to leave the region for Afghanistan, had not only led to the postponement of the Operation Sarbakaf planned by security forces in 16 Lowi Mamund areas but also helped normalise situation in many villages to some extent.
They said the Laghari Bazar, a major commercial centre in the tehsil, reopened on Wednesday after remaining closed since July 29 due to the curfew imposed by the district administration in those areas for the launch of the Operation Sarbakaf to flush out terrorists, who were present in the region for several weeks.
 
 

Attributing normalcy to the ongoing Jirga-TTP dialogue, the residents said they were relieved to see life slowly return to normal in many areas.
“We are thrilled to see normalcy gradually return to our areas, which were plagued by uncertainty over the last week,” said Asmat Khan of Tarkho area.

Residents insist Jirga-TTP talks led to postponement of Operation Sarbakaf

He said the credit for normalcy largely went to members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga.
Ihsan Khan, a trader in Laghari Bazaar, told Dawn that almost all shops in the bazaar remained open on Wednesday.
“The entire population, especially Laghari Bazaar traders, were overjoyed to see things returning to normal after a week of unrest,” he said.
The residents said public transport vehicles had also resumed plying many areas, especially on the Inayat Kallay-Laghari Road, a main artery of Lowi Mamund tehsil that connected the area with rest of the district.
They hoped that the situation would further improve after the Jirga-TTP talks yielded results.
 
 

Meanwhile, around 800 families from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil had so far been displaced from their native villages to safer areas due to the uncertain situation.
According to residents and non-governmental organisations, those families, mostly from Tharkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanato and Zagai, have left their homes on July 30, a day after the security forces launched Operation Sarbakaf against terrorists in the region.
They claimed that almost the entire population in the affected areas had been displaced.
Reports suggest that most displaced people have moved to different areas of Khar tehsil, including Khar town, Sadiqabad town, Inayat Kallay, Umary, Tang Khata, Loe Sam, Yousafabad and Khazana. Many of them have been accommodated in guesthouses by landlords, tribal elders and well-off individuals free of charge.
Moreover, humanitarian organisations Al-Khidmat Foundation, Pakistan Red Crescent Society and JUI-F have established relief camps where displaced people get food and essential commodities.

The report attributes the recent downturn in bilateral ties to India’s increasingly restrictive trade policies, including quality control regulations, which it says have complicated trade relations and frustrated US exporters.
In contrast, a separate analysis by the BBC highlights the Trump administration’s renewed efforts to improve relations with Pakistan as another factor straining India-US ties.
The report notes that New Delhi views this shift with suspicion, given the region’s complex geopolitical dynamics.
Adding to the tensions, a separate report by the Stimson Centre in Washington points to India’s growing leadership role within the BRICS alliance as a source of irritation for the US administration. It recalls that President Trump has long been antagonistic toward BRICS members, and, in November 2024, even threatened to impose 100pc tariffs on the group’s members.
 
 

In response, both Brazil’s President Lula and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly condemned the threat, describing it as inappropriate and disrespectful to the sovereignty of independent nations.
“Today, he (Trump) followed through on his threats by hiking India’s tariff rate to 50 percent. These measures and the rhetoric … risk reversing decades of progress in the ‘partnership of the twenty-first century,’” says the Atlantic Council report.
While noting that New Delhi and Washington are still working on a trade deal “that could help restore a measure of calm,” the report adds that the Indian government is examining additional tariff concessions. India is also likely to put US LNG, defence, and “other purchase offers on the negotiating table” to make the deal more attractive.
 
 

Identifying a key stumbling block, the report notes that President Trump views New Delhi’s quality control orders (QCOs) as “strenuous and obnoxious.”
Speculating on possible Indian efforts to reduce tensions, the report adds: “India could decide that imports that are ‘Made in USA’ … are exempt from QCO requirements.”
The Stimson Centre’s analysis notes that Washington’s narrative about BRICS frames the group as vulnerable to collapse, “owing to the diversity of its membership, lack of a practical strategy to advance reform, and concerns about an anti-U.S. and anti-Global North” agenda.
Meanwhile, the BBC report identifies “Trump repeatedly putting India and its rival Pakistan on an equal footing” as one of the main causes of current tensions. According to the BBC, another “constant irritant for Delhi is Trump’s repeated assertion that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.”
The report notes that India views its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as an internal matter and has consistently rejected third-party mediation.
Yet, the US president “has doubled down on his claim” even after Modi told India’s parliament that “no country had mediated in the ceasefire.”
Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman told the BBC that some of the anger in Delhi might “be Cold War-era baggage coming to the fore,” but added, “this time around it’s intensified by real-time developments as well.”

In Balochistan’s Mastung district, three security personnel, including a senior officer, were martyred and three others sustained injuries in an improvised explosive device attack in Kirdgab area of the district.
ISPR said the incident took place on Tuesday evening in the Killi Pasand Khan area when a convoy of security for­ces was targeted by terrorists linked to Fitna al Hindustan (the state’s term for banned BLA) with an IED.
“A vehicle was targeted with an IED, which was planted at the roadside and detonated with a remote control device,” a senior official of the local administration said. The injured were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta for treatment.
FC vehicle ambushed
In Karak district, a vehicle of the Federal Frontier Constabulary was ambu­shed by militants in Amankot in the jurisdiction of the Gurgari police station. Sources said terrorists from the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan had taken up position on a mountaintop and opened fire at the pick-up truck carrying FC men.
 
 

As a result, one Lance Naik, two sepoys and their civilian driver lost their lives. The slain troops were deployed at an oil and gas facility in the Gurgari area. The rescuers reached the spot soon after the attack and shifted the bodies to a hospital in Terri.
Separately, an off-duty soldier of the Frontier Corps was killed in a gun attack in the Railway Station area of the Lakki Marwat district. A police official identified the victim as a resident of Zangikhel, saying he had recently settled in the Railway Station locality. He said that the deceased had come to his hometown on leave.
The body was moved to the Government City Hospital for medico-legal formalities. “After the attack, the police started combing the area in search of the assailants,” the official said, adding that the slain FC man was laid to rest in a local graveyard with state honours.
Three killed in Peshawar
A police official and two civilians died when unidentified armed motorcyclists opened fire at them within the jurisdiction of Michni Gate police station on Tuesday night, police said.
A statement issued by the city police read that Inspector Ali Hussain, who was serving as the in-charge of the investigation cell at Mechni Gate police station, was travelling with his friends when their car came under attack.
SSP Operations Peshawar Masood Bangash said that four unknown persons, riding on two motorcycles, targeted the vehicle, adding that some 65 empty bullet shells were recovered from the spot. The motorcyclists went towards the Mathra area on the outskirts of the provincial capital following the attack, he added.
DC convoy attacked
In another incident, Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir and Additional Deputy Commissioner Zahid Younis survived an attack in the Habib Kot area of the Ladha tehsil, Upper South Waziristan. According to ADC Fazal Wadood, the assailants started indiscriminate firing at two vehicles in the official convoy, shattering their windows.
Two policemen sustained minor injuries from the broken glass and were shifted to a local hospital in Ladha.
Speaking to Dawn over the phone, DC Asmatullah Wazir said that he along with his colleagues had reached the Ladha headquarters safely. He added that the attackers managed to flee after the incident, while the police had collected evidence from the scene and launched an investigation.
Meanwhile, a soldier of the Pakistan Navy was injured in an attack near the Bachkan Ahmadzai area in Lakki Marwat district on Wednesday. Police said that the 22-year-old navy commando, was attacked by two motorcyclists when he was going to his village on a motorcycle. They said that the attackers fled the area after the incident within the limits of the Serai Gambila police station.
The victim told the police in a preliminary report that he was posted at PNS Iqbal in Karachi and had come to his village on leave over two weeks ago.
“On the day of the incident, I left Gambila Adda for Bachkan Ahmadzai and when I reached Kheera Adda near my village, two motorcyclists in masks appeared from behind and one of them tried to aim his pistol at me,” he claimed. He said that when he resisted, the armed suspect opened fire and injured him. A case was registered against the suspects.

• Law minister distances govt from convictions, asks PTI to take their objections to court
• Naveed Qamar takes exception to ‘frequent’ presidential ordinances
ISLAMABAD: The convictions and disqualification of the PTI leaders dominated the National Assembly session on Wednesday, as the opposition party protested the haste with which the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified its members, while the government distanced itself from the decision.
After their conviction by multiple anti-terrorism courts in Punjab in cases linked to the May 9 violence, over a dozen PTI national and provincial lawmakers have been de-seated in light of the court decisions.
Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking in the house, made it clear that convictions were the outcome of a lawful judicial process and asserted that the government played no role in the process.
 
 

The opposition members entered the house carrying portraits of lawmakers disqualified by the ECP and sought to speak over the issue. However, they left the hall after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq denied them permission, saying points of order were not allowed during Question Hour.
After the opposition walked out of the house, the proceedings were suspended on account of the quorum.
After the session resumed, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the house, decried the treatment meted out to the former ruling party in the lead-up to and after the 2024 polls.
He said the PTI’s seats were being “snatched” through courts and warned that such convictions and disqualifications threatened the democratic process.
 


He said this was the first time in history that key opposition leaders had been disqualified, adding that the ECP transgressed its authority by disqualifying PTI lawmakers before their convictions had attained finality.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan claimed the PTI also condemned the May 9 violence – in which military installations were also targeted — and asked how long this incident would be used to send lawmakers packing.
But Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar responded that it was the domain of the courts to pronounce verdicts. “This is a lawful process. Objections can be raised, but the forum to do so is also the court,” he remarked.
 


He cited the example of Jamshed Dasti who had been given interim relief by the Lahore High Court following his disqualification by the ECP. He said parliament was not the forum to decide the merits of ongoing prosecutions, adding that the constitutional framework required respect for judicial independence.
After proceedings were adjourned, the opposition members exited the house, raising slogans against the convictions and disqualifications. They also staged a protest outside the Parliament House building.
Tiff over ordinances
During Wednesday’s proceedings, two key lawmakers from the PPP and the PML-N — partners in the ruling coalition — got into an argument over the frequent promulgation of ordinances.
Before two recently promulgated ordinances were laid before the house for endorsement, PPP leader Syed Naveed Qamar raised objections, saying the unnecessary promulgation of ordinances undermined parliament.
 


The objection came as a surprise to some, as his own party leader President Asif Ali Zardari is the one issuing the ordinances.
Mr Qamar noted that successive governments had been abusing and misusing the constitutional provision, which allowed the promulgation of ordinances in peculiar circumstances. “This whole process is anti-democratic and against the spirit of the Constitution,” he remarked.
Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, however, defended the ordinances, saying the process was in line with the Constitution and that no ordinance had unnecessarily been promulgated.
 
 

According to the minister, the heavens will not fall by the promulgation of ordinances. He said the house and the relevant committees could suggest amendments to the ordinances.
According to Article 89 of the Constitution, the president may, except when the Senate or the National Assembly is in session, if satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action, make and promulgate an ordinance, as the circumstances may require.

The agreement was formalised during a meeting between Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and a three-member delegation from the Iraqi Embassy in Islamabad, led by Deputy Head of Mission Abdulqadir Sulyman Alhimiri.
Describing the MoU as “a new chapter” in bilateral relations, Mr Chaudhry emphasised the significance of developing maritime passenger and cargo links.

Gwadar-Umm Qasr link to promote trade, connect Pakistani pilgrims to Najaf, Karbala

“The ferry connection can leverage our shared cultural and religious bonds while unlocking new business opportunities,” he said, underscoring the potential for increased port activity and supply chain development under Pakistan’s blue economy strategy.
The ferry service is particularly expected to benefit Pakistani pilgrims travelling to Iraq for religious observances, including Arbaeen — the Chehlum of Imam Hussain. With the government recently banning land travel to Iran, which was previously used as a transit route, the new sea connection offers a viable alternative. Each year, around one million Pakistani pilgrims visit the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala during Arbaeen.
The minister informed the delegation that Pakistan is also working to set up ferry routes with Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
In the meeting, Mr Chaudhry proposed expanding bilateral trade by boosting Pakistani exports of medicines, meat and rice to Iraq, while increasing the import of Iraqi oil into Pakistan. He pointed out that Pakistan could also meet Iraq’s demand for potassium sulphate, citing an existing manufacturing facility in the Gwadar Free Zone.
Trade figures for fiscal year 2024 show that Pakistan exported goods worth $54.29 million to Iraq, while importing petroleum products worth $145.46m.
The minister further sought Iraq’s support for Pakistan’s upcoming bid in the International Maritime Organi­sation (IMO) elections. Mr Alhimiri assured Iraq’s backing in this regard.

Moved by senior counsel Farooq H. Naek on behalf of Bahria Town’s accounts and finance manager Adnan Khurshied Babar, the petition pleaded before the Supreme Court that NAB, by auctioning the properties, was acting in a discriminatory and arbitrary manner in violation of Articles 4, 10A, 23 and 24 of the Constitution.
It argued that NAB lacked the legal authority to unilaterally auction or dispose of mortgaged properties, owned by a third-party surety, without  initiating separate proceedings or obtaining adjudication from a  competent forum.
Bahria Town, it maintained, was not a party to the plea bargain.

Tarar claims FIA raids have yielded ‘incontrovertible proof’ of money laundering

The respondents named in the appeal include Islamabad’s accountability court, NAB chairman, Rawalpindi region director general of the bureau, and the official in charge of its recovery and disbursement management cell.
Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town chairman Malik Riaz who is facing three NAB references, had pledged Bahria Town properties as collateral under a plea bargain agreement signed under Section 25(b) of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999.
The agreement was approved by the accountability court in August 2020.
The attached properties include Media House Phase-I Rawalpindi, agricultural land at Mouza Mohra Noor, Bahria Town Corporate Offices I & II, Rubaish Marquee, Arena Cinema, Bahria Town International Academy, and Safari Club.
The petition argued that the IHC’s order dismissing Bahria Town’s plea was flawed, based on misreading of the record, and legally unsound.
It further stated that both the IHC and the accountability court had acted beyond their jurisdictions, thus violating Section 88 of the CrPC, which did not permit attachment of properties owned by third parties not accused or proclaimed offenders.
‘Evidence unearthed’
In a separate statement on Wednesday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed the government had found evidence that the controversial tycoon and his real estate empire had engaged in money laundering on a “grand” scale.
He said an FIA inquiry had yielded very important documents which were “incontrovertible proof of Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s corruption”.
He claimed that evidence unearthed so far revealed money laundering to the tune of Rs1.12 billion, alleging that the Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi was used as a front.

• New import tax to take effect in three weeks, threatens exports worth $87bn; textile, footwear, gems and jewellery sectors hit
• India rejects tariffs as ‘unjustified’, vows to protect national interests; Rahul Gandhi calls it ‘economic blackmail’
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock.
The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
Trump’s executive order imposing the extra tariff did not mention China, which also imports Russian oil. A White House official had no immediate comment on whether an additional order covering those purchases would be forthcoming.
Analysts said Mr Trump’s move marks the most serious downturn in US-India relations since his return to office in January. The tariffs threaten to disrupt India’s access to its largest export market, where shipments totalled nearly $87 billion in 2024, hitting sectors like textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery.
It also marks a shift from the warm ties seen during Mr Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s February meeting, they said, pointing out Mr Trump’s recent remarks calling India’s economy “dead”, its trade barriers “obnoxious” and accusing the country of profiting from cheap Russian oil while ignoring the killings of Ukrainians in Russia’s three-and-a-half-year-old invasion of its neighbour.
India’s foreign ministry, usually shy of even contradicting the US, let alone challenging it, was forthright, calling the decision extremely unfortunate and noting that many other countries are also importing Russian oil in their national economic interest.
“India will take all necessary steps to protect its national interests,” it said, adding that purchases were driven by market factors and the energy needs of India’s 1.4 billion people.
 
 

Additionally, Mr Modi’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval was due in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi later in the year. Reports said he would also discuss the new US tariffs on Russian oil trade with India. The Kremlin described Mr Trump’s threats as “attempts to force countries to stop trade with India”.
The development comes as Mr Modi prepares for his first visit to China in over seven years, suggesting a potential realignment in alliances as relations with Washington fray.
Oil prices edged up about 1pc on Wednesday after falling to a five-week low in the prior session after Mr Trump penalised India for buying Russian oil and in light of a larger-than-expected US crude storage draw last week.
Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned China that continued Russian oil purchases could trigger new tariffs, as Washington prepares for the expiry of a US-China tariff ceasefire on Aug 12.
Blow to Indian exports
Trade between the United States and India — the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, respectively — is worth over $190 billion.
Exporters and trade analysts warn that the tariffs — which Trump casts as a driver to reduce US trade deficits and reinvigorate domestic manufacturing — could severely disrupt Indian exports.
“This is a severe setback. Nearly 55pc of our shipments to the US will be affected, said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.
The increased duties place Indian exporters at a 3,035pc disadvantage versus trade rivals in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Japan.
With such obnoxious tariff rates, trade between the two nations would be practically dead, said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global.
Indian officials acknowledged pressure to return to negotiations with the Trump administration. A phased cut in Russian oil imports and diversification could be a part of the compromise.
“We still have a window,” said a senior Indian official, requesting anonymity. The fact that the new tariffs take effect in 21 days signals the White House is open to talks.
Another official said there were no immediate plans for Modi or senior leaders to travel to Washington, nor were any retaliatory measures being considered.
Instead, the government is weighing relief for exporters, including interest subsidies and loan guarantees.
A sharp drop in US-bound shipments could drag India’s GDP growth below 6pc this year, down from the central bank’s 6.5pc forecast, said Sakshi Gupta of HDFC Bank.
India’s rupee weakened in the offshore non-deliverable forwards market while stock futures fell marginally after the announcement.
‘Economic blackmail’
Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition in the Indian Lok Sabha, insisted that the 50pc tariffs on Indian goods are “economic blackmail” to bully India into an unfair trade deal.
Soon after Mr Trump announced a penalty of another 25pc on India for buying Russian oil, the former Congress president said the prime minister should not let Indian interests be overridden.
“PM Modi better not let his weakness override the interests of the Indian people,” Mr Gandhi said in a post on X.
 






The Hindu carried an analysis showing that Mr Trump’s criticism of India for its oil and arms trade with Russia, while factually correct, allegedly lacks logic.
“India and China are not the only countries that continued purchasing energy from Russia after the Ukraine war began. In fact, data shows that the European Union’s energy imports from Russia have been higher than India’s during the war,” the newspaper said.
Moreover, while India has increased its oil imports from Russia in recent years, many EU countries — particularly the Netherlands — have been importing large volumes of petroleum products from India.
 
 

Further, the US continues to import a variety of goods, especially fertilisers, from Russia.
“Singling out a few countries for directly buying oil, while not putting the others who benefit indirectly in the same pedestal, defies logic,” the analysis said.

The House, through a resolution adopted unanimously, noted that such acts constitute a serious violation of personal privacy, undermine the dignity and integrity of individuals, and are increasingly used for harassment, blackmail, defamation, and extortion, creating a climate of fear and public insecurity, especially for women.
The resolution was moved in the House by PML-N lawmaker Syeda Nousheen Iftikhar after a motion seeking suspension of rules was carried.
 






The resolution pointed out that the Constitution guarantees the fundamental rights of all citizens, including the right to dignity and privacy (Article 14), and the right to life and liberty (Article 9), alongsi­de protections from defamation and harassment under existing laws.

Passes resolution condemning rising incidents of honour killings in the country

It said the unauthorised capturing and dissemination of images and videos of individuals particularly women have become alarmingly prevalent due to the rise of mobile devices, misuse of social media, and weak enforcement of existing laws.
It said that laws such as Peca and various provincial statutes on harassment and defamation exist, but enforcement remains insufficient and public awareness low.
It said victims particularly women often face re-victimisation due to delayed legal action, ineffective investigations, social stigma, and institutional insensitivity. The House declared that such acts were a violation of the fundamental rights and contrary to the values of an Islamic and civilised society.
It reaffirmed that the rights to dignity and privacy, as enshrined in Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution, were inviolable, and any infringement must be treated as a serious constitutional violation. It urged the federal government to streng­then the legal framework through amendments to Peca 2016, the Pakistan Penal Code, and related laws, if necessary.
It also sought to enhance capacity of law- enforcement agencies, including digital forensics units, to investigate and respond promptly and effectively.
The House urged the federal government to coordinate with provincial governments to ensure uniform enforcement of laws across all provinces.
It also called for introducing education modules in schools, colleges and universities covering digital ethics, privacy rights, and anti-harassment laws. The House demanded that the government ensure strict accountability of offenders and proceed against them under applicable laws.
Honour killings condemned
The House also passed a resolution condemning the rising incidents of so-called honour killings across the country and calling for action to prevent such violence.
The resolution, moved in the House by Shahida Rehnani, MNA, on behalf of the Women’s Parliam­entary Caucus (WPC), demanded a zero-tolerance approach towards perpetrators of honour-based violence and called for establishing a national database to document and monitor cases of honour killings.
It also urged relevant authorities to strengthen protection mechanisms for individuals at risk, including confidential helplines, safe shelters, and legal aid for women and girls threatened with violence.
It also proposed forming an inter-provincial task force comprising representatives from all provincial women’s parliamentary caucuses to coordinate efforts against honour killings and monitor provincial compliance with national laws.
The House, through another unanimously-adopted resolution, expressed deep concern over the continuing and escalating Israeli military aggression in Gaza saying this has resulted in the killing of civilians and widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure.
Moved in the House by Shazia Marri, the resolution strongly condemned the recent statements and actions by Israeli authorities indicating plans for long-term occupation of Gaza, forced displacement of its population and efforts to erase the Palestinian identity of the territory.

A crackdown on dollar smuggling launched on July 23 has led to a minor depreciation of around Rs3 in both the open and interbank markets. However, this has done little to bridge the gap between market sentiment and official expectations. The dollar continues to trade above Rs280, and a noticeable shortage has emerged.
In recent meetings held in Islamabad with banks, currency dealers, and jewellers, authorities reportedly reiterated their desire to bring the dollar down to Rs250. However, participants in the meetings described the target as unrealistic. Some bankers estimate the real market parity to be closer to Rs281.
Currency dealers say major foreign currencies — including the US dollar, British pound, and euro — are largely unavailable. “You might find a few hundred dollars at some counters, but most dealers are facing acute shortages,” said a senior dealer from an ‘A’ category exchange company.

Market pushback thwarts govt’s bid to bring greenback down to Rs250

While Malik Bostan, President of the Forex Association of Pakistan, recently dismissed reports of a currency shortage and claimed readiness to meet demand, most dealers disagree. Many suspect that an illegal parallel market has resurfaced, where the dollar is selling at higher rates than those quoted by the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
On Wednesday, ECAP quoted the dollar at Rs285.15 in the open market and Rs282.87 in the interbank.
“There is no real shortage — the resistance to price controls is fuelling the perception of one,” said a senior interbank market analyst.
Atif Ahmed, a dealer operating in the interbank market, explained that banks with State Bank approval to sell dollars to importers are prioritising their own clients and setting higher rates acceptable to buyers. “Opening a letter of credit (LC) for $0.5 million has become a tough task for importers,” he added.
 
 

Although imports in FY25 have increased, indicating a relatively easier import regime than last year, analysts believe the current forex dynamics will make it difficult to achieve the Rs250 target. While the rupee may briefly strengthen into the 270s, sustained appreciation appears unlikely.
“The economy does not support a stronger rupee at this stage,” said a senior banker. “We remain dependent on the US dollar’s performance in global markets — and even though it has weakened slightly in 2025, that won’t be enough to pull the rupee to Rs250.”

Sources said this would be a return visit, following a trip to Pakistan by Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), in late July.
In a press statement issued on Aug 4, CENTCOM recalled Gen Kurilla’s recent visit to Pakistan and other countries in the region.
During the visit, Gen Kurilla was also conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Milit­ary) by the Pakistani government.
Field Marshal Munir previously visited Washin­gton in June, when he was hosted by President Don­ald Trump for lunch at the White House — an unprecedented gesture typically reserved for visiting heads of state or government.
There was no official word on the visit from Inter- Services Public Relations or Pakistan’s embassy in Washington, but during his previous, the army chief had hinted that he expected to return to the US again later in the year.
The development comes just over a month after the US general described Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in counterterrorism efforts during a congressional hearing, where he also praised Pakistan’s role “in promoting peace and stability” in the region.
No designs on Presidency
Separately, the ISPR chief has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president, Dawn.com reported.
His statement follows a similar rebuttal by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told The Econo­mist in a recent interview that talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’.

Pakistan’s emerging importance after the May skirmishes with India, President Donald Trump’s soft pronouncements coupled with a warm welcome to the top leadership, the souring of US-India ties, a reasonably good deal on reciprocal tariffs, the upgrading of credit ratings, prospective investment in ‘massive’ oil reserves and minerals, etc, have led to euphoria.
However, this exuberance should be tempered by the experience of past relationships with major powers, which have been transactional and not permanent. High-wire acts carry risks. We should not allow the feel-good factor to intoxicate us. Our policymakers should not project life as being easy going forward, as if they were no longer obligated to carry out the onerous task of building a strong economy through stabilisation and deep reform. In short, there is no room for complacency as we are far from overcoming our domestic vulnerabilities, which are accentuated by adverse external conditions.
De-globalisation, inward-looking industrial policies, onshoring and nearshoring of supply chains, disruptive and exorbitant tariffs hindering international trade and openness, the likely slowing down of the US economy, climate change risks and AI penetration have made it difficult for emerging economies to repeat the exceptional progress made in 1990-2015. Domestically, the drivers of competitiveness — industrial and agricultural productivity through diffused innovation, a less skilled workforce, dysfunctional governance institutions, political instability, an inequitable and distortive taxation structure, overregulation, the deep intrusion of state agencies in the market, an outdated model of energy pricing and the SOEs’ continuing losses — are stumbling blocks to generating jobs, expanding exports, reducing poverty and attracting investment.
Digitisation, financial inclusion and the absorption of emerging technologies are still in their infancy and yet to permeate transaction structures. The debt burden has not yet reverted to the legal benchmark of 60 per cent of GDP, and the rollover risk of short-term deposits by friendly countries remains high. Foreign exchange reser­ves are inadequate for the growing needs of a buo­yant economy and as a buffer for unanticipated future shocks. Continuity and consistency of economic policies are yet to be tested when faced with politically unpopular decisions that end the privileges of rent-seeking classes, including those defying formalisation and documentation.

We should not allow the feel-good factor to intoxicate us.

Many reforms resulting in stabilisation, deregulation of wheat prices and non-essential drugs, the Pakistan Single Window, automation and data integration of FBR taxes with third-party databases, the phasing out of regulatory and additional duties and reduction in rates and slabs, right-sizing of the federal government, privatisation of PIA and the Discos, civil service reform, and introducing a competitive market for the energy sector have been initiated. They should be brought to a successful culmination. Other planned reforms such as targeted subsidies and training of women through BISP, the repair of provincial finances by raising outcome-based investment in social sectors, developing employable skills for youth, the efficient use of irrigation water and drought- and heat-resistant seeds, boosting industries providing intermediate inputs such as steel, petrochemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, electronics and export facilitation have yet to see the light of day.
Delivery of basic public services has suffered since directly elected, fully empowered and well-resourced local governments were dissolved. Stiff resistance by MNAs and MPAs, who fear losing their clout, has prevented the completion of devolution. There’s no realisation that dissatisfaction with the government of the day will dwindle once local communities take charge of their own affairs, and mobilise and allocate resources for what they see as priority needs in their areas. Surveys show that citizens with complaints have easier access to local councillors who can address their grievances than they do to their MPAs and MNAs. The Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad metropolitan corporations will no longer be dependent upon the provincial or federal governments, who can then allocate more resources to backward districts.
Underpinning the agenda of socioeconomic revival is an improved internal security situation. Continuous instability in Balochistan and KP’s merged districts has kept foreign and domestic investors from exploring our mineral resources. The Chinese, who helped us with the CPEC projects, are now reluctant to come to Pakistan for fear for their lives and property. America’s recent interest in these sectors can only be actualised if the security situation improves. That requires local communities to have a say in and control of the projects designed to benefit them in the form of jobs, contracts, services, roads, internet connectivity, skills training, support to SMEs or other economic activities suited to their endowments.
The present approach, whereby the provincial and federal governments maximise their returns at the expense of neglecting local communities, must be reversed. The security situation is likely to improve over time as trust and credibility are established, and genuine representatives, rather than handpicked electables, are elected to the assemblies. Over time, youth unemployment would recede; literacy, enrolment levels and social indicators, and infrastructure would catch up with those in the developed districts, and the temptation to join or implicitly support militants would be suppressed.
Pakistan’s favourable geostrategic position would be strengthened if we don’t have to rush to the IMF and friendly countries for bailouts each time a crisis erupts or to adopt stringent administrative measures to restrict imports of raw material, machinery and components, thus hurting sustained growth. We have to walk a tightrope around foreign policy by not alienating our long-term friend China while maintaining healthy ties with the US — our major trading partner. It is heartening that we are moving in that direction, but this has to be sustained. We have to put in our best effort to improve relations with our neighbouring countries, including India. A prosperous South Asia would be a precursor of regional peace and the welfare of the two billion people living in the region.
In sum, Pakistan is fortunate to have a confluence of favourable circumstances, but this should not lull us into complacency, which deviates from the path of inclusive and sustained growth. We have to consolidate the reforms initiated, undertake planned ones and reorient our foreign policy.

Few could have imagined that the controversial real estate developer would one day be humbled thus. It was, after all, considered untouchable for a large part of its history.
Yet on Tuesday, as its chairman issued a lengthy statement beseeching the state for “serious dialogue and a dignified solution”, it seemed that Bahria Town might finally be feeling the heat. “[…] We assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent. […] If the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing,” the statement read. It was prefaced with a long account of Bahria Town’s ‘contributions’ to Pakistan, as well as a lament on the dire straits the company now finds itself in.
One wonders if the many citizens dispossessed by Bahria Town’s aggressively expansionist real estate projects have felt schadenfreude over its predicament. As part of several investigations into the developer’s activities, this publication came across scores of accounts of citizens who had been rendered helpless by Bahria Town’s immense clout and heft. Even the Supreme Court had struggled, during its examination of the developer’s BTK project, to account for the impunity it enjoyed during its expansion, which was aided by unprecedented levels of government corruption and state connivance.
But though the settlement Bahria Town eventually agreed with the apex court to atone for its misdoings had seemed relatively modest at the time, it seems it continued to haunt it. For some reason, Bahria Town never made good on its commitments and began defaulting very early on against scheduled payments. Why this did not invite the court’s scrutiny sooner has never truly been explained.
The state now wants Bahria Town to pay, and is willing to exercise all options at its disposal. The Bahria Town chairman suggested in the past that the developer was being targeted due to his refusal to become party to the Al Qadir Trust case against former prime minister Imran Khan. That case revolved around assets worth £190m seized from Malik Riaz by the UK government and repatriated to Pakistan, which the present government believes were misappropriated to ‘benefit’ Bahria Town by adjusting them against its dues to the Supreme Court. The authorities are now even seizing Bahria Town properties tied to other cases.
But if the present regime at some point offers some ‘benefit’ to Bahria Town in return for Mr Riaz’s ‘cooperation’, it would be considered guilty of the same malfeasance it accuses Mr Khan of. Justice demands that Bahria Town be prosecuted fairly and fully by the authorities — independent of all other considerations.

• China evacuates over 75,000 from southern parts as heavy rain causes landslides, flooding
NEW DELHI/BEIJING: Deadly floods fuelled by torrential monsoon rains have devastated parts of India and China, killing several people and leaving dozens missing or trapped as rescue teams in both nations raced to find survivors, officials said on Wednesday.
In the Indian Himalayas, the army deployed sniffer dogs, drones and heavy earth-moving equipment to search for scores of people missing a day after flash floods ravaged a mountain valley.
At least four people were killed and more than 50 are unaccounted for after a wall of muddy water and debris smashed into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state, rescue officials said.
The Indian army said that rescue efforts were being hastened.
“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc., have been moved … to hasten the efforts,” the army said.
Torrential monsoon rains have hampered the rescue, with communication limited and phone lines damaged.
However, the number of missing was reduced from around 100 late Tuesday as soldiers reached marooned individuals.
“The search for the missing is ongoing,” said Mohsen Shahedi from the National Disaster Response Force.
Mr Shahedi said more than 50 people were missing from Dharali, while 11 soldiers were unaccounted for from the nearby village of Harsil.
Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-story apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.
Suman Semwal told the Indian Express his father saw the flood hitting Dharali with a “rumbling noise” from a village uphill.
“They tried to scream, but could not make themselves heard,” Semwal said.
“The people couldn’t comprehend what was happening. The flood waters struck them in 15 seconds.”
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain and that rescue teams were deployed “on a war footing.”
A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with officials estimating it was 50 feet deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.
Climate change experts warned the disaster was a “wake-up call”.
Hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimeters (10 inches) of rain that fell within 24 hours was an “extreme event”.
“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common and could be linked to climate change,” said Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.
Harjeet Singh, a climate activist from the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation in New Delhi, said the problem was exacerbated by “unscientific, unsustainable, and reckless construction” in the name of development.
“Global warming is super-charging our monsoons with extreme rain,” Singh said. “The devastating loss … must be our final wake-up call.”
China evacuates thousands
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated as heavy rains batter southern China, flooding homes and triggering landslides, state media said on Wednesday.
In southern Guangdong province, a landslide in its capital, Guangzhou, trapped 14 people.
One person was later confirmed dead, state broadcaster CCTV said.
More than 75,000 people in Guangdong had been evacuated by noon on Wednesday, according to CCTV Footage showed people wading in waist-deep water and clinging to a submerged car.
 
 

Of the 14 people trapped by the landslide that hit Guangzhou’s Dayuan village around 8:30am seven had been rescued and were “not in immediate danger,” CCTV reported.
The body of an eighth person was recovered later in the evening, and rescue efforts for the remaining missing were continuing.
Authorities activated an emergency response in Guangdong due to severe flooding.
The central government is also allocating 100 million yuan for the recovery effort, stating that continuous rainfall had caused “heavy casualties and property losses.”
Heavy rains in northern Beijing killed 44 people last month, with the capital’s rural suburbs hit the hardest.
A landslide in a village in Hebei province, which encircles Beijing, killed another eight people.
Natural disasters are common across China, particularly in the summer when some regions experience heavy rain while others bake in searing heat.

• 20 killed as truck overturns on a crowd of aid seekers
GAZA: Weakened by hunger, many Gazans trek across a ruined landscape each day to haul all their drinking and washing water — a painful load that is still far below the levels needed to keep people healthy.
Even as global attention has turned to starvation in Gaza, where after 22 months of a devastating Israeli military campaign a global hunger monitor says a famine scenario is unfolding, the water crisis is just as severe according to aid groups.
Though some water comes from small desalination units run by aid agencies, most is drawn from wells in a brackish aquifer that has been further polluted by sewage and chemicals seeping through the rubble, spreading diarrhoea and hepatitis.
Most water and sanitation infrast­ructure has been destroyed and pumps from the aquifer often rely on electricity from small generators — for which fuel is rarely available.
Moaz Mukhaimar, aged 23 and a university student before the war, said he has to walk about a kilometre, queuing for two hours, to fetch water. He often goes three times a day, dragging it back to the family tent over bumpy ground on a small metal handcart.
“How long will we have to stay like this?” he asked, pulling two larger canisters of very brackish water to use for cleaning and two smaller ones of cleaner water to drink.
His mother, Umm Moaz, 53, said the water he collects is needed for the extended family of 20 people living in their small group of tents in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. “The children keep coming and going and it is hot. They keep wanting to drink. Who knows if tomorrow we will be able to fill up again,” she said.
Their struggle for water is replicated across the tiny, crowded territory where nearly everybody is living in temporary shelters or tents without sewage or hygiene facilities and not enough water to drink, cook and wash as disease spreads.
Queues for water
“Water scarcity is definitely increasing very much each day and people are basically rationing between either they want to use water for drinking or they want to use a lot for hygiene,” said Danish Malik, a global water and sanitation official for the Norwegian Refugee Council.
Merely queuing for water and carrying it now accounts for hours each day for many Gazans, often involving jostling with others for a place in the queue. Scuffles have sometimes broken out, Gazans say.
Collecting water is often the job of children as their parents seek out food or other necessities.
 
 

“The children have lost their childhood and become carriers of plastic containers, running behind water vehicles or going far into remote areas to fill them for their families,” said Munther Salem, water reso­urces head at the Gaza Water and Environment Quality Authority.
With water so hard to get, many people living near the beach wash in the sea.
New pipeline
A new water pipeline funded by the United Arab Emirates is planned, to serve 600,000 people in southern Gaza from a desalination plant in Egypt. But it could take several more weeks to be connected.
Much more is needed, aid agencies say. Unicef spokesperson James Elder said the long-term deprivations were becoming deadly. “Starvation and dehydration are no longer side effects of this conflict. They are very much frontline effects.”
20 aid seekers killed
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Wednesday that 20 people were killed when an aid truck overturned on a crowd of aid seekers in the central Gaza Strip.
 
 

“Twenty people were killed and dozens injured around midnight last night in a truck carrying aid overturned… while hundreds of civilians were waiting for aid,” the agency’s spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
The incident took place near the Nuseirat refugee camp, as the truck was driving on an unsafe road that Israel had previously bombed, Bassal added.
Hamas accused Israel of forcing truck drivers to take dangerous routes to reach aid distribution centres, and to “intentionally engineer… starvation and chaos.”
Israel “forces drivers to navigate routes overcrowded with starving civilians who have been waiting for weeks for the most basic necessities,” Hamas’s media office said in a statement. “This often results in desperate crowds swarming the trucks,” it added.

Wednesday’s sitting, the third in this series since August 2, featured representatives from North Waziristan, Upper and Lower South Waziristan, as well as the tribal subdivisions of Wazir, Bettani, Darazinda, and Jandola.
They demanded talks with both, banned outfits in Pakistan and the Afghan interim government, to secure peace in the region.
The sessions are being held in the wake of the July 24 multiparty conference, which had recommended that jirgas, comprising elders,  parliamentarians and stakeholders from every district, be convened before holding a grand jirga some 15 days later to devise a strategy for the implementation of decisions. For the grand jirga, members would be nominated by the first jirga.

Tribal representatives from Waziristan, other areas say military offensive can’t ensure regional peace

The first regional jirga with tribal elders, religious scholars and representatives from Peshawar, Orakzai, Darra Adam Khel and subdivision Hassan Khel had recommended that the federal government arrange a delegation, comprising representatives of the provincial government and tribal elders, to hold a dialogue with Afghanistan and provide necessary support and resources to facilitate this process.
The second jirga, which was organised on Aug 4 with representatives from Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts, opposed military operations or forced displacement, while seeking a broad-based and empowered jirga, with members from federal and provincial governments, tribal elders and all key stakeholders, to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Afghan people and interim government to root out terrorism in the region.
On Wednesday, too, the jirga stressed talks, not military offensives, could bring peace in the region, seeking talks with both the banned outfits in Pakistan and the interim Afghan government.
“Negotiations are the only way out and this is evident from the recent past when Americans and their allies, after fighting against Afghan Taliban for over 20 years, held talks,” sources privy to the meeting told Dawn.
“The state has been at war against militants for almost 22 years with several military operations already carried out against militants, but the situation has yet to improve,” sources quoted participants of the meeting as saying.
 
 

They, however, were surprised with the provincial government’s approach towards the issue, objecting that the meeting held for devising future course of action for peace in the region did not give any security briefing to the participants. Some participants also objected to what they called the policy of ‘Good and Bad Taliban’.
“We do not accept this policy. We do not want any of them and the state has to chain the Good Taliban,” the sources quoted the participants as saying.
 
 

Another participant in the meeting quoted the KP chief minister as saying the provincial government wanted public support to forward the case to the ‘power-that-be’ and termed people his strength.
When contacted, KP government’s spokesperson Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said this [engaging Afghan interim government for peace in the region] was the provincial government’s stance and then people of the province, too, demanded engagement with the interim Afghan government.
“The federal government is not serious in peace in this region which is why it has yet to reply to the TORs prepared by the provincial government in February, for negotiations with the interim Afghan government,” Mr Saif told Dawn.
He was of the opinion that the process of “negotiations with Afghanistan’s interim government would have begun earlier, had this [militancy] been happening anywhere else in the country”.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan, one of the countries least prepared to deal with the impact of climate change, was hit particularly hard this year as it received 15 per cent more rainfall than average.
This anomaly was a result of human actions that exacerbated the crisis of climate change, said a group of 18 scientists and researchers who were part of the World Weather Attribution group at Imperial College’s Grantham Institute in the UK.
The group, which included experts from universities and meteorological agencies in Pakistan, the UK, France and the Netherlands, said the recent floods were triggered by heavier-than-normal rainfall and blamed human actions for the weather anomaly.
Pakistan’s monsoon season starts in late June and ends in September. It brings 70 to 80pc of the country’s annual rainfall, but frequently causes flooding.
While monsoon rains are crucial for replenishing water sources, they have become more intense recently.
“Pakistan’s monsoon has intensified to the point that even months with moderately heavy rain are leading to high death tolls,” said Dr Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London.
She said the downpours analysed in the report were “not record-breaking” but point to a broader trend: climate change is making floods “increasingly dangerous”.
The floods, which followed relentless bouts of heavy monsoon rain, badly hit the northern half of Pakistan.
States of emergency had been declared in several districts, with floodwaters submerging roads, destroying homes and wiping out crops.
From June 26 to August 3, 300 people were killed across the country, with 242 deaths in a region of northern Pakistan, the study analysed.
 
 

Historical rainfall data showed recent downpours in northern Pakistan were not particularly extreme compared to other years.
In today’s climate, with 1.3°C of warming, similar 30-day spells of heavy monsoon rain can be expected about once every five years.
However, the rainfall would have been much less intense if humans hadn’t warmed the climate by burning fossil fuels, the report added.
“After combining weather data with climate models, the researchers found that climate change made the heavy monsoon rainfall about 15pc more intense”, the report said.
Transition from fossils
Pakistan, which is responsible for about 0.5pc of historic carbon emissions, has been ranked as the 152nd country least ready for climate impacts. This makes the impact of heatwaves, drought and floods more pronounced.
The report has called for urgent steps to strengthen flood resilience to save communities from the impact of climate-induced disasters.
It warned that “monsoon downpours will continue to intensify in Pakistan until the world transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy”.
“Every tenth of a degree of warming will lead to heavier monsoon rainfall, highlighting why a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is so urgent,” said Dr Zachariah.
 
 

The report noted that international adaptation finance was urgently nee­ded for Pakistan, which required an estimated $40 to 50 billion annually to cope with extreme weather.
Without large-scale transformative adaptation, extreme weather could cost Pakistan an estimated $1.2 trillion by 2050, according to an earlier UN report.
At COP29, rich countries, responsible for most emissions, agreed to raise climate finance for developing nations to $300 billion by 2035.
However, there remains a significant gap between the climate finance currently provided by developed countries and the amount needed, it said.
The report quoted the UN that developed countries were only providing about $28 billion in adaptation finance annually, which is $187 to $359bn short of what is required.
It said floods in 2022 killed more than 1,700 people, underscoring how vulnerable Pakistan was to climate change but three years later, monsoon floods were still resulting in shocking loss of life.
“Climate change is taken more seriously in Pakistan, but internatio­nal finance and long-term planning are lacking”, it said, adding a record-breaking 48.5°C in northern Pakistan, followed by deadly rains in July, was yet another stark reminder of what the country was enduring at just 1.3°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels.

Skipper Fatima Sana was the pick of the bowlers for the Green Shirts at the Clontarf Cricket Club Ground, getting a career-best 4-26 as the team looked to kickstart a packed international calendar — featuring two white-ball World Cups — with a winning performance after bowling the Irish side out for 142.
However, that was not meant to be, as the Irish side restricted the visitors to 131 in their chase, with all-rounder Orla Prendergast being adjudicated player of the match for her three wickets and 26 runs.
In the first innings, Sadia Iqbal, the number one ranked T20I bowler in the world, started her spell by conceding a boundary to Ireland opener Amy Hunter.
 






Skipper Fatima struck in just her second over, bowling an inswinger to dislodge her opposite number Gaby Lewis’s middle stump.
The Irish side then recovered to score 48-1 at the end of the powerplay — courtesy five boundaries from opener Hunter.
Left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu came into the attack to bowl the seventh over, conceding just five in her first over.
She got the breakthrough in her next over — removing Hunter for 37 when the Irish batter was bowled round her legs while attempting to sweep, and the ball crashed into her stumps.
At the halfway mark of the innings, the Irish side were meandering along at 70-2 before Prendergast and left-handed Leah Paul got together at the crease to try to up the momentum.
 






Their efforts were cut short though when Rameen Shamim got the next wicket for the Green Shirts when Prendergast tried to sweep her — only to top-edge the ball to a gleefully waiting Fatima at short fine leg.
The Karachi-born spinner broke the partnership just before the Irish innings got going again.
Paul was the next to fall for Ireland, top edging a shot off Sadia to be caught at long-on after scoring a brisk 28 off 19. The Pakistani skipper then returned for the 17th over to claim two more Irish wickets.
Ireland continued to lose regular wickets, with Fatima bowling Jane Maguire with a yorker in the penultimate over of the innings.
Pacer Diana Baig got her first wicket in the 20th over of the Irish innings, with the Irish team getting bowled out for 142 after losing their last two batters to runouts.
The Pakistani reply did not get off to the best of starts as they lost southpaw opener Muneeba Ali for just 5 when she hit a Prendergast delivery straight to mid-off.
Her fellow opener Gull Feroza could also not last for long at the crease — getting bowled by pacer Jane Maguire for five in the fourth over of the innings.
Veteran bat Sidra Amin — Pakistan’s leading run scorer in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers earlier this year then steadied the ship with the hard-hitting Aliya Riaz.
Both batters, who had top-scored for the Green Shirts in a victory in their previous encounter against the Irish side in the Qualifiers in Lahore, fell in quick succession to soft dismissals.
Ava Canning and Cara Murray got the wickets of Sidra and Aliya respectively in the 8th and 9th over of the innings to leave the visitors reeling at 42-4.
Debutant Eyman Fatima combined with Natalia Pervaiz at the crease to bring up Pakistan’s 50 in the 11th over of their innings.
Eyman subsequently got run out in a stroke of bad luck when Natalia hit a full toss back towards Murray, who got a hand to the ball before it crashed into the stumps.
Skipper Fatima was the next batter at the crease, getting going from the get-go by hitting a boundary off Murray — only to be given out caught behind in the next over by spinner Lara McBride.
The Pakistan captain made her disapproval of the decision well-known before exiting the field, not getting a chance to review as the decision review system was not available.

Natalia tried to up the rate with a brisk 34 partnership with Rameen before she fell to a straightforward length delivery by Prendergast.
Despite some resistance by Rameen till the penultimate over, Pakistan still fell short of the below-par target by 11 runs.
This is the fifth bilateral T20I series between the two sides. The record so far stands even, with both Pakistan and Ireland having won two series each. However, the overall head-to-head is tilted heavily in Pakistan’s favour, with the visitors winning 15 of the 19 encounters since their first meeting in Dublin in 2009 going into the match.
The series follows a productive month of preparation for Pakistan, who held a 17-day skills camp and a five-day pre-tour camp at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre in Karachi before arriving in Dublin on August 3.
Ireland, meanwhile, entered the series high on confidence after a dominant showing against Zimbabwe women last month, where they swept both the T20I and ODI series at home.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-08-06 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0622044929e44c3.jpg?r=234005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929123/body-of-missing-teenage-girl-found-from-nullah-near-punjabs-rawat' target='_blank'><strong>Body of missing teenage girl found from nullah near Punjab’s Rawat</strong></a><br><p>The body of a missing teenage girl was recovered from a drain near Punjab’s Rawat on Wednesday, according to police.
Kahuta Police Station House Officer (SHO) Zakaullah Shah told Dawn.com: “ Fifteen-year-old Sania Bibi, daughter of Muhammad Waris, a resident of Kahuta town, had gone missing from her home the previous day, while her body was found lying in Lang Nullah in the Rawat area on Wednesday morning.“
Shah said that her body was transported to Kahuta Tehsil Headquarter Hospital for a postmortem to ascertain the cause of her death.
The SHO further added that her family had told the police that she was mentally ill and had left her home barefoot.
“They were searching for her and she probably jumped into the ravine. Her body was recovered miles away in the Rawat area, at the bank of the nullah,” the SHO said.
The official added that all aspects of her death would be investigated after receiving postmortem reports.
Last month, the prime suspect in the Arshman Akhtar murder case was killed in an alleged encounter with the police.
Four-year-old Arshman Akhtar’s body was found in a pond in Rawat in November last year after going missing from a wedding.

According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.
“Upon receiving the alert, the district emergency officer immediately dispatched a specialised disaster response team to the site, where a full-scale rescue operation was launched without delay,” said Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul.
Gul confirmed that four mine rescuers entered the collapsed shaft, working to reach and retrieve the trapped individuals.
“Rescue efforts were being carried out with urgency, utilising all available resources including modern equipment, ambulances and medical teams stationed at the site,” she said, adding that additional support has been requisitioned from nearby mines and emergency units to expedite the operation.
“We are doing everything in our capacity to ensure a safe and successful rescue,” Gul said, adding that Swat District Emergency Officer Rafiullah Marwat also reached the site of the incident and would personally supervise the operation.
Eyewitnesses and local workers, however, expressed concern over the lack of scientific methods and safety measures traditionally employed in such mining operations, according to a Dawn.com correspondent at the scene.
“These emerald mines are being run in an entirely unscientific and unregulated manner,” local resident Abid Ali Jan told Dawn.com, adding that safety protocols are often neglected in pursuit of profit.
Mining in Swat’s lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at serious risk.
“We have even reported that some residents located in the same mountain, closer to the mine, carry out illegal mining and they have made the land beneath many houses shallow,” said Ihasanullah, a resident of Malook Abad near the mine. “Despite the complaints, the authorities do not take action against them.”
The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.
Rescue teams continued the operation, while anxious family members and locals gathered near the site.</p><small>2025-08-06 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06195241e9bca85.jpg?r=210728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929114/enforced-disappearances-other-issues-fuelling-public-alienation-political-instability-in-balochistan-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Enforced disappearances, other issues fuelling public alienation, political instability in Balochistan: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”. The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In a press release issued today, the HRCP said: “The mission’s findings reveal a disturbing pattern of continued enforced disappearances, shrinking civic space, erosion of provincial autonomy and unchecked impunity — conditions that continue to fuel public alienation and political instability.”
The mission observed that the state’s framing of the issue “risks normalising what international human rights law considers a crime against humanity”, it said, adding that the report called for independent investigations into alleged reprisals against those who spoke up against enforced disappearances.
While stating that terrorist attacks on ordinary citizens, including non-Baloch settlers, were “indefensible and must be prosecuted”, the HRCP called the passage of the Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act, 2025, “deeply problematic”.
“The law permits 90-day detentions without meaningful judicial oversight, raising concerns about the potential for torture and abuse,” the HRCP said, urging the government to withdraw the act and ensure compliance with human rights obligations in all counterterrorism efforts.
Citing the report, the press release said that electoral manipulation and political sidelining of nationalist parties had “severely undermined public trust in democratic processes”.
“The mission recommends that the state ensure transparency, fairness and accountability in all electoral processes by investigating credible allegations of rigging and depoliticising administrative structures to avoid further political disaffection,” it added.
It continued, “The mission has called for the demilitarisation of civilian law enforcement and for a unified civilian police force with adequate resources and training in community-based, rights-compliant policing to replace the current overreliance on paramilitary and military forces.”
 
 

The HRCP urged the state to “publicly affirm” the role of human rights defenders and guarantee their protection, stating, “The report also underscores the delegitimisation of civil society movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), observing that equating human rights advocacy with militancy only deepens alienation, especially among the youth.”
It also called on the government to reinstate constitutional protections under the 18th Amendment and respect provincial autonomy in natural resource management, while highlighting “controversial projects such as Saindak and recent amendments to the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act”.
The HRCP further said that the state must initiate a “transparent, inclusive and rights-based political solution” to prevent the political and security conditions in Balochistan from deteriorating.
“Importantly, the mission notes that the risk of ethnic reprisals beyond the province is real and growing, threatening national cohesion, and accordingly calls for principled leadership rather than further securitisation,” it added.
 






The report
The report looked at the scale and impact of media censorship and threats to journalists, “including violence, intimidation, and restrictions on news coverage”, and the consequences of internet shutdowns, university closure and other restrictions on civic life and access to information, it said.
The fact-finding mission aimed to assess the scale of “enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary detentions, particularly of activists, students and members of the BYC” and examine the alleged repression of rights-based movements and peaceful protest, including the use of anti-terrorism and preventive detention laws against non-violent activists and demonstrators, the report said.
 
 

The report termed the issue of enforced disappearances as the “most urgent and widespread human rights concern” and said that the testimonies from political leaders, civil society actors and law enforcement officials highlighted the “scale, impunity and evolving character of this practice”.
It stated, “Accounts suggest that the phenomenon, far from being isolated or exceptional, has become systematic, thereby undermining the rule of law and severely eroding public trust in state institutions.
“A key theme that emerged was the shift in the pattern of enforced disappearances from prolonged incommunicado detention to allegations of an increasingly common ‘kill-and-dump’ approach.”
Citing data provided by the police, the report said that there were 356 reported cases of enforced disappearances, 116 people were traced, 36 were removed from records due to incomplete information, 12 individuals were killed in police encounters and 192 cases remained unresolved.
In 2025, the Balochistan police registered 46 new cases of enforced disappearance, it said, adding that around 1,300 individuals among the 5,000 reported by Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal were said to have been “recovered”.
 
 

The report said that the victims’ families and friends continued to face “harassment, intimidation and denial of justice” when attempting to report such cases or raise public awareness.
“In multiple cases, family members say they were followed, subjected to surveillance, and in some instances detained or denied professional credentials,” it added.
HRCP highlighted the state’s perspective on enforced disappearances, stating that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti “acknowledged” that the issue was a concern, but “attempted to reframe the issue as a ‘complex’ and ‘contested’ one”.
“Bugti further argued that militant groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army were also responsible for abductions, although such claims could not be independently verified by the mission,” it said.
The report quoted Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail as saying, “disappearances happen when insurgencies take place”, stating that this framed them “as a byproduct of conflict rather than as a violation of fundamental rights”.
Respondents from the Balochistan High Court, meanwhile, argued that amendments to the act mirrored developments in the now-merged Federally Administered Tribal Districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: detention for “90 days without an FIR, under the pretext of ‘aid of civil power’”.
“They (respondents) expressed concerns that this would violate the right to due process and protection against arbitrary detention and custodial torture,” the report reads.
Key observations
The mission noted with concern that state narratives had framed enforced disappearances as part of the broader conflict in Balochistan, which “risks normalising what is considered a crime against humanity in international human rights law”.
According to the HRCP’s report, state lawmakers had “implied” that efforts for dialogue were postponed in the wake of an attack on non-Baloch citizens; a reflection of a broader pattern in which security goals overshadowed political resolution.
“Despite the finality of the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict in the Mohabbat Shah case (December 2013) — which explicitly identified the involvement of state elements in enforced disappearances and directed the government to ensure accountability — there has been little meaningful progress in implementing these directives,” the report read.
“The failure to act on the court’s findings reflects a broader pattern of impunity and lack of political will to hold security agencies accountable, thereby undermining both judicial authority and victims’ right to justice,” it added, noting that allegations of enforced disappearances must be taken seriously and investigated.
HRCP noted the increase in militant violence in Balochistan, but warned that amending the Anti-Terrorism Act would be “counter-productive to curbing militancy and crime”.
“Rather, the law is likely to further erode due-process protections, particularly in the absence of judicial oversight, and increase resentment among residents of Balochistan,” the report read, noting that it remains unclear whether those detained have access to their families or legal counsel.
“The mission notes that despite the state’s claims that it has enforced its writ through administrative control and legal reforms, significant structural, institutional and political deficits continue to hinder effective law enforcement and civilian oversight in Balochistan,” the report added.
The report expressed particular concern over the delegitimisation of human rights defenders such as Dr Mahrang Baloch and other BYC members, warning that “tarring (violent) militancy and (peaceful) advocacy with the same brush is likely to further alienate Balochistan’s population and particularly its youth”.
It added that “unless it (the state) urgently seeks an enduring, transparent and inclusive political solution to Balochistan’s legitimate grievances, the ongoing insurgency will remain difficult to quell.”
Recommendations
The HRCP recommended that enforced disappearances should be brought to an immediate end, urging the implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and domestic legislation against the practice passed in 2022.
 
 

“Disband the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which has failed to hold accountable those responsible for such practices (despite having the prosecutorial powers to do so), and instead establish a new commission with effective leadership and a fresh mandate to prosecute any state elements found responsible for perpetrating enforced disappearances,” it added.
The report also recommended ensuring a transparent and fair electoral process and investigating allegations of electoral manipulation, stating that such actions would restore faith in democratic governance.
HRCP also recommended withdrawing the Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act and reviewing all security-related legislation to ensure it lines up with international law and human rights standards.
“Guarantee due process and judicial oversight in all instances of detention and dismantle any form of indefinite or arbitrary detention,” the report recommended.
Noting that internment centres were replicated from those in KP, the report urged the state to decide pending appeals against the Peshawar High Court judgment on detention and formally notify these detention facilities as sub-jails.
Additionally, the HRCP urged that all individuals involved in militancy and crime be held accountable through transparent judicial processes in line with national laws and international human rights standards.
“The state must replace extrajudicial and opaque measures with credible, impartial investigations and fair trials, thereby reinforcing the rule of law and demonstrating the state’s commitment to justice and accountability,” the report recommended.
The report also recommended reinstating constitutional guarantees of provincial autonomy under the 18th Amendment, particularly regarding resource and minerals management, as well as demilitarising the province to create conditions that would enable meaningful dialogue.
“In the first instance, this could take the shape of a high-level national truth and reconciliation commission to promote interprovincial trust and reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to a federal and inclusive democracy,” the report read.
The report also recommended integrating Category A and B areas under civilian police control, ending Balochistan’s reliance on paramilitary bodies such as the Levies for law enforcement. It also urged the state to provide civilian police with equipment and training to perform their duties in line with human rights standards.
The HRCP additionally urged the state to cease actions against human rights groups, recommending that these groups be protected and treated in keeping with international human rights commitments. Additionally, the report recommended that the state act against those posing as polio workers who harass human rights defenders.
“Engage constructively with peaceful voices — even when they are critical of state policy — to foster a culture of democratic dialogue,” the report recommended.
“Immediately halt state interference, financial coercion and intimidation of media outlets and journalists,” the report recommended. “Ensure freedom of expression by facilitating unrestricted media coverage of human rights issues, public protests, and criticism of state policies, consistent with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”
The report also recommended opening the border crossings with Iran and Afghanistan to facilitate cross-border trade and reduce unemployment, while urging the state to halt the deportation of Afghans.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/062202333db88c5.jpg?r=220506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929126/xs-policies-sparked-anti-muslim-anti-migrant-narratives-after-southport-attack-report' target='_blank'><strong>X’s policies sparked anti-Muslim, anti-migrant narratives after Southport attack: report</strong></a><br><p>The design and policy choices of X created fertile ground for inflammatory and racist narratives targeting Muslims and migrants following last year’s deadly Southport attack in the United Kingdom, a new analysis showed on Wednesday.
According to research published by Amnesty International, social media platform X played a “central role” in the spread of false narratives and harmful content, which contributed to riots against Muslim and migrant communities in Britain.
The technical analysis of X’s open-source code or publicly available software showed that its recommender system, also known as content-ranking algorithms, “systematically prioritises” content that sparks outrage, provokes heated exchanges, reactions and engagement, without adequate safeguards to prevent or mitigate harm.
“Our analysis shows that X’s algorithmic design and policy choices contributed to heightened risks amid a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-migrant violence observed in several locations across the UK last year, and which continues to present a serious human rights risk today,” said Pat de Brun, head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International.
 
 

Far-right riots broke out across the UK following the stabbing attack by Axel Rudakubana in Southport on July 29 last year. The violence was fuelled by false online claims that the suspect, who is a British citizen born in Cardiff, Wales, was a Muslim asylum seeker.
Amid false claims circulating on social media platforms, many mosques, Islamic buildings, and hotels housing migrants were targeted across the country.
Algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing potential for causing harm
According to the research, as long as a post drives engagement, the algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing the potential for causing harm, “at least not until enough users themselves report it”.
“These design features provided fertile ground for inflammatory racist narratives to thrive on X in the wake of the Southport attack,” it added.
The study also noted that an account on X called ‘Europe Invasion’, known to publish anti-immigrant and Islamophobic content, posted shortly after news of the attack emerged that the suspect was “alleged to be a Muslim immigrant”.
It noted that the post garnered over four million views and within 24 hours, all X posts speculating that the perpetrator was Muslim, a refugee, a foreign national, or arrived by boat, were tracked to have an estimated 27m impressions.
Saying that the Southport tragedy occurred in the context of “major policy and personnel changes” at X, the study pointed out that since Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022, X has laid off content moderation staff, reinstated previously banned accounts, disbanded Twitter’s Trust and Safety Advisory Council, and fired trust and safety engineers.
Numerous accounts that had been previously banned for hate or harassment, including that of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right figure better known as Tommy Robinson, were also restored.</p><small>2025-08-06 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06213457f0dccad.png?r=213845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack' target='_blank'><strong>2 injured as Upper South Waziristan DC’s vehicle comes under attack</strong></a><br><p>Two individuals, including a police constable, were injured when the  South Upper Waziristan deputy commissioner’s (DC) vehicle came under attack near the Habib Kot Adana area of the district’s Ladha tehsil on Wednesday.
Upper South Waziristan Police spokesperson Shoaib Mehsood told Dawn.com: “According to the initial information, unknown assailants attacked DC Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle when he was travelling to Maken area from Ladha.”
He said the DC, additional DC (ADC) for planning and development, a police constable and an assistant to the ADC for finance and planning were aboard the vehicle.
The police spokesperson said that DC Wazir and the ADC remained safe in the attack, but the assistant for the finance and planning ADC and Constable Gul Nawaz were injured.
He said that the injured were taken to the district headquarters hospital for medical treatment.
The spokesperson said a police team was sent to the area and was conducting a search to track down the armed assailants.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Last week, armed men abducted a truck driver and two labourers while setting their vehicle on fire in the Ladha area.
A police spokesperson said unidentified assailants intercepted a truck near Habib Kot, a suburb of Ladha.
Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were killed in a clash between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in Dana area of Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-08-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06204805bf4a2a4.jpg?r=204812' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929106/phc-stays-ecp-action-against-ptis-shibli-faraz-omar-ayub' target='_blank'><strong>PHC stays ECP action against PTI’s Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday halted the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from taking any action against PTI leaders Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub.
The ECP on Tuesday disqualified Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Zartaj Gul, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week senten­ced over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.
Identical orders issued today by a bench comprising Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed said that Faraz and Ayub were in the process of appealing their convictions in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and had surrendered themselves before the PHC so they could approach the LHC.
The orders said that their convictions were not final and the ECP had not waited for the outcome of their appeals before disqualifying them. They directed notices be issued to the respondents in the matter and meanwhile, “the ECP shall not take any further process” under its notifications to disqualify the PTI leaders.
The orders adjourned both cases to Aug 20. The bench had granted protective bail to the two and Gul earlier today.
Talking to the media, Ayub said the ECP had disqualified him without following due procedure. He thanked the PHC for granting transit bail so he could file his appeal.
A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.
He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.

The development adds to the legal woes of the property tycoon and his real estate company, with the former being an absconder in the Al-Qadir Trust case, while the National Accountability Bureau has announced a fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town.
Delivering a televised press statement, Tarar said: “An important development occurred a day ago in the investigation of the Bahria Town corruption case. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) carried out a successful raid in which very important documents have surfaced that are incontrovertible proof of Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s corruption.”
He said the FIA had been conducting an ongoing investigation, with raids being carried out as well. “The documents that have surfaced reveal money laundering and corruption of a great amount by Malik Riaz and Bahria Town with the documents recovered so far showing evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering,” the information minister added.
Tarar said Rawalpindi’s Safari Hospital was being used as a “front office” where cash and records were kept.
“The hospital’s ambulances were being used to transport the money and records,” the minister said. “Not only does this prove illegal transactions and hundi hawala, but the money and documents were kept in the hospital so no suspicion arises.
“When the raid took place yesterday … two people — Imran and Kaiser — who ran the hawala and hundi operations, were linked to the Bahria Town chief financial officer and the evidence has been seized by the FIA,” he added.
Tarar alleged that Bahria Town’s leadership, CFO and finance director were “running a major money laundering racket through which amounts were being sent abroad”.
 


“There will be more amounts besides the Rs1.12bn that will come forth,” he said, adding that the investigation was only beginning.
“The setup in the hospital is clear evidence that billions were being sent out of the country illegally to damage the economy. None of this money was sent abroad through official or banking channels but through illegal means.
“As soon as the FIA carried out the raid, Bahria Town personnel tried to burn some of the records. Some documents were burnt, but we seized the majority of the records … If there was nothing illegal in that hospital, why burn records?” Tarar asked.
The information minister said that the “corruption racket” was being investigated, adding that it involved a lot more people and the FIA had information about the locations of others involved in the scheme.
“I ask these people to turn themselves in,” Tarar said. “Malik Riaz organised all of this and sending money abroad through hundi and hawala is a crime. We will bring more evidence before the public.
“Bahria Town CFO Amir Rasheed and Bahria Town head Shahid Qureshi have been linked to Imran and Kaiser, who were running a racket. Indisputable evidence proves that they were colluding in this mega corruption scandal,” the information minister said.
Tarar maintained that those living in Bahria Town would not be affected by the government’s investigation. “We are only investigating Malik Riaz, his officials and family members involved in this racket,” he clarified.
 






The development comes a day after Riaz called for “dialogue and a dignified solution” amidst Bahria Town’s legal troubles.
“I would like to make a final appeal from the bottom of my heart that we be given a chance to return to serious dialogue, and a dignified solution,” he wrote in a post on X.
“For this purpose, we assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent,” the property tycoon added. “On this occasion, I also assure you that if the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing.”
The property tycoon or Bahria Town have not yet responded to the information minister’s statements.
Bahria Town approaches SC against property auction
Separately, Bahria Town today filed an appeal against the NAB auction of its properties allowed by the Islamabad High Court.
“The impugned order … passed by honourable Islamabad High Court … as well as the order dated [March 19] passed by Accountability Court No.1 are contrary to the express provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, as amended by the Second Amendment Act, 2022, which provides that ‘upon failure of an accused to comply with a plea bargain Agreement, the Agreement becomes inoperative with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties immediately’,” the petition, available with Dawn.com argued.
The petition also argued that NAB “initiated a series of baseless and vexatious legal proceedings with mala fide intent to harass, pressurise and coerce the petitioner”, calling the manner in which NAB acted “discriminatory and prejudicial”.
“The courts … failed to appreciate that [NAB] does not have any authority to auction or sell the properties of the petitioner, in view of Section 33-E (recovery of amount of fines, etc as arrears of land revenue) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and the provisions of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967,” the petition argued.
The petition requested that the Supreme Court grant leave to appeal the IHC’s order.
