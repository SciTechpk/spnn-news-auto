Organised by DawnMedia, the summit is bringing toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as rapid population growth continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.



On Monday, policy­makers, experts, diplomats and lawmakers had expressed the unanimous view that prosperity was not possible if the number of mouths to feed kept rising.
They argued that without managing the population in terms of resources, all of the government’s efforts — aimed at development, progress and social uplift — would amount to nought.

1:02pm — No space for important issues, info ministries reduced to personal spokespersons: Arifa Noor
Senior journalist and DawnNews anchor Arifa Noor noted that there was “no space for important issues” amid the polarised political environment.
“What have the information ministries been reduced to? […] They’ve become personal of the political parties […] that’s still some virtue, but now they’re personal spoeksperson for individuals more or less.”
She also raised concern over “feel good legislation” that was passed by the parliament without considering how it would be implemented.

12:55pm — Empowering women’s choices ‘constitutional obligation’: NCSW head
National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) head Umme Laila Azhar termed the act of enabling women to make their own choices “a constitutional obligation”.
“Pakistan stands at a socio-economic crossroads, and empowering women’s choices is not just a soft issue; it’s a constitutional obligation,” she said.
She continued: “When girls and women can choose their education, work, mobility, marriage, and health decisions, entire communities become more resilient, productive, and peaceful, and this is not about individual empowerment; it is nation building.”

12:50pm — Healthcare providers discouraging many fertility management techniques: Madiha Latif
Stressing the need for women to make their decisons, Madiha Latif said women were often “infantalised” when they go into hospital emergency rooms or healthcare providers”.
“Providers are the ones discouraging a lot of these fertility management techniques,where they are telling her ‘you are too young to make that decision’ or that ‘you have only one child’,” she said.
“Who are those providers to make those decisions for us?” she asked. “We talk about nutrition and breastfeeding but we don’t give space to women to breastfeed safely at work.”

12:44pm — Madiha Latif stresses need to make women aware of their reproductive rights
Madiha Latif, vice president of Pathfinder’s Strategic Engagement and Innovation department, stressed raising awareness and knowledge among young women so they would have control over their body.
“Reproductive right is also the fundamental for gender equality,” she said, adding that the rights begin the moment a child is born.
“Since she hits puberty, what are we giving her in terms of her ability to negotiate sexually? Why are we still turningour faces around to gender-based violence that occurs?” she asked.
“Censorship is not the way to give anymore,” Latif asserted, noting the need to create awareness among women about their control and choices in sexual activities.

12:42pm — ‘We must educate men’: Shamama Tul Amber Arbab
Former president of Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry Shamamatul Amber Arbab highlighted the “friction” that results between men and women when women are made aware of their rights.
She said that the friction resulted because “we are not educating their counterparts, we are not educating the men in their families.”
[While] empowering women, we must at the same time educate men also, and that is how the tug of war will not take place. They will be empowered, they will know what their power is and exactly what their choices can be,” Arbab added.

12:38pm — Dr Yasmeen Qazi notes need to ensure ‘continuity’ in providing healthcare to women
QZ Catalyst CEO Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi emphasised the need to ensure “continuity” in providing healthcare to women.
“From adolesence to pregnancy to post-partum, at every point of her life, she would need that kind of information which we fail to provide in a classical facility setting,” she said.
Dr Qazi cited the example of Sweden, which reached nearly 0pc mortality rate “merely through advice”, and Ethiopia, where lady health workers were doing wonders.
“We need community-led accountability system,’“ she added, noting that women’s group would be the best agents to do that as they would understand women’s rights.

12:35pm — We need inclusion in ‘true sense’: QZ Catalyst CEO
Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi, who heads family planning consulting firm QZ Catalyst, underscored the need for inclusion in a “true sense” in response to a question regarding the delivery of interventions to undocumented communities.
“We need inclusion in a true sense…not for the data but for the very right that they deserve,” Qazi said.
“We should make a position that a woman’s autonomy and a woman’s right to make a decision should be central to all the policies we are leading,” she added.

12:22pm — Our rural communities are not as rural: Ayesha Leghari
Detailing a WhatsApp chatbot aimed at population growth in rural areas, Leghari remarked that Pakistan’s “rural communities are not as rural anymore”.
“We are more of a peri-urban shifted country as opposed to having deep rural communities and cities,” she said.

12:18pm — Ayesha Leghari stresses importance of ‘economic agency’ for women
Ayesha Leghari, Population Services International’s country director for Pakistan, echoed Tahira Abdullah’s comments and stressed the importance of providing women with “economic agency”.
“Giving women agency from an economic perspective is one of the most important aspects which we have seen,” Leghari said.
Detailing the outcomes of a PSI project aimed at uplifting women in rural areas, Leghari said: “These women did not have a say in their households before, but once they started becoming economic contributors in their households, their decision-making improved substantially, not just in their households.”
She noted women also became more autonomous in making decisions with regards to their bodies.
“They started choosing contraceptive methods of their choice, they started investing the money they were earning into their daughters, and we saw a dynamic change.”

12:10pm — Tahira Abdullah calls for ending ‘feminisation of poverty’
Activist Tahira Abdullah also called for an end to “feminisation of poverty”, which she described was the share of women in the country’s total poverty figures.
She cited World Bank and past figures, according to which 45pc of the country’s population lived below the poverty line, and women and transgenders made up 75pc of that.

 

The rights defender also demanded an end to unpaid labour by women.
She insisted that women’s labour force participation rate “might be 22pc in the official figures, but 100pc of Pakistan’s women, girls and transgenders worked”.

12:02pm — Conditional permission for birth spacing ‘unacceptable’: activist Tahira Abdullah
Tahira Abdullah, a rights defender, noted that the subject of population balance had become an “existential challenge”.
Donning a keffiyeh, she said that permission for anything should not be “conditional”.
She asserted: “When we give permission, it should be from a moral, ethical and rights-based background, not on a transactional basis.
“‘If a woman’s health is not good, then she can employ birth spacing’. I’m sorry; that is not acceptable,” the activist said, apparently referring to some religious scholars opining that birth spacing was allowed in Islam if there was a danger to the mother’s life.

11:46am — Need to focus on giving free of cost land to our people: Wahab
Replying to a query whether migration should be reduced, Murtaza Wahab termed Karachi an “extremely stretchable city”.
He noted that the city had a “humongous” land mass, which has tremendous potential.
The Karachi mayor underscored the need for development planning, noting that any restrictions on land allotment to the poor would lead to “unplanned growth in the city”.
“We should as a state be focusing on giving free of cost land to our people, incentivising them to develop proper settlements,” he said.

11:44am — Wahab calls for developing more cities as ‘alternate to Karachi’
Mayor Karachi was of the opinion that the state should invest in developing more cities to serve as alternatives to Karachi.
“I think as a matter of policy, Pakistan should be focusing on developing more cities, alternates to Karachi, so that the population can be moved to other cities as well,” said Wahab.

11:40am — Karachi faces brunt of Pakistan’s ballooning population: Murtaza Wahab
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in response to a question about long-term planning for Karachi’s population management, highlighted that his city was “facing the brunt of ballooning population”.
Wahab noted that “one common denominator amongst Pakistan’s problems is the ballooning population”. “Karachi, arguably, being the only cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, faces the brunt of it.”
He cited figures from the first census in 1951 when the population of Karachi was 1m, then it increased to 8.5m in 1995, and later, as per the census of 2023, “we are a city of 20.3m, which again is debated”.
Comparing it to the population growth in cities such as New York and London, Mayor Wahab said, “There is no example of a city anywhere in the world where the city’s population has increased over 20 times.”
“That shows that perhaps the state has not prioritised the issue of ballooning population, and the second aspect is that the state has not developed alternate places for people to reside,” he said.
“People from all over Pakistan come to Karachi,” Wahab added.

11:33am — ‘No govt has produced any amount of houses’
Arif Hasan recalled that although mnay governments promised constructing many houses, but “nobody has produced any amount of houses”.
On the PPP building “one-room houses” for flood-affected people, Hasan said, “Let’s see how it works out.”
Asked about pressing issues faced by the society, he said flooding was the biggest. He also stressed the need to control population density, adding that dealing with these issues required a major land reform.

11:28am — Arif Hasan terms ‘affordability’ biggest problem in housing
Asked about the national housing policy, urban planner Arif Hasan said he believed there was “no housing policy for the poor”. “It’s almost always the private sector that deals with this,” he added.
He termed affordability as the biggest problem, adding that another issue was that the only space available to the poor was at the city’s fringe.
“They are pushed out ot teh periphery or environmentally degraded areas,” Hasan said, pointing out that old katchi abadis were turned into high rises as the informal sector invested in that.

11:21am — Arif Hasan notes changing urbanisation trends
At the summit’s ninth session, titled ‘Population Challenges for a Highly Urbanised Pakistan in 2050’, architect and urban planner Arif Hasan detailed the rising trends in urbanisation.
“The major trend is social, which, of course, is a result of economic change.
“The extended family has reduced considerably, the nuclear family has evolved and consolidated, especially in the urban areas, and that gives a lot of freedom to individuals within nuclear families,” Hasan said.
He continued: “So women can acquire education, without pressure from their aunts and uncles, not to have an education. Also, the freedom to marry whoever they want, although this is not consolidated, but the trend is certainly there even within low-income groups.”

 

He noted that the shift to nuclear families “has changed settlement patterns as well”.
Speaking about changing trends in rural areas, Hasan observed that the “change in production patterns, mechanisation, fertiliser, middle man economy … all this has given rise to an economy where cash is desperately needed and that cash is not available in the rural areas”.
“So that has become a push factor,” he added.




11:15am — Not having women’s consent for pregnancy is inconceivable: Humaira Masihuddin
Humaira Masihuddin said that women bore the “main burden of pregnancy — physical, psychological and emotional“.
She said: “In every pregnancy, the risk and threat of death is very real. Not asking the person who has to take such a huge risk or their consent not being included is inconceivable.
“I cannot believe that the Sharia would ever allow something like this,” she added, prompting a huge applause from the audience.
Stressing the importance of justice in Islam, Masihuddin asked, “Where would the justice be in this if a pregnancy is forced upon a woman?”
“ […] Consultation is a cardinal principle in all relationships in Islam.”

11:08am — Women’s representation extremely important in family planning discussions: Humaira Masihuddin
Legal expert Humaira Masihuddin recalled that in July, the CII held a consultation with the Population Council to discuss “pregnancy issues” where 47 men and only three women were present.
“So I think this needs to be rectified; women’s representation is extremely important,” she asserted.
Masihuddin also stressed the importance of women in Islam, citing a Quranic verse that declares men and women each other’s “allies”.

11:06am — Dr Qibla Ayaz calls for ‘de-linking’ population with ‘rizq’
Dr Qibla Ayaz called for the need to “delink” the concept of rizq (sustenance) with population, and associate population with health instead.
“Scholars believe that rather than linking population growth with sustenance, link with health, because if you do not take gaps in childbirth, both the mother and child will suffer,” he stressed.
“The child will be born stunted, and the mother will be weak, and she will face difficulty in raising her children and guiding them towards a better future.”

11:00am — CII ‘coined’ concept of population balance, says Dr Ayaz
Dr Qibla Ayaz, a member of the Supreme Court’s Shariat appellate bench, appreciated the CII for “taking the lead” in the matter and “coining” the concept of population balance.
He recalled that “back in the 60s, it came to be known as family planning”.

10:50am — Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani says Pakistan has not utilised resources
While noting that the growing populace was an issue, Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani asked whether the country had utilised the resources given by God “in the right way”.
Citing the example of China, he said population was much larger there but it managed its resources.
“Allah has blessed our country with treasures worth billions, but we are selling those to others for pennies and not utilising our resources,” he said.
The Jamia Darul Uloom vice president noted that even the Sunnah underscored “moderation” in everything.

10:45am — Islam allows birth control in select situations: Jamia Darul Uloom vice president
Jamia Darul Uloom Vice President Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani also shed light on what the Sharia says about the issue of rapid population growth.
“Growing population is not an issue, it is a waseela,” he said, adding that a balance could be struck as birth control could be used in certain situations, such as when there was danger to a woman’s health.
However, Mufti Usmani said Islamic laws did not favour “birth control due to fear of poverty and starvation”, or if parents wanted to avoid a girl’s birth.

10:35am — Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad terms tackling population growth ‘a collective responsibility’
Chairman Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Abdul Khabeer Azad stressed that tackling population growth was “our collective responsibility”, recalling his 15 years of association with the Population Council.
Detailing their efforts, he said: “When we created this awareness that saving one human life was equivalent to saving the entirety of humanity, and then when we talked about the health of mother and child, people understood that this was indeed a noble cause.”
“We often see that when such topics come under discussion, they are labelled as foreign agenda, but we believe that the life of a person is very precious,” he added.

10:28am — ‘Religious scholars ready to play role in raising public awareness’
The CII chief affirmed that religious scholars were determined to play their role in raising awareness among the public.
“Neither are the scholars behind in this, nor do they think that birth spacing should not be adopted,” he said.
Dr Raghib Naeemi called for public sessions, discussions at the graduate level in colleges and universities, and formation of think tanks to work on the issue.

10:22am — Birth spacing parents’ duty: Council of Islamic Ideology chairman
CII chief Raghib Hussain Naeemi said that keeping in mind Islamic rules, appropriate birth spacing to consider the children’s health was the parents’ responsibility.
He further said that scholars of all sects were of the view that Sharia allowed for birth planning and spacing if there was danger to the mother’s health during pregnancy, or risk of “untolerable pain”, or issues related to lactation, or the mother would have to face multiple complications.
The CII chairman also advocated for a social media campaign to raise awareness. He said that Islam’s “fundamental principle” of balance also favoured a balance between resources and population.

10:20am — CII chairman terms family planning ‘Islamic responsibility’
CII chairman Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi recalled that in July, CII organised a conference aimed at discussing the Islamic perspective on population growth, where they adopted a resolution.
“The basis of our resolution was that the protection of the family system, the health of the mother and child, in the context of an increasing population…has become increasingly important”, he said.
He continued: “Quran and Sunnat have declared the protection of one’s life and their offspring as the fundamental purpose of Shariat, which is why the protection of one’s life, the betterment of mother and child, and family planning is an Islamic responsibility.”
“Keeping in view the Sharia, taking a gap between children is the responsibility of the parents in the context of their child’s health,” he added.

10:16am — Info minister calls for joint working group, parliamentary debate
Suggesting some steps that could be taken, Attaullah Tarar called for a charter on the population crisis and recommended that a debate be held in parliament.
“One size fits all strategy might not work,” he noted, adding that religion was not an impediment in population planning.
The minister called for a joint working group that could work on a charter on the issue.

10:11am — Postpartum depression is a reality: info minister
The information minister also highlighted that postpartum depression was a “reality which should be realised and accepted”.
He stressed that mental health was a major aspect of “health linked to the population problem”.
Tarar further wondered what role legislators and the parliament could play in this regard. The minister also pointed out that lack of resources was an issue.
“There needs to be a realisation of rights and responsibilities — who has rights and who has responsibilities.”

10:08am — ‘Right to life’ impeded by population growth: Tarar
Attaullah Tarar believed that the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution was directly linked to population growth.
“If one’s right to life gets impeded because of the population issue […] It is tragic,” he said.
The minister noted that “we were losing a lot of lives” due to issues amplified by the population explosion, particularly in relation to infant mortality rates, neonatal healthcare, mother-child healthcare, and reproductive health.

10:05am — Must acknowledge scale of issue: Attaullah Tarar
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar began by commending the DawnMedia group for speaking about the issue. He then stressed that, to him, “acknowledging the issue itself was quite important”.
“Until and less we accept it as a huge challenge, we will continue to face problems,” he said.
“First of all, it’s acceptance and the realisation that it is a huge issue,” the minister cautioned.

10:00am — 1st session of the day begins
Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, the senior director of the Population Council, is moderating the first session of the day.
The panel features Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Council of Islamic Ideology Chairman Allama Dr Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi, Jamia Darul Uloom Vice President Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani, Member of the Shariat Appellate Bench Dr Qibla Ayaz, Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Chairman Maulana Syed Muhammed Abdul Khabeer Azad and legal expert Humaira Masihuddin.




9:58am — Population Council official speaks
Ali Mazhar, the director of communications at the Population Council, opened the second day.
He said that the first day of the summit focused on the gap between an expanding population and the available resources.
Experts highlighted that ensuring a safe and educated Pakistan is not possible until we take better steps for population management, he said.
Mazhar also noted that the role of Islamic scholars in tackling population growth came under much discussion.
“Scholars have the most influence on our family planning and societal behaviour,” he noted.

9:56am — 2nd day of Pakistan Population Summit begins
The second and final day of the Pakistan Population Summit has begun in Islamabad. The day kicked off with the recitation of the Holy Quran.</p><small>2025-12-02 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02131257fe7cc3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958740/ahead-of-pti-protests-in-twin-cities-tallal-chaudhry-says-compliance-with-section-144-will-be-ensured' target='_blank'><strong>Ahead of PTI protests in twin cities, Tallal Chaudhry says compliance with Section 144 will be ensured</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said on Tuesday that compliance with Section 144 would be ensured in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where the PTI plans to hold protests today.
“Whether they come to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) or the Adiala jail, action under Section 144 would be carried out without any discrimination,” Chaudhry warned while speaking to the media in Islamabad. He particularly urged PTI-backed parliamentarians to “abide by the law”.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
The opposition has decided to stage protests outside the IHC and Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail — where PTI founder Imran Khan is incarcerated — against restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights.
According to reports from the twin cities, security arrangements have been in place in Rawalpindi, with pickets set up on routes leading to the Adiala jail. Meanwhile, roads leading to the Red Zone, which houses key government buildings, from Serena Hotel and the National Database and Registration Authority office have been blocked.
During his media talk, Chaudhry said Section 144 had been imposed in the twin cities “in light of intelligence reports”.
He further linked the matter to terrorism, saying: “Terrorists look for instances [which they can use] to spread fear and make headlines; be it [a] political gathering, courts or important places or offices.”
The state minister further said that terrorists used social media applications, particularly for communication. “They use these apps with virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their identities and locations.”
So, Chaudhry continued, the interior ministry had decided that it, along with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), would find a solution to this problem.
“The PTA has issued a detailed press release regarding the registration of VPNs,” he said, adding that the government did not want IT-related businesses to be affected by this measure. “But, it has to be done at any cost to ensure that mobile and social media apps are not used for terrorist activities.”
The state minister also recalled that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had ruled that state resources were not to be used for political activities.
So, “we hope that the KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) chief minister, who repeatedly comes to Islamabad and Pindi, will not use state resources for his political activities”, he added.
The state minister asserted that “KP police will [only] be used in KP for security”.
“If they come to Islamabad or any other province, prior intimation will be required in a proper manner. If any state resources are used without any intimation, action will be taken and criminal cases will be registered against government employees [concerned], in line with the PHC’s directive,” he warned.
He further stated that Section 144 had been imposed for the protection of lives. “An incident has occurred in Islamabad, and threats still exist,” he said.
The minister pointed out that the PTI had staged protests in Rawalpindi, demanding meetings with Imran, several times.
The administration, he said, was closely monitoring the situation to ensure that citizens’ lives and peace in the city were not affected. “To ensure that such gatherings of protests do not cause any loss.”
Here, he also recalled the violent protests of May 9, 2023, which were held after Imran’s arrest. “They will do it themselves just like on May 9, and entire Pakistan will face the consequences. They will do it themselves, and will then deny [any responsibility].”
He maintained that KP Chief Minister had no authority to demand a meeting with Imran.
Reiterating that Section 144 had been imposed in light of terror incidents. “And I hope that terrorists will not be facilitated — that such gatherings are held where they could carry out [terror] activities with ease and spread fear in Pakistan. We have made foolproof security arrangements, and God willing, no such incident will take place. But, we need the cooperation of other political parties and civil society to ensure this.”
He again warned Section 144 would be “strictly imposed” and action would be taken in light of the PHC order if any provincial public office holder used state resources for political activities.
To a question about whether Imran would be shifted from the Adiala jail to a prison in Islamabad, Chaudhry said: “It is too early to say anything.”
The minister said that the prison’s construction was in its last stages, after which its staff would have to be trained. “That jail is not being constructed for just one prison. It was needed in Islamabad as prisoners from the federal capital had to be sent to jails elsewhere,” he added.
He also said if the authorities were provided all the necessary documents and “tracking number, Imran’s sons would be issued visas in the next 24 hours”.
Plan for protests
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said on Monday the opposition lawmakers from both houses of parliament will protest outside the IHC before taking their demonstration to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and other leaders will stage protests in the twin cities, Qaiser said.
Last week, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time. Similarly, the ex-premier’s family members have not been allowed to meet him for several weeks. There were also speculations about his health, but the government and the PTI leaders had said that he was in good health.</p><small>2025-12-02 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021247054bce99b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958742/2-cops-among-3-martyred-as-assistant-commissioners-vehicle-comes-under-attack-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>2 cops among 3 martyred as assistant commissioner’s vehicle comes under attack in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Three people, including two cops, were martyred after terrorists attacked the vehicle of Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu on Tuesday.
The spokesperson for the regional police officer (RPO) Kashif Nawaz confirmed the incident to Dawn, adding that the attack took place within the limits of the Cantt police station.

 

He added that two constables and a local citizen were martyred in the attack, while two other police officials were injured.
Unconfirmed reports said the assistant commissioner had died in the attack, but there was no official confirmation.
Miranshah is the administrative headquarters of North Waziristan district and is adjacent to Bannu.
The development comes a day after two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TTP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.</p><small>2025-12-02 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02105715be463d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958737/passengers-with-complete-documents-not-being-stopped-from-travelling-reassures-naqvi-during-visit-to-lahore-airport' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers with complete documents not being stopped from travelling, reassures Naqvi during visit to Lahore airport</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited the Lahore airport on Tuesday, where he again asserted that passengers with “complete documents” were not being barred from travelling, state-run PTV News reported.
“No passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” he said, adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.
Naqvi’s assurance and warning follow recent reports of arbitrary offloading at airports of passengers travelling abroad. The reports prompted clarifications by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) that only passengers without complete and correct documents were being stopped from travelling.
The interior minister has also issued similar statements, saying that only those lacking genuine and complete documents were not being allowed to travel abroad.
During his visit to the Lahore airport today, he reiterated the same.
“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.
The state broadcaster reported that the interior minister also reviewed the immigration process and the system in place for linking passengers’ travel histories with their identity cards and passports at immigration counters.
“He appreciated the performance of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Ali Zia and his team on the fast-track system,” the PTV News report said.
Moreover, he visited the immigration counters designated for Pakistanis returning from abroad and enquired from passengers how long the immigration process took.
Passengers expressed satisfaction with the immigration process, the report said, further quoting them as saying that the process was “completed in just two minutes”.







Recently, several incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown on migrant smuggling following last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
Addressing the matter during a press conference in Lahore yesterday, Naqvi claimed that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country.
The minister reasserted that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad. He added that the action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”.</p><small>2025-12-02 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0113550827c4b28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958516/information-ministry-nccia-to-take-action-against-fake-news-on-massive-scale-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Information ministry, NCCIA to take action against fake news on ‘massive scale’: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Monday that the information ministry, along with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), would be taking action “on a massive scale” against fake news.
The minister said this during a press conference in Lahore, where he said he believed that “since the past few days, past few weeks, 90 per cent news on social media is fake”.
Saying so, Naqvi also clarified that he believed in the freedom of expression and liberty to criticise.
He also highlighted that in case false news was reported by a platform in the mainstream media, a complaint could be registered with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. Similarly, he continued, a reporter associated with a news outlet would be answerable to their director news or the bureau chief in such a scenario.
“But, on social media one can post any photo, make news as per their wish and post it,” he said, adding that he had spoken to the information minister today morning, and “we will not allow this”.
Naqvi added, “If you have evidence, you can report any story. But it cannot be allowed that you say whatever you want on social media, make any allegation against anyone, [declare] any living person dead and [declare] a dead person alive. This cannot happen.”
The information ministry, along with the NCCIA, would carry out a “crackdown on this on a massive scale”, he said.
“We will not allow you to spread fake news across the country and create panic […] in the garb of journalism.”
The interior minister then went on describe “who is a journalist for us”.
“Journalists are responsible, those who are part of the national media. They work as part of a system. Every institution has a system of check-and-balance and an editorial board,” he said, adding that individuals working as part of these systems “are journalists for us”.
On the other hand, those who spread fake news were “not journalists for us. We are very clear on this”, Naqvi further stated.
He went on to say: “Whether you produce vlogs or a podcast, […] run news responsibly.”
The minister once again emphasised that journalists and freedom of expression held significance for the government, but the spreading of fake news could not be permitted.
Later, when a journalist asked him whether a regulatory body would be established in connection with the new measure announced by Naqvi today, the minister replied: “I think one is already being established.”
He also asserted that this measure was “not against journalists”, but only those spreading fake news. In this connection, he gave the hypothetical example of “someone saying that an ABC person has died”.
He added that after making such a statement, one would have to take responsibility.
Answering another question, he said the action taken by the information ministry and NCCIA “will not be an operation or a crackdown, but simply an action against anyone spreading fake news without any evidence”.
Asked about “a political party running a campaign from India” — apparently, a reference to PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters giving interviews to Indian outlets recently — Naqvi said: “I want people to get exposed. Others should know who can go to what extent. The country’s integrity is a boundary that you don’t cross and join the enemy. Let it happen.”
In this context, Naqvi was also asked about criticism directed toward Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He replied, “The state is clear […] we will not spare them. Someone in London says that there is a problem within our institutions, says something about our generals, posts photos. This will have to stop.”
Without naming anyone, he added: “Those sitting out there, let me tell you, you are also coming back soon. And if you think you will get protection here, that is not possible. We will soon bring you back, and you will be answerable.”
Afghan migrants
At the outset of the press conference, Naqvi said the authorities were facing difficulties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with regards to sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan. This was not the case in the three other provinces, he added.
Afghan migrants, he claimed, were being “protected in KP”. He further alleged that the federal government had de-notified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them remained operational in KP.
Highlighting the involvement of Afghans in terror activities, he mentioned that terrorists who attacked Federal Constabulary headquarters a few days ago — ostensbily a reference to an attack in Peshawar on November 24 — were also Afghans.
Naqvi added that station house officers (SHO) in police were now being assigned the task to identify and locate “illegal Afghans” in their respective areas so that they could be sent back to Afghanistan. Instructions had also been issued to inspector generals for the collection of data via SHOs.
“Our message to the KP government is also that it is important at this time to prioritise your country over politics,” he said, adding that the KP government would have to ensure the implementation of the federal government’s decision “as we cannot afford any more bomb blasts”.
He added, “My message to illegal Afghans is to leave yourself respectfully. Because if you get caught now, we will not just send you back.” Without further elaborating on this statement, Naqvi also warned that if any Afghan returned to Pakistan after being sent to Afghanistan, they would be arrested.
Asked whether the Centre was mulling going to the court against KP government over the alleged non-cooperation on the matter of Afghan, Naqvi said multiple options were being worked on.
“When it comes to national security, it cannot happen that a province makes it own policy. We will not allow this.”
Offloading of passengers
On the matter of officials denying boarding to passengers travelling abroad, Naqvi maintained that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country.
“I have asked the FIA (Federal Investigation Agency) to share this data so that people how realise how an agent mafia is running a campaign on social media. Because obviously, they are the ones who will actually face consequences in this matter,” he said.
The minister said that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad.
He went on to say that action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”.
Speculation about notification
Naqvi was also asked about a “notification” and the speculation about it on social media.
It seemed to be a reference to the delay in the issuance of the notification for the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment. Observers described the delay in CDF’s notification as “baffling”, noting that it has signalled to the opposition that something may be amiss in civil–military relations.
In his response, Naqvi, seemingly referring to the speculation on social media, said: “Let them do it”.
He then went on to explain that “a new institution is being established after an amendment in the Constitution. They want things to happen at the press of a button, but things don’t work that way. A system has to be established, and it takes days, hours. It’s not that you press a button and it will become a part of the Constitution”.</p><small>2025-12-02 05:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0210172704e8165.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958735/hong-kong-leader-orders-independent-probe-into-fire-that-killed-151' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong leader orders independent probe into fire that killed 151</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong’s leader said on Tuesday an independent committee would be established to investigate the cause of the city’s deadliest fire in decades, including oversight of renovations blamed for the disaster that has claimed 151 lives.
Police have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter in a criminal investigation into last week’s disaster, and the anti-corruption body has also arrested 12 people in a probe into possible graft. It is unclear if any of those people were arrested on both counts.
Authorities have pointed to substandard plastic mesh and insulation foam used during renovation works at Wang Fuk Court as fuelling a blaze that quickly spread to seven high-rise towers, home to more than 4,000 people.
“In order to avoid similar tragedies again, I will set up a judge-led independent committee to examine the reason behind the cause and rapid spreading (of the fire) and related issues,” John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, told a news conference.
Investigators have combed all but two of the seven burnt-out towers, finding bodies of residents in stairwells and on rooftops, trapped as they tried to flee the flames. Around 30 people are still missing.
With pockets of public anger simmering, some groups have called for more transparency and accountability, amid warnings from Beijing and Hong Kong that any attempts to politicise the disaster would be severely punished.
Asked about the detention of a student from one of the groups, and two others who media reported are being investigated for possible sedition, Lee said: “I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.”
He did not comment on the specific cases.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both issued statements criticising the reported arrests.
“Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire … rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,” Amnesty International said.
China’s national security office has warned individuals against using the disaster to “plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos” of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests challenged Beijing and triggered a political crisis.
“We sternly warn the anti-China disruptors who attempt to disrupt Hong Kong through disaster,” the office said in a statement.
“No matter what methods you use, you will certainly be held accountable and strictly punished.”
Legislative elections due to take place on Sunday will go ahead as planned, Lee said.
Residents warned of fire risks
Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining about fire hazards posed by the renovations, the city’s Labour Department said.
The residents raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the mesh that contractors used to cover the scaffolding, a department spokesperson said.
Tests on several samples of a green mesh that was wrapped around bamboo scaffolding on the buildings at the time of the blaze did not match fire retardant standards, officials overseeing the investigations told a news conference on Monday.
Contractors working on the renovations used these substandard materials in hard-to-reach areas, effectively hiding them from inspectors, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said.
Foam insulation used by contractors also fanned the flames and fire alarms at the complex were not working properly, officials have said.
Thousands of residents have turned out to pay tribute to the victims, who include at least nine domestic helpers from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.
Vigils are also due to take place this week in Tokyo, Taipei and London.
Search moves to worst affected buildings
The remaining buildings being scoured for remains are the worst damaged and the search may take weeks, authorities have said.
Images shared by police showed officers clad in hazmat suits, face masks and helmets, inspecting rooms with blackened walls and furniture reduced to ashes, and wading through water used to douse fires that raged for days.
More than 60 pets, including 34 cats, 12 dogs and 7 turtles, perished in the fire, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said. More than 200 were rescued.
The apartment blocks were home to more than 4,000 people, according to census data, and those that escaped must now try to get their lives back on track.
Nearly 1,500 people have been moved out of evacuation centres into temporary housing, with a further 945 put up in youth hostels and hotels, authorities said.
With many residents leaving behind belongings as they fled, authorities have offered emergency funds of HK$10,000 ($1,284) to each household and provided special assistance for issuing new identity cards, passports and marriage certificates.</p><small>2025-12-02 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692e50d509750.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958683/a-tall-tale-about-renaissance' target='_blank'><strong>A tall tale about renaissance</strong></a><br><p>DEC 6 marks the day the Babri masjid was destroyed 33 years ago. Before the 1992 outrage, the day was observed by India’s Dalits and their supporters solemnly as the death anniversary of their hero Bhimrao Ambedkar who left the Hindu fold on Oct 14, 1956, converted to Buddhism and passed away on Dec 6. The choice of the date to stage the mosque’s destruction served Hindutva’s bid to shift the focus from a politically inconvenient centuries-old caste strife to an electorally expedient, vote-rich Hindu-Muslim binary. The binary was spawned by British administrators after the close call of 1857, and led to Partition in 1947. It still works as an ideological template for Indian and Pakistani politicians and analysts 70-plus years after independence.
Field Marshal Asim Munir, for example, recently used the binary to explain the coming about of Pakistan, which he said he would protect with every sinew of the militarised state. It is another matter that today the threat to Pakistan comes not from a predominantly Hindu neighbour alone but also from an avowedly Muslim one. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used the binary routinely to advance his quest to turn a culturally diverse country into a monolithic Hindu rashtra, which he goes about doing with a mix of street power, media control and bureaucratic subterfuge.
Unwittingly, liberal ideologues on both sides of the border subscribe to the binary, albeit to support their essentially agreeable belief that Hindus and Muslims can and did live in harmony together. The endless liberal praise for ‘Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb’, for instance, flows from this understanding. They rightly claim that Hindus and Muslims together did once make an alluring cultural blend.
Seen closely, however, the idea shows up as inexorably elitist, borrowing from the assertions of the Ishtehaarnama, an official gazette, published by the last queen of Awadh as she waged a valiant battle against British troops in 1857. Begum Hazrat Mahal encouraged Hindus and Muslims to unitedly defeat the foreign enemy. Her 1858 exhortation had rudiments of the Ganga-Jamuni appeal, which it undid in the same breath: “Everyone follows their own religion (in my domain). And enjoys respect according to their worth and status. Men of high extraction, be they Syed, Sheikh, Mughal or Pathan among the Mohammedans, or Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaish or Kayasth among the Hindus, all these retain the respectability according to their respective ranks.” In the Ishtehaarnama, Hazrat Mahal revealed another view about Indians who did not qualify for Awadh’s favours. “And all persons of a lower order such as a Sweeper, Chamar, Dhanook, or Pasi cannot claim equality with them.”

Modi in his own view thus became India’s answer to Lorenzo de Medici, Michelangelo and Copernicus rolled into one.

The lament didn’t end there. “The honour and respectability of every person of high extraction are considered by (the British) equal to the honour and respectability of the lower orders. Nay, compared with the latter, they treat the former with contempt and disrespect. Wherever they go, they hang the respectable persons to death, and at the instance of the Chamar, force the attendance of a Nawab or a Rajah, and subject him to indignity.”
The charming Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, harking to a cultural mingling of Hindus and Muslims, fettered itself by appealing exclusively to the elites of the two main religious communities. The pointed exclusion of the lower caste Hindus as well as Muslims from its purview was the secular appeal’s undoing. Going deeper into the breach, a “Muslim Dalit” — mehtar or halalkhor, for instance — is denied the benefits of affirmative action available to the “Hindu Dalit”, thus driving a readily exploitable wedge between members of the most abused layer of the caste pyramid.
Riding the crest of a major electoral victory in Bihar in November, Modi returned to Ayodhya last week in the company of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat where they unfurled a traditional saffron flag atop the Ram temple to the applause of an assembly of tycoons, movie stars and cricketers. The prime minister had inaugurated the Ram temple hastily in January 2024 ahead of the May elections, which his party lost, leaving coalition partners to keep him in power. To rub salt in the wound, the BJP candidate was trounced in Lord Ram’s Ayodhya by a Dalit opponent.
The journey to the Hindu rashtra thus began to seem as uphill as it was uncertain and distant. Its votaries needed to help themselves to prayer and pretence to protect the morale of their teeming cadres. Thus in Goa last week, Modi declared that India under his watch was witnessing a cultural renaissance. Modi in his own view thus became India’s answer to Lorenzo de Medici, Michelangelo and Copernicus rolled into one. The claim though conflated state-backed pummelling of India’s cultural mix and scientific timbre to launch into orbit a deliberately anti-intellectual and therefore politically convenient majoritarian polity.

 

There was something else being targeted here, and these were what can be called India’s truer heart-warming renaissance moments. The Bengal Renaissance, for instance, was destined to be the 19th-century critique of many regressive ideas and practices the BJP would embrace to undermine Nehru’s liberal promise. The 19th-century cultural, intellectual, and social reform movement saw path-breaking progress in areas like literature, science, and education. Key figures like Rabindranath Tagore and Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain contributed to the intellectual and social landscape. Kerala had its own renaissance as did other regions of an India that was not yet a nation state. A common theme in the social reforms movements was rationalism and included renunciation of idol worship.
And here was Modi, inaugurating a 77-foot statue of Lord Ram in Goa to announce India’s renaissance. How could idols sans Vedic endorsement become a symbol of any renaissance particularly when the art of carving statues arrived with Alexander in fourth century BC? Idol worship was not a practice in early Vedic times; instead, worship focused on personified natural forces through elaborate rituals and hymns. The concept of idols and temples gained currency by the post-Mauryan eras. To Modi and Hindutva, however, that’s not the point.

The Galaxy Z TriFold will go on sale on December 12 and costs more than twice as much as the new iPhone 17 at $2,443.
Super thin, it unfolds to a 10-inch (25.4 centimetre) display, offering “increased possibilities for creating and working”, the South Korean tech giant said.







The triple fold function is not world-first — China’s Huawei beat Samsung to the punch last year with a phone at a similarly exorbitant price.
Growth has been patchy in the competitive smartphone market, pushing makers to find new, eye-catching ways to differentiate their products.
Offered solely in a black design, Samsung’s new device comes in at 309 grammes (10.9 ounces) and at its thinnest point measures less than 0.2 inches.
Generative artificial intelligence features are integrated into the phone, which can give real-time help through screen or camera sharing.
Samsung admitted the Galaxy Z TriFold was “not intended for mass sales”.
Kim Seong-eun, Executive Vice President at Samsung Electronics said it was a “special edition” product.
The launch comes as recent industry numbers suggest Apple is on track to overtake Samsung for the first time in 14 years as the world’s top smartphone maker through 2029.
Apple has also long been rumoured to be planning a foldable iPhone, possibly as early as next year.
The US company’s smartphone shipments are expected to reach a global share of 19.4 per cent in 2025 while Samsung is expected to hold 18.7pc– with Apple effectively dethroning its rival for the first time, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p><small>2025-12-02 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692e5131c5c31.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958684/strategic-ambitions' target='_blank'><strong>Strategic ambitions</strong></a><br><p>THE clouds of uncertainty are gradually disappearing as Pakistan’s well-thought-out Middle East strategy becomes clear. Islamabad has shown an eagerness to expand its security footprint in the Middle Eastern region with renewed security cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels. This is evident from the signing of its mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia, which proposes the creation of an ‘Arab-Islamic task force’, supporting US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, participating in the Gaza-based international stabilisation force (ISF), and offering a mutual defence pact to Qatar.
Islamabad’s security activism in Middle East is its new currency of relevance. But this raises a critical question: why is Islamabad pursuing an elevated role in Middle Eastern geopolitics?
First, Pakistan has already established substantial institutionalised security cooperation with several Arab Gulf countries. For instance, the deployment of troops, training of naval and air officers, weapons procurement, joint military exercises, etc, are areas where operational cooperation in various fields already exists between Islamabad and some of these countries. By building upon existing institutional frameworks and adding new security measures, Pakistan wants to be strategically relevant to the Middle Eastern region. There is a realisation within the civil and military leadership that in the past, Pakistan missed a strategic opportunity when its parliament voted for declining the invite to join the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.
Islamabad now believes that Pakistan paid significant strategic, economic and political costs due to its decision of neutrality in the Middle Eastern conflicts. The policy of neutrality had downgraded Pakistan’s strategic relevance, and dented Islamabad’s credibility as a reliable security partner. Therefore, Islamabad seems eager to rebuild trust with its Arab partners with renewed strategic overtures.

Islamabad’s security activism in Middle East is its new currency of relevance.

Second, Islamabad’s higher security stakes and strategic relevance in the region would ensure sustainable economic assistance and uninterrupted oil flows even during the prospective armed conflict with New Delhi. Moreover, the elevated role on the security horizon would likely ensure deepening joint defence production, and research and development in weapons technologies, with various Arab Gulf states.
Third, Islamabad has calculated that its proactive security overtures in the Middle Eastern region will likely complement Washington’s interests. For instance, the Saudi-Pakistan pact and Islamabad’s participation in the ISF will allow Washington to offload some of its Gulf security responsibilities onto a capable regional partner, lowering Pentagon’s need for permanent deployments. Moreover, being Washington’s traditional ally, Islamabad’s presence will strengthen a pro-US security architecture in the Middle East. Islamabad’s security assurances to Riyadh will serve as a deterrent to entities deemed hostile such as the Houthis and will discourage Iran from initiating a proxy campaign to strategically encircle Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Islamabad and Washington both share interests in securing energy routes. By actively participating in Middle Eastern security affairs, Islamabad could come closer to Washington’s strategic calculus.

 

The Biden administration remained under the impression that Islamabad had already opted for Beijing over Washington. The growing economic and strategic ties between China and Pakistan were viewed by Washington as an indicator of Islamabad’s choice. Although Islamabad remained consistent in its position of balancing between US and China, it could not convince the Biden administration. However, Trump’s positive gestures and convergence between Islamabad and Washington on the Middle East security architecture have helped Islamabad reiterate its stance on two major powers.
Lastly, Pakistan is concerned about the Indian growing influence in the region. New Delhi’s cultivation of partnerships with the Arab Gulf states has been viewed negatively in Pakistan. The growing Indo-Arab relationship is taken as an attempt by New Delhi to deprive Islamabad of reliable economic and strategic partners in the Arab Gulf region. Therefore, Islamabad is keen to have a greater strategic role in the Middle Eastern security architecture, so that it can limit Indian influence in the region.
Despite these calculations, Islamabad’s expanded role in the Middle East will bring complex, multilayered foreign policy challenges.
First, Islamabad views the Arab Gulf countries as a monolithic entity, which is a flawed approach. The six GCC states have adopted distinct policies and strategies to various geopolitical conflicts in the MENA region. Moreover, the smaller Arab countries are concerned about Saudi Arabia’s monopolisation of the regional security architecture. By aligning more closely with Riyadh, Islamabad might have disturbed the strategic calculations of some of the smaller Arab Gulf states, which could create diplomatic and economic problems for Pakistan.
Secondly, a proactive role in geopolitical conflicts will dent Islamabad’s credibility as a ‘neutral’ state that could facilitate mediation between the Arab Gulf states as it did during the Qatar diplomatic crisis.
Third, Tel Aviv will likely not welcome Pakistan’s elevated role in the Middle Eastern region. Pakistan’s growing role in the region will provide another reason for Tel Aviv to ally itself more closely with India for an Indo-Israel strategic partnership, which could further embolden New Delhi to act against Pakistan.
Fourth, Islamabad’s stakes in the Middle Eastern security architecture are growing at a time when Tehran is at its weakest position since 1979. The recent Israeli and American air strikes inside Iran have also weakened Iran’s regional ambitions. Therefore, Iran might not be in position to openly challenge Pakistan’s elevated role in the regional security architecture. However, if Iran seeks to reclaim a larger strategic role in the regional security architecture, it will inevitably increase pressure on Pakistan’s diplomacy. Joint Saudi-Pakistan retaliatory measures against the Houthis could further unsettle Iran’s ambitions, forcing Islamabad to make difficult choices between a neighbour (Iran) and a strategic partner (Saudi Arabia). Already, the Houthis’ recent seizure of an LPG vessel carrying 24 Pakistanis signalled their displeasure with the Islamabad-Riyadh defence agreement.
Lastly, Islamabad’s active role in Middle Eastern conflicts could reignite internal sectarian fault lines. Therefore, Islamabad must now weigh its choices with precision: is the price of stepping into the vortex of Middle Eastern security rivalries truly lower than that of becoming a distant economic partner?

Published in Dawn, December 2nd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-02 04:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958680/second-thoughts' target='_blank'><strong>Second thoughts</strong></a><br><p>THE Sharm el-Sheikh Gaza summit, held in October, was punctuated by rhetoric about how peace had been won in the Middle East. Donald Trump was being hailed by many as a visionary peacemaker, though more critical observers were of the view that the US president’s Gaza plan was flawed, and tilted towards Israel.
Today, those fears have been confirmed, as the implementation of the Trumpian plan — which was endorsed by the UN Security Council last month — is proving quite difficult. In particular, many of the Arab and Muslim states that had backed the plan are having second thoughts about committing troops to the so-called international stabilisation force. These states, including Pakistan, have started to reconsider their commitments when confronted with the prospect of having to forcefully seize Hamas’s weapons.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar was quite clear about Pakistan’s reluctance to confront and disarm Hamas during a presser on Saturday, when he said that this was “not our job”. The visiting Egyptian foreign minister further said, with reference to Gaza, that “our … mandate must be monitoring the ceasefire”.
Together with these official statements, a recent report in the Washington Post has confirmed that many Muslim states are getting cold feet about the Gaza mission, particularly confronting Hamas. Reportedly, Indonesia and Azerbaijan, two nations that could contribute troops, are reconsidering their commitments. In fact, Mr Dar publicly said that his Indonesian counterpart had “expressed his reservations” about disarming Hamas. He added that clear terms of reference were needed about the Gaza mission.
These developments reflect the fact that Muslim states — in their enthusiasm to back Mr Trump’s plan — forgot to read the fine print. Demilitarising Gaza has been a part of the plan since day one. However, Muslim states may have belatedly realised that if they were to forcibly confront Hamas and other Palestinian resistance factions, this would be akin to aiding Israel. This would be a hard domestic sell even for the most pro-American Muslim states, as these governments would be seen to be aiding Tel Aviv in its bloody conquest of Gaza.

 

Considering the fact that many observers feel that the genocide in Gaza continues, albeit at a slower pace, no Muslim state would want to be publicly seen backing this US-Israeli endeavour. The fact is that Muslim troops should have no role in disarming Hamas or other Palestinian factions, or in enforcing Israel’s writ in Gaza.
Pakistan and other backers of the Trumpian scheme should re-examine their support for the plan. Any scheme that prioritises Israeli objectives, does not provide a concrete plan for Palestinian statehood and the end of Zionist occupation, and fails to hold Tel Aviv to account for the Gaza genocide should have no support from the Arab and Muslim world.

The availability of Nvidia circuits also enables enterprises to access advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing and for the locally hosted AI infrastructure.

 

The development comes amid restrictions by the US on Nvidia from exporting its AI chips, particularly to China, amid a trade war between the two powerhouses. Data Vault, however, said they had a “special” approval from Nvidia for their GPUs.
Besides export restrictions, global GPU shortages and high import costs have also limited Pakistan’s ability to adopt enterprise-grade AI.

Powered by Nvidia enterprise-grade GPUs, data centre to boost artificial intelligence adoption, improve cybersecurity by keeping data within country

However, this project, which was approved after strict checks, provides Pakistan with an opportunity to capitalise on Nvidia accelerators to unlock its AI potential.
The move is likely to upgrade Pakistan’s AI adoption across sectors, such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, public safety, logistics, agriculture, and government services, by providing the high-performance computing power and compliance-ready environment needed for modern AI applications.
Mehwish Salman Ali, Data Vault chief executive officer, said Data Vault Pakistan was the only data centre in the country providing GPU services. “Though it is difficult, we have obtained more than 3,000 GPUs for usage and provide them as services,” Ms Ali said, adding, “This has made us the only AI-enabled data centre based in the country.”

 

According to Ms Ali, Data Vault Pakistan has “official and special” approval from Nvidia for GPUs and they buy these from Nvidia partners.
“There is a global shortage of GPUs and there are US export-control sanctions. Pakistan is also on the restricted list, so in normal circumstances, no one in Pakistan can buy these enterprise-grade GPUs legally,” she said, adding that their company went through very “strict technical, compliance and financing checks” for this.

 

“We started this process early, committed to a multi-year programme and went through their authorised partners, so our project was approved,” she added.
It may be noted that GPU is a specialised electronic circuit designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a component on a discrete graphics card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. This partnership will also help Telenor customers to gain on-demand access to GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS).
Data protection
The company has said that the availability of sovereign GPU infrastructure locally will help Pakistani researchers, startups, enterprises, and universities develop LLMs for Urdu and regional languages, as well as sector-specific AI for fintech and other purposes. As AI is redefining every industry, the core of this revolution lies in GPU computing.
Moreover, by keeping all data within Pakistan, the sovereign cloud strengthens cybersecurity, defence, auditability and transparency, access control and identity management, privacy and digital trust, and national data protection.
As data processing will be entirely within Pakistan’s borders and hosted inside Data Vault’s high-density AI data centre, this will eliminate the risk of the transfer of sensitive datasets, including financial transactions, healthcare imaging, telecom data, and government records, to be processed outside the country.
Currently, there are several sovereign cloud services primarily managed by telecom companies, including the state-owned PTCL and the National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC). But the Pakistani enterprises and public institutions have relied on offshore cloud regions for AI workloads.

Shah Ghulam Qadir

MUZAFFARABAD: Pakis­t­­an Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir was on Monday designated Leader of the Oppo­sition in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative As­­sembly, replacing Khawaja Fa­­rooq Ahmed of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
Earlier in the day, senior PML-N leader and former prime minister Raja Farooq Haider visited the chamber of Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar to submit an application, signed by all nine PML-N lawmakers, proposing the name of their regional president for the opposition leader’s slot, a position that carries perks and privileges equivalent to those of a cabinet member.
In the Speaker’s absence, the application was handed over to his staff member, Chaudhry Murad Ali.
Later, a notification issued in the afternoon by a deputy secretary stated: “Under Rule 17(a) of the Rules of Procedure of the AJK Legislative Assembly, the Speaker has approved the appointment of Shah Ghulam Qadir as Leader of the Opposition on the basis of the opinion of the majority of opposition members.”

Two PTI’s forward bloc members about to switch loyalty, PML-N claims

Highly placed PML-N sources told Dawn that Mr Haider was also an aspirant for the office, but the party’s top leadership — PM Shehbaz Sharif and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif — had approved Mr Qadir’s name.
During the recent change of government, PML-N lawmakers had voted in favour of the no-trust resolution against Mr Haq, which subsequently brou­ght PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore to power. However, they had made it clear that their support was limited to ous­­ting Mr Haq and that they would not be part of the government.
Following the installation of the present assembly in August 2021, Mr Akbar — the incumb­ent Speaker — had been the fi­­rst opposition leader on the joint recommendation of the PPP and PML-N.
Interestingly, even aft­er both parties joined the coalition government led by Chau­dhry Anwarul Haq — the leader of the PTI renegades — on April 20, 2023, Mr Akbar continued to hold the office until June 3, when he was elected Speaker. Mr Ahmed was subsequently designated Leader of the Opposition on July 11, the same year.
The PTI had originally held 32 seats in the 53-member house, but its two-thirds majority splintered during the formation of the coalition government in April 2023.
Of the remaining 22 PTI renegades, 12 have formally joined the PPP, three are aligned with the PPP without formal induction, and one joined the PML-N. Five PTI dissidents appear to be operating as a separate gro­up, while Pir Saeed ‘s future poli­­tical course remains unclear.
A PML-N lawmaker claimed that two PTI “forward bloc” members from Mr Haq’s group were likely to join the PML-N in the near future.

Winding up the debate on a motion moved by JUI-F’s Kamran Murtaza in the Senate on Monday, the finance minister said the report covered seven areas, including judicial oversight and corruption, and identifies structural deficiencies — which he termed a positive development. He said it provided 15 recommendations for institutional reforms.
He assured the Senate that work on these recommendations was underway, citing the recent law passed by parliament requiring public servants to declare their assets. “We will share our action plan on institutional reforms with the public and parliament,” he said, adding that such diagnostic reports had been released for many countries and represented best practices to assess governance in other jurisdictions.
He dismissed concerns over a delay in releasing the report, which some critics linked to corruption-related findings, saying the process took time because input had to be gathered from relevant institutions.

Aurangzeb rejects delay claims, cites thorough review process

The finance minister rejected the perception that the government had delayed or attempted to withhold the publication of the IMF report, telling the house that the document underwent a rigorous review process involving extensive consultations. “I come from the private sector,” he said. “When a report is issued, it is circulated among departments, feedback is taken, some points are incorporated, others are rejected.”
Mr Aurangzeb said that around 100 meetings were held and more than 30 institutions were involved in the compilation process. He dispelled the impression that the IMF report had any connection to the latest audit report of the Auditor General of Pakistan or a separate report issued by the State Bank of Pakistan.
He also endorsed points raised regarding governance improvements, professional capacity in technical ministries and remuneration reforms. These matters, he said, were being reviewed by the Civil Service Reforms Committee headed by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, of which he is also a member.
The finance minister also highlighted the government’s efforts to digitise the economy, emphasising its potential for transparency and efficiency, saying it was faster, cheaper and more transparent.
He added that the FBR chairman should brief lawmakers on steps taken to shift towards a digital economy. Kamran Murtaza suggested referring the matter to a committee for discussion, calling the report an important document that raised concerns about the country’s judicial system and overall governance.
Climate change
Meanwhile, Federal Minister Aurangzeb on Monday said climate change is an urgent economic reality for Pakistan, reaffirming the government’s commitment to advancing sustainable finance, implementing green taxonomy and establishing climate-aligned disclosure frameworks.
Stressing the need to support SMEs in formalising their financial reporting practices, he highlighted the country’s proactive regulatory approach in digital assets and emerging technologies, where new institutional frameworks are being established to integrate innovation into a formal, transparent, and compliant economy.
The finance minister made these observations while meeting a delegation, led by Jean Bouquot, president of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).—With input from APP

In its latest monthly report, the Islamabad-based think tank said 292 people were killed and 164 injured in anti-state violence and security forces’ counter-measures across the country in November.
PICSS noted that November witnessed “more measured actions” by security forces, reflected in a steep decline in their losses — from 72 fatalities in October to 25 in Nov­ember — a reduction of about 65pc. Civilian deaths, however, surged by 80pc, rising to 54 in November compared with 30 in October.

 

Data showed that militants accounted for the overwhelming majority of those killed as 206 militants — about 71pc of total fatalities — were eliminated during the mon­th, while militancy also claimed the lives of seven members of pro-government peace committees.

PICSS records 292 fatalities in November

The injured comprised 83 security forces personnel, 67 civilians, 10 militants and four peace committee members.
The report said the country experienced 97 militant attacks in November, up from 89 in October. Mainland Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) remained the main theatres of counter-militancy operations, with the killing of 137 militants in the former and 58 in the latter.
The month also recorded a notable spike in suicide attacks. Four suicide bombings were documented in November, compared with just one in October. One attack each occur­red in Islamabad, KP, Balochistan and erstwhile Fata.
These attacks left 31 people dead, including 15 militants, 12 civilians and four security forces personnel. A total of 64 people were injured in suicide attacks, among them 41 civilians and 23 security forces personnel.
The report underlined that suicide bombings have increased on a year-on-year basis. PICSS said 24 suicide attacks were recorded in the first 11 months of 2025, compared with 17 in all of 2024, indicating a clear upward trend in this particularly lethal tactic.
Overall, the first 11 months of 2025 have been exceptionally bloody. Citing its database, PICSS reported a total of 3,144 conflict-related deaths between January and November 2025. These include 1,940 militants, 626 security forces personnel, 563 civilians and 15 members of pro-government peace committees.
It assessed that 2025 is the deadliest year for militants since 2015.

MEMBERS of the Hazara American Community hold a banner honouring the National Guard killed in the Washington attack.—Dawn

WASHINGTON: Afg­han Americans from different neighbourhoods gathered outside the White House to urge the US administration not to hold an entire community responsible for the actions of a few individuals.
Amid heightened scrutiny of Afghan nationals, following reports of alleged involvement in terrorism-related incidents in the United States, the Hazara community on Sunday organised the rally to press the authorities to take a lenient view.
The US Justice Department announced on the same day, that Afghan-born permanent resident Abdullah Hajizada had been sentenced last week to 15 years in federal prison. Hajizada, 17 at the time of his arrest, pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply firearms and ammunition for an ISIS-inspired plan to carry out a terrorist attack on election day in November 2024.
He had allegedly obtained two AK47-style rifles and 500 rounds of ammunition, “knowing they would be used to commit a violent federal crime,” the Department of Justice said. Upon completion of his sentence, US authorities will remove Hajizada to Afghanistan and terminate his permanent-resident status.

Afghans For A Better Tomorrow representative notes Lakanwal ‘worked alongside US Special Operations forces in CIA-backed covert units’

US authorities may also deport the family of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington last week, one of whom later died. A day earlier, Afghan national Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was arrested in Texas for allegedly making terror-related threats.
“Criminal responsibility lies with the individual, and the actions of one person should never be used to stigmatise or punish an entire community, immigrant group, or ethnic minority,” said the Hazara American Community. The community, which organised Sunday’s rally, has long faced targeting in Afghanistan because of their religious beliefs and ethnic heritage.
Afghan-American evacuees and immigrant-rights organisations have spoken out against collective blame.
“Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion, or legal status,” said Matthew Soerens, vice president of World Relief, “we urge our country to recognise these actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who share the same characteristics.”
Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, said many in the Afghan refugee community are terrified. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans. He represents himself,” VanDiver said.
“The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished,” said Richard Bennett, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan.
Arash Azizzada, co-director of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow, warned against “using this tragedy to demonise, criminalise, or target an entire community.”
He also noted that Lakanwal “worked alongside US Special Operations forces in CIA-backed covert units that operated without oversight and have a documented history of human rights abuses against Afghan civilians over two decades.”
Also, Evacuate Our Allies condemned the attack but denounced the “alarming vilification of an entire community based on the actions of a lone individual.”
The group added: “Collective blame is not only unjust but dangerous. It undermines the immense sacrifices our nation’s Afghan allies made — sacrifices that cost many their safety, homes, loved ones, and, in too many cases, their lives.”

The meeting, mediated by Saudi Arabia late on Sunday evening, was aimed at addressing tensions between the two countries following border clashes in October and Pakistan’s demand for action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
According to officials, the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by Anas Haqqani and Rahmatullah Najib. The Pakistani side included officials who had participated in earlier rounds in Istanbul under the Turkiye-Qatar track. A diplomat from the Foreign Office (FO) was added to the Pakistani delegation.
However, unlike the lengthier sessions held in Doha and Qatar, the Riyadh conversation wrapped up quickly, with one source describing it as “a short exchange rather than extended negotiations”.

Saudi authorities facilitate talks quietly; Pakistan rejects appeal for bilateral trade resumption; another round of negotiations likely

Sources said Islamabad reiterated the clear message that Kabul must take concrete action against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist groups based on Afghan soil.
The Taliban delegation, too, held firmly to its stance, resulting in no tangible movement.
Trade resumption
Saudi officials, who remain keen to play a sustained diplomatic role, urged both sides to keep channels open. They also encouraged Pakistan to consider allowing the resumption of bilateral trade while counterterrorism dis­c­­­u­­s­­sions continue. The proposal was, however, rejec­ted by Islamabad, the sources added.
The Riyadh initiative came as the separate Tur­kiye-Qatar-mediated track rema­ined stalled. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier signalled plans to send a delegation to Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. The Turkiye-Qatar effort had produced a fragile ceasefire, though the FO spokesperson said the truce had faltered because it was “contingent on a halt in terrorist activities”.
Despite the lack of breakthrough, sources said, Saudi Arabia intends to stay engaged and may convene another round of talks in the near future.

Speaking on a point of order, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan member Iftikhar Alam strongly protested the incident and asked when the provincial government would address the issue.
He said that a large number of manholes across the city, including the areas administered by cantonment boards, were without covers.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s lone MPA Muhammad Farooq called for the mayor’s resignation, citing repeated failures in ensuring public safety.

Muttahida stages walkout; JI wants mayor’s resignation; PTI demands stringent laws; Sharjeel promises accountability

Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmaker Rehan Bandukda expressed deep sorrow over the incident and pushed for new laws to hold officials accountable for negligence leading to such incidents.
The situation took an unpleasant turn when Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed denied Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi to speak about the tragic incident, leading to a walkout by the MQM-P members.
Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon assured the house that those responsible would be punished, emphasising that human life was precious.
“The chief minister has ordered an inquiry into the incident, and the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation has been directed to investigate,” he added.
Mr Memon said that as soon as the incident occurred, rescue teams had reached the spot, and all the images of the rescue operation were available.
He said that the city mayor had told him that 88,000 sewer covers have been installed this year.

 

The senior minister said that the person whose negligence caused this incident must be held accountable, and if there was any responsibility on his part as a minister, he was ready to accept it.
He emphasised that nothing was more precious than human life and that ensuring safety was a collective responsibility.
Mr Memon praised the opposition’s approach in raising this issue and assured that a strictest action would be taken against any officer of any department found negligent, and full action will also be taken against those responsible for this incident.
Later, Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah adjourned the house to Tuesday (today).

ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday took a strong exception to reported anti-parliament statements made by Pakhtunkhwa Mili Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — nominated as opposition leader by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) but not notified by the custodian of the house so far — declaring that he would firmly defend it.
Without naming Mr Achakzai or giving specifics, Mr Sadiq said the MNA entered the Parliament House and announced in the opposition lobby that he planned to approach the [speaker’s] chair in order to disrupt the proceedings when Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah was presiding. He added that the same member later issued another “irresponsible and provocative statement”, declaring he would use public force to halt the parliamentary proceedings.







“This is my responsibility to protect parliament. It is inappropriate to talk against the state and parliament. We will all stop it together,” said the speaker before formally announcing the start of the Question Hour.
He said such thinking and statements must be collectively discouraged to ensure parliament’s supremacy, preservation of the constitutional system and protection of democratic traditions.
Mr Sadiq’s remarks put the opposition PTI members on the defensive as party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and later a number of other party members, assured the speaker that their party had no intentions to attack parliament.
The PTI chairman asked the speaker not to escalate the matter, stating that the politicians had the right to issue statements about the parliament’s functioning.
When Barrister Gohar in his speech referred to Mr Achakzai as the opposition leader, the speaker interrupted, saying that he didn’t recognise him [Achakzai] in this capacity.
The office of the opposition leader has been lying vacant since August after disqualification of Omar Ayub due to his conviction in May 9 cases. The PTI has nominated Mr Achakzai as the new opposition leader in the assembly, but the speaker has so far refused to issue his notification, while terming the matter sub judice in a court of law.
Lamenting the opposition’s past “confrontational politics”, the speaker revealed that during the 2014 sit-in when he was presiding over the joint session of parliament, he received a chit from outside, threatening him to wind up the proceedings within five minutes, otherwise the “cousin brothers” — a term which was previously being used for PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) chief Dr Tahirul Qadri — could put the lives of the members in danger after storming parliament. He said that they stayed determined at that time and remained present here to face any such situation.
The speaker recalled that parliament had played a pivotal role in safeguarding the constitution and democracy in 2014, affirming that they were fully prepared to firmly counter any such attempts.
Mr Sadiq stressed that if anyone claimed they would bring people to attack parliament, they might attempt so, but such tone and language would never be acceptable. He asserted that the Parliament was the house of the people, and its dignity would be protected at all costs.







Earlier, Barrister Gohar said they had always talked about strengthening the parliament and democracy. He recalled that in the past the PPP and the PML-N members also had had assembly sessions outside the Parlia­ment House. He said the history sho­w­ed that in the past too, the people cal­led parliament “bogus and fake”.
“Do not create a divide that takes us to an irreversible situation and puts the democracy and constitution at stake,” he asked the speaker.
He recalled that Mr Achakzai was the person who had challenged Gen Zia’s dictatorship. He said Mr Achakzai had been with the PML-N and the PPP for decades whereas he had been speaking in support of the PTI only for the past three years.
Under the rules, he said, Mr Achakzai had the right to become the opposition leader. He said that he guaranteed on the floor of the house that they would not attack the parliament, adding had they intended to make such a plan, they would do it on the oath-taking day or when parliament was passing the controversial constitutional amendments.
Resolution blocked
The speaker allowed ruling party member Shumaila Rana to read out a resolution, condemning Mr Achakzai’s remarks and seeking his disqualification as members of the house, but didn’t put it for a vote.







“What is the need of moving a resolution? Have we become so weak that we will require the help of resolutions ….. you just read it and we will not vote for it, because we have the courage to give a befitting response to the anti-parliament, anti-state, and anti-Pakistan elements,” said the speaker while asking Ms Rana to read out the resolution.
Talks offer
Responding to Barrister Gohar’s speech, the speaker stated that all the members of parliament were fully aware that his doors had always remained open. He said all his efforts for reconciliation and dialogue were before everyone and were neither hidden nor ambiguous. The speaker remarked that the prime minister, the law minister, and he himself had repeatedly made it clear that issues could only be resolved through dialogue, not confrontation.
“Speak to me with respect and goodwill. I have no objection. I am fulfilling my constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities,” he added, while once again making an offer to play a mediatory role between the government and the opposition.
He further stated that on that day he had extended an offer of dialogue to the opposition leader, but the response he received was: “Talk to India, talk to Afghanistan — but I will not talk to you.”
Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI also stressed the need for a political dialogue, but regretted that in the past the talks broke down when the government didn’t allow them to have a meeting with jailed party leader Imran Khan. He said political dialogue could only be held if they were allowed meetings with Mr Khan.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, however, categorically stated that such “undemocratic demands” could not be met.
Governor’s rule
PTI’s Asad Qaiser criticised the treasury benches for suggesting the imposition of governor’s rule, saying the federal government had adopted an “undemocratic attitude”.
“If the government is thinking about governor’s rule, then do whatever you want, but you know you won’t be able to handle its political repercussions,” Mr Qaiser warned.
However, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stated that the governor’s rule was not the face of any martial law as it was provided in the Constitution by its creators. He argued that if the conditions merited it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.
The National Assembly later passed the Federal Prosecution Service (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the National Commission for Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025.
The NA will meet again today (Tue­s­day) at 2pm after a joint sitting of the two houses of the parliament, which the government had already convened to pass some pending legislations.

The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27. It will be a dual-hatted position combined with the office of the army chief.
A day prior, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the notification would be issued “in the due course of time” and urged people to refrain from speculation.







Speaking to reporters at the Pakistan National Arts Council, Tarar said, “The notification will happen; there’s nothing for you or me to worry about. He’s holding the office in all respects.”

 

The minister elaborated that official processes are underway to issue the notification.
“The PM is out of the country right now, so once he returns, everything should happen,” he added. “Maybe the paperwork will be completed by then.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is currently on a visit to London and, according to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, is expected to return today.
The law minister further explained that notifying the new CDF is the defence ministry’s job, and they have to coordinate with the PM’s office.
Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but November 29 was seen as a critical marker, being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent army chief was set to expire.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament last month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defence framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision is the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.
Meanwhile, the National Command Authority (NCA) Act still requires amendment to reflect the abolition of the CJCSC and the emergence of the CDF and NSC commander under Article 243.
The changes are expected to be complex, particularly regarding the placement of the new posts relative to the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy chiefs and whether the air force and navy heads will retain representation in the NCA once their strategic commands are subsumed under a unified NSC commander.</p><small>2025-12-02 02:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01192215ea4e19a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958547/govt-defends-governors-rule-as-constitutional-option-pti-leaders-warn-of-political-fallout' target='_blank'><strong>Govt defends governor’s rule as constitutional option; PTI leaders warn of political fallout</strong></a><br><p>The government stressed on Monday that the imposition of governor’s rule in a province is an option provided by the Constitution, even as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi dared the Centre to impose the measure.
The federal government is seriously considering imposing governor’s rule in KP, citing “security and governance issues” in the province as the reason for this potential move.
“Governor’s rule is not the face of any martial law. It is provided for in the Constitution by its creators,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar while speaking at the National Assembly today.
He argued that if the conditions merit it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.
Similarly, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also told reporters, “It is a constitutional option that is available to every government, so such discussions arise when governance is weak. Let’s see how matters proceed.”
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhary advised CM Afridi not to exacerbate friction between the Centre and the province.
Chaudhry said the federal government had tried to keep the KP chief minister on board with every development related to terrorism and other issues, adding that CM Afridi should fulfil his responsibilities as the provincial chief executive and desist from “political point scoring” at every opportunity.
Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said governor’s rule was an option for the government, but “no final decision had been taken yet”.
In a later interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah reiterated his government’s stance that governor’s rule was an option under consideration, but stressed that there was a clear difference between that and a decision being taken.
“There has been no decision about this, but this is an option under consideration.”
He elaborated that the future would depend on CM Afridi’s course of action.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi had called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week to discuss matters concerning the province, including the imposition of governor’s rule.
The discussion on the occasion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation, during which Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal were also present.
Among them, the issue of imposing governor’s rule in KP was discussed reportedly due to a rigid stance by CM Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
CM Afridi dares govt to impose governor’s rule
On the other hand, CM Afridi dared the federal government to impose governor’s rule in KP.
“We are not afraid of governor’s rule. If they are so bold, then let them try and impose it,” he said while talking to the media in Peshawar.
Questioned about the law and order situation in the province, he responded: “Those who have implemented policies [framed behind] closed doors should realise this.”
CM Afridi assailed the federal government for not giving the province its due share of finances, saying the provincial government was taking positive measures in various sectors with its own available resources.
Addressing an event in Peshawar, he said over Rs3,000 billion were owed to KP by the Centre. “Just imagine what we will be able to do if that amount is given to the KP government and people. Discriminatory treatment is being done to us,” the chief minister added.
Afridi also slammed the federal government over the scale of institutional corruption highlighted in the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar ruled out any notion of governor’s rule being implemented in KP.
Questioned about the issue outside Parliament House today, Barrister Gohar said the situation would improve and ruled out the possibility of governor’s rule.
“I don’t at all see it. Neither are the conditions there, nor will there ever be. People should not engage in rumour-mongering and the province cannot bear governor’s rule.”
He added that the province was beset by terrorism and the PTI government would strive to eliminate it and improve law and order, adding that CM Afridi should be given time.
“Hopefully governor’s rule will not be implemented and the province will be run as per the law and the Constitution,” Gohar said.
When asked about the protest call in KP tomorrow against the denial of meetings with Imran, Gohar said it had been almost a month since the last meeting with the PTI founder, and claimed that he was being kept in isolation.
“He is the people’s leader and he has representation in Parliament, so this is very wrong, and there should be meetings so matters can be streamlined.”
Speaking in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser criticised the treasury benches for suggesting the imposition of governor’s rule, saying the federal government had adopted an “undemocratic attitude”.
“If the government is thinking about governor’s rule, then do whatever you want, but you know you won’t be able to handle its political repercussions,” Qaiser warned.
The PTI’s parliamentary committee also warned that any such move to impose governor’s rule would create further instability, spread disputes, and worsen the law and order situation in the province.
It also claimed that such actions were neither in the interest of the country nor in the interest of KP, would carry serious political repercussions and would be an insult to the public mandate.
It said the party would protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and Adiala Jail on Tuesday against the persistent lack of meetings with Imran.
Qaiser said it was decided that MNAs, MPAs and senators would protest outside the IHC in the morning and then move to Adiala jail.
“It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Qaiser told Dawn that the parliamentary committee held a meeting today in which the possible removal of the KP governor and imposition of governor’s rule were discussed.
He said the meeting’s participants were of the view that the KP government was elected through the votes of the people and any attempt to destabilise the government would be an insult to the votes of the masses and would create unrest and instability in the province.
Qaiser said that due to the policies of the federal government, the province was suffering economically and politically, along with facing a law and order situation.
“The parliamentary committee was of the view that the federal government has failed to pay the rights of KP as per promises under the National Finance Commission and other announcements made at the time of merger of tribal districts,” he said.
He said that a peace jirga was held in KP in which all political parties agreed to address the issues of the province and eradicate terrorism. However, he said the federal government did not give any positive response to it.
Qaisaer said that it was impossible to build good relations with the federal government due to its harsh attitude.
He said the country and the province could not afford another conflict and suggested addressing the issues with Afghanistan through dialogue, adding that as a first step, people residing on both sides of the border should be allowed to meet and trade.
Qaiser said that the parliamentary committee also demanded Imran’s release, adding that it was a violation of his human rights to stop him from meeting his family members and party leaders.</p><small>2025-12-01 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01234507ed851d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958574/senate-passes-bill-to-protect-rights-of-under-trial-prisoners' target='_blank'><strong>Senate passes bill to protect rights of under trial prisoners</strong></a><br><p>The Senate on Monday passed a landmark bill aimed at protecting the rights of arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation individuals in the country.
The ‘Rights of Persons Arrested, Detained or under Custodial Investigation Bill’ was moved in the upper house by former Senate Chairman and PPP leader Farooq Naek.
Speaking in the House, Naek said Article 14 provided that the dignity of man was inviolable and that the bill outlines various rights and protections, including the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest in writing, legal counsel, access to family, food and medicines and a medical examination by an independent doctor.
The PPP leader stated that these rights were available to under-trial prisoners worldwide and that, for now, they have to move the courts to get these rights.
Naek added that a man is innocent until proven guilty and his rights must not be usurped.
“They are under trial prisoners before conviction,” he remarked, adding that convicts lose some of their rights.
He said the bill also includes a provision of the right to remain silent before a police officer in the absence of a lawyer and prescribes a fine for the police officer who violates the provision. The bill also provides for the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest.
Additionally, the bill protects against torture or cruel treatment and aims to ensure that individuals are treated fairly and humanely while in custody and to prevent abuses of power by law enforcement agencies.
The statement of objects and reasons of the bill reads:
“The present Act seeks to define the rights of persons arrested, detained or under custodial investigation as well as the duties of the persons arresting, detaining or investigating offences. It further deals with the provision of assisting advocates by the State and their remuneration (Section 8). The Act is in line with rights granted to persons arrested, detained or under custodial investigating throughout the world as well as Article 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. It is an attempt to herald the dawn of the human rights revolution in Pakistan”.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said there were certain reservations over the bill, but he did not oppose it. He indicated that some amendments may be introduced when the bill comes under consideration by the National Assembly.
The Senate also unanimously adopted a bill to amend the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, moved by Shahadat Awan, which has already been cleared by the House standing committee concerned.
He explained that he has proposed an amendment in Section 3 of the act, providing that the victim’s family could file a suit for an interim order from the court for an amount and that this order will be incorporated in the final decree.
Likewise, the related cases, he noted, will have to be decided within six months.</p><small>2025-12-01 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/012138457644197.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958569/india-permits-pakistani-humanitarian-overflights-to-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>India permits Pakistani humanitarian overflights to Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) received permission from India to use its airspace for humanitarian aid flights to Sri Lanka to provide flood relief, diplomatic sources confirmed to Dawn on Monday.
The Sri Lankan government called for international aid and used military helicopters to reach people stranded by flooding and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah. At least 355 people have been killed, Sri Lankan officials said on Monday, with another 366 still missing.
An official in the foreign ministry told Dawn that earlier this evening, the Indian high commission sent written confirmation allowing humanitarian overflights through Indian airspace. The flights have been cleared to start tomorrow.
The toll in deadly flooding and landslides across parts of Asia climbed past 1,100 on Monday as Sri Lanka and Indonesia deployed military personnel to help survivors.
Separate weather systems brought torrential, extended rainfall to the entire island of Sri Lanka and large parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia last week.
Much of the region is currently in its monsoon season but climate change is producing more extreme rain events and turbocharging storms.
The relentless rains left residents clinging to rooftops awaiting rescue by boat or helicopter, and cut entire villages off from assistance.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s aircraft since tensions between them escalated in April in the wake of an attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people and the subsequent four-day conflict. In October, Islamabad extended the airspace ban until November 24.</p><small>2025-12-01 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01202500ca6a64e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958559/tajikistan-says-5-chinese-nationals-killed-in-cross-border-attacks-from-afghanistan-in-past-week' target='_blank'><strong>Tajikistan says 5 Chinese nationals killed in cross-border attacks from Afghanistan in past week</strong></a><br><p>Five Chinese nationals have been killed and five more injured in Tajikistan in attacks launched from neighbouring Afghanistan over the past week, Tajik authorities and China’s embassy in the Central Asian country said on Monday.
China’s embassy in Dushanbe, the capital, advised Chinese companies and personnel to urgently evacuate the border area.
It said that Chinese citizens had been targeted in an armed attack close to the Afghan border on Sunday. On Friday, it said that another border attack — which Tajik authorities said had involved drones dropping grenades — had killed three Chinese citizens.

 

Tajikistan, a mountainous former Soviet republic of around 11 million people with a secular government, has tense relations with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan. It has previously warned of drug smugglers and illicit gold miners working along the remote frontier.
China, which also has a remote, mountainous border with Tajikistan, is a major investor in the country.
There was no immediate response on Monday from the authorities in Afghanistan to the Tajik statement.
But Afghanistan’s foreign ministry last week blamed an unnamed group, which it said was out to create instability, and said it would cooperate with Tajik authorities.
Tajik President Emomali Rahmon’s press service said on Monday that Rahmon had met with the heads of his security agencies to discuss how to strengthen border security.
It said that Rahmon “strongly condemned the illegal and provocative actions of Afghan citizens and ordered that effective measures be taken to resolve the problem and prevent a recurrence of such incidents”.
Tajikistan endured a brutal civil war in the 1990s after independence from Moscow, during which Rahmon initially rose to power. The country is closely aligned with Russia, which maintains a military base there.
Millions of Tajiks, a Persian-speaking nation, live across the border in Afghanistan, with Tajikistan historically having backed Afghan Tajiks opposed to the Taliban.</p><small>2025-12-01 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01110608b1280a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958504/body-of-3-year-old-boy-who-fell-into-open-manhole-in-karachis-gulshan-i-iqbal-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Body of 3-year-old boy who fell into open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal recovered</strong></a><br><p>The body of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night was recovered on Monday, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
The development was confirmed by both Rescue 1122 and Edhi, with the latter adding that the body was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
Images shared on social media last night had showed a large number of citizens gathered in the area as rescue work was underway. Other videos also showed the child’s distraught mother calling on someone to save her child.
Earlier, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the service’s central command received information about the incident at 10pm on Sunday night.
He said the boy was with his parents, who were shopping at a private departmental store near Nipa. He said the boy fell into the manhole after the family left the store.
Khan added that Rescue 1122 did not usually initiate search operations at night due to a lack of visibility. But, since a “highly charged” crowd had gathered and the parents were grief-stricken, officials initiated the search operation, he said.
The spokesperson further said that the Rescue 1122 team had asked the authorities concerned to provide the blueprint for the underground drainage system.
Karachi mayor cautions against politicising incident
Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said he would initiate an inquiry into the incident but cautioned against politicising it.
“Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame and rhetoric,” he said. “If there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?”
He said that he would conduct an inquiry as to how long the manhole had been left open in the middle of the city, near a large department store which was visited by thousands daily.
“How it was open or was it left open at that time … this will be checked,” he said.
“If there was carelessness on the part of the government, I assure you we will take action,” he said.
Wahab also said he would ask the union council chairman concerned about whether it had been communicated that the manhole was left open as he questioned the funds provided to the councils.
“This is very unfortunate,” he said, talking about the incident. “I will refrain from political rhetoric, but I will say once, and for all that we will have to decide whether we will focus on assigning blame or actually try to find solutions to people’s problems.”
‘How many more will die?’
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman slammed the Sindh government for “playing with the lives and health of Karachi’s citizens” in the name of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects.
Speaking to the media in Karachi, he said the construction of the projects had resulted in the destruction of roads. “BRT projects in Karachi should be stopped due to their numerous flaws, which are causing traffic issues and endangering lives,” he said, as he went on to speak about the incident at Nipa.
“ Today, a boy fell into a gutter and died [sic],” he said, questioning that “how many more will die?”. He held the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation responsible for the incident and condemned the incident.
The JI chief’s accusation apparently stemmed from the digging at University Road between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology for the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project.
The city’s roads were also dug for BRT projects, which Rehman said the authorities should abandon, citing concerns over the safety and well-being of citizens. Referring to frequent road accidents and incidents such as people falling into manholes, he questioned, “Who will take responsibility for the 3.5 crore population of Karachi?”
He said Karachi was generating 90 per cent tax revenue in the country but still faced problems.
“The Sindh government has collected 3,306 billion rupees in  taxes, infrastructure funds, and development charges, but has failed to utilise these funds for the development of Karachi. Instead, they engaged  in corruption,” he alleged.
He appealed to the people of Karachi to join the JI in its efforts to hold the government accountable and fight against land grabbers and corruption.
Past incidents
Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger. The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
In September, three sanitation workers died by falling into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood.
In May, a six-year-old boy fell into an open manhole in Karachi and drowned, causing a a protest by residents and politicians which prompted the police to register a case.
In April, the body of a young girl was recovered from a drain in Liaqatabad after being reported missing.</p><small>2025-12-01 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0119003758b11dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958493/ticking-time-bomb-leaders-experts-at-pakistan-population-summit-call-for-urgent-govt-action-to-tackle-rapid-growth' target='_blank'><strong>‘Ticking time bomb’: Leaders, experts at Pakistan Population Summit call for urgent govt action to tackle rapid growth</strong></a><br><p>Day 1 of the ‘Pakistan Population Summit’ concluded on Monday with leaders and experts calling on the government to take urgent action to tackle the issue of the rapidly growing populace, which adversely impacts the country’s economy and other sectors.
Organised by DawnMedia, the two-day summit brings toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as the rising population continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.
The second and final day of the summit, taking place in Islamabad, is set to begin at 9:30am tomorrow. Federal and provincial leaders, alongside urban and policy experts, will share their perspectives as they contribute to the national conversation.

 

View the full agenda here.
Pakistan, with a population of over 241 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, adding four to five million people every year. Its population growth rate of 2.40 per cent is the highest in South Asia.
The rapid increase is outpacing employment opportunities, with official statistics showing the country will require 104m jobs by 2040. Pakistan will not be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 if the current trajectory of population growth does not slow down.

5:45pm — Day 1 concludes
Day 1 of the Pakistan Population Summit has concluded. Thank you for tuning in to today’s meaningful discussions aimed at creating awareness about the national-level issue of a rapidly growing population.




5:33pm — Cannot differentiate between population welfare, management and healthcare: Punjab official
Nadia Saquib, secretary of Punjab’s Health & Population Department, said the current provincial government realised that “you cannot differentiate between population welfare, population control and healthcare”.
She underscored the importance of increasing the coverage of primary healthcare services. Saquib noted there were various problems, such as absenteeism, healthcare professionals’ non-availability, and disgruntled workers.
The Punjab secretary detailed that the government outsourced district hospitals and small clinics to doctors, and not entities or corporate players.
“Family planning, short-acting as well as long-acting, was integrated and made a part of the essential healthcare services that were measured and paid against,” Saquib said, adding that more than 2,000 basic health units had been operationalised.

5:24pm — Former AJK population secretary details his region’s efforts
Raja Muhammad Razzaque, the former secretary of Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s Population and Welfare Department, observed that while there were some success stories in his region, there were also certain challenges.
One of the “success stories”, according to him, was that the AJK government had recently merged the population and the health departments. Razzaque added that this move would improve the service delivery.
Pointing out that there was a women’s university and four medical colleges, the ex-secretary emphasised, “These are the things that are adding support to the cause of family planning and reproductive health. We can only succeed in achieving the targets with better education.”

5:16pm — Ex-GB lawmaker notes ‘contradiction’ of population’s importance in NFC award
Former Gilgit-Baltistan lawmaker Javaid Ali Manwa noted that the population segment contributed 82.5pc to the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, while inverse population density made up 2.5pc.
He said these imbalances needed to be addressed in order for a national framework on tackling the population crisis.
Manwa pointed out the “contradiction” that, on the one hand, there was a need to manage population growth, but on the other hand, that same factor was the main contributor to how many resources a region gets.

5:10pm — KP official details efforts made despite terrorism situation, ‘traditional society’
Dr Aneela Mehfooz Durrani, secretary of the KP Population Welfare Department, noted the province’s “traditional society” and acknowledged there were situations where family planning was considered taboo.
Durrani asserted that despite the terrorism situation, the KP government had tried to expand the service delivery.
“We have established 260 welfare centres in the settled districts and about 120 additional centres are being established in the merged districts.”
The KP official further pointed out that women in the province were not empowered enough to make decisions about family planning.

5:05pm — Birth spacing is the most important thing: Punjab health minister
Punjab Health and Population Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir stressed the need for “family planning”, adding that he was not in favour of “stopping the population”.
“Birth spacing is the most important thing,” Nazir said, emphasising that women’s health needed to be kept in mind.

4:58pm — ‘Sindh govt aims to rejuvenate Lady Health Workers programme’
Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho stated that Sindh has ample stocks of contraceptives for at least a year. However, she noted that sourcing stocks from India, specifically long-acting contraceptives, has been difficult due to worsening relations between Islamabad and New Delhi.
“All commodities should be manufactured [locally] so we save on dollars and costs and ensure no stockouts,” she stated.
The minister added that community health workers would be hired on a contractual basis to rejuvenate the Lady Health Workers programme and direct it towards family planning.

 

“Obviously, they have a lot on their plate … so it becomes very cumbersome on them and we need to increase this workforce,” she said. “Unfortunately, because they were regular employees, our financials didn’t allow us to increase the workforce.”

4:50pm — Dr Azra Pechuho says Centre must ‘do a lot’ on funding population welfare
Sindh Minister for Health and Population Welfare Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, in her address via video link, noted that family planning has been adversely affected after devolution.
“My contention is that because implementation is with provinces … it was sensible to devolve family planning and the population welfare department down to the provinces,” she said.
“The federal government has to do a lot … [the court] directed that Rs10bn be given to the provinces just for family planning and population welfare services. Unfortunately, that money did not come through.”

4:42pm — Population still very low in govt’s list of priorities: Dr Malik Mukhtar
Recalling his experience as Punjab’s population minister under then-chief minister Shehbaz Sharif, Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed said, “I think things haven’t changed […] as they had to be. […] I still think that population is very low in the priority list of the government.”
He said the segregation of the lady health workers programme and the population ministry was the “worst thing” that happened to the family planning programme.
Dr Ahmed praised the current Punjab government for merging the population and the primary health departments.
“We are only addressing 60 per cent of the population of Punjab. Forty per cent of the urban population is still being neglected because of the absence of the Lady Health Workers programme in the towns and cities.”

4:32pm — Maleeha Lodhi voices concern about stagnant literacy levels
Dr Lodhi stated that the deficit in human development rarely comes up in parliamentary debate, and the broader picture remains grim.
She brought up the UN Development Programme’s latest Human Development Report from this year, which ranked Pakistan 168 out of 198 countries.


Maleeha Lodhi speaks at the summit. — Mohammad Asim/White Star

Discussing specific areas, Dr Lodhi said, “Literacy levels, as you know, are stagnant. Official documents put literacy at 60 per cent … this means 40pc of our people are still illiterate.
“No country has achieved economic progress with this level of illiteracy,” she emphasised.

 

She further warned that if the youth remain uneducated and unemployed, they face a “hopeless future” which could jeopardise the country’s prospects and trajectory.

4:21pm — Population management not a priority for govt: Maleeha Lodhi
Dr Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former permanent representative to the United Nations, highlighted that population management is not a priority for the government.
“I understand the prime minister was supposed to come in the morning to deliver his address and he didn’t show up,” she said. “That is how important population is to the prime minister, the government and successive governments,” she quipped.
Dr Lodhi warned that uncontrolled population growth would feed into Pakistan’s human development crisis, which “has far-reaching consequences for our economic development and the welfare of our people”.
“The crisis in human development is reflected by the fact that almost all indicators — literacy, education, health, poverty, gender disparity … have been deteriorating in recent years,” she added.
“The country’s growth and development prospects are being severely constrained by the lack of investment in human capital,” the former diplomat noted. “Policy action to address this doesn’t really figure in government priorities.”

4:18pm —‘GDP growth rate, household savings to rise if population growth rate declines by 2030’
Raza Rabbani said the GDP growth rate could be 1.7 percentage points higher if the population growth rate declines by 2030.
He further said the per capita income per annum could double by 2050 if the population growth rate declines by 2030, and the per capita income will rise at 3.4pc per year instead of 2.2pc.
Household savings will go up to 13.4pc with a lower population growth rate. Investment rates will be 6.5 percentage points if the population growth rate declines by 2030.

4:15pm — Raza Rabbani calls for focus on ‘real issues’ rather than political ones
Veteran politician Raza Rabbani said, “As a state, we must focus on development and let settled issues remain — ie there should be no more constitutional amendments, no further provinces, no change in the parliamentary system of governance and the adherence to provincial autonomies”.
He lamented that most of the time was spent “getting caught up on these rather than looking at the real issues”.
Rabbani also said that the “bulk of the budget” being spent on defence and debt servicing was a matter that the country will “need to work around”.
He noted the lack of inclusion of young people in policymaking, with restrictive rules in youth parliaments and bureaucratic barriers leaving “many feeling excluded”.
“The failure of the state to provide a Pakistan-oriented educational system drives the youth towards religious and nationalistic extremism,” the politician said.

4:10pm — Raza Rabbani lists grim statistics
Raza Rabbani cautioned that if the huge youth population was not managed, it may “turn into our greatest vulnerability”.

 

He stated that the youth ratio had risen from 19pc in the 1951 census to 26pc in 2023. While youth literacy was around 72-75pc, certified vocational skills remained limited, he added.
He termed the rising unemployment, skill gaps, and lack of opportunities for women, among other factors, as “key sources of distress”.

4:05pm — Situation warrants ‘urgent corrective action at all levels of state and society’: Raza Rabbani
Former PPP senator Raza Rabbani is speaking at the sixth and the second-last session of the day, titled “The Human Development Crisis”.
“The situation warrants urgent corrective action at all levels of state and society,” he asserted.
“Pakistan must lose no further time in joining the countries of the region and the Muslim world in achieving a rate of population growth that is sustainable,” the senior politician said.
He recalled that a national task force constituted by the Supreme Court had identified 33 specific recommendations, which had been approved by the Council of Common Interests.




3:51pm — Professor Mehtab S. Karim highlights Bangladesh’s ‘miracle’
Professor Mehtab S. Karim said Bangladesh achieved the “miracle” of increasing its real per capita income by restricting population growth.
He also noted that Bangladesh’s mortality rate had declined from 10-11pc to 2pc, while the life expectancy had also increased by 15 years compared to three years in Pakistan during the last 37 years.

3:40pm — Population Association of Pakistan president says govts ‘not serious enough’
Population Association of Pakistan President Professor Mehtab S. Karim said that none of the “successive governments after Gen Ayub Khan’s removal” were serious enough about population programming in Pakistan, except for ex-PM Benazir Bhutto.
Prof Karim also brought up Bangladesh as a case study, pointing out the rising contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) there, leading to the average number of children per woman of two, compared to Pakistan “still struggling” with over three children per woman.

3:27pm — Indonesian envoy details his country’s efforts
Rahmat Hindiarta Kusuma, social affairs coordinator at the Indonesian embassy, noted that Indonesia had ranked among the top six most populous countries since the 1960s.
“However, the international community has considered Indonesia as one of the countries having a strong and successful family planning initiatives in the world,” Kusuma highlighted.
He cited figures of declining fertility rate in Indonesia and rising CPR in the 1990s.
“The crisis gave us very incredible experience,” he said, adding that people learned that having family planning was beneficial for them.
Kusuma recalled that Indonesia organised dialogues and events to promote the importance of family planning, with enforcement encouraged among men as well, not just women.

3:23pm — ‘Should include chapter on small families in academic curriculum’
Dr Rashid Amjad said there was much to learn from Bangladesh, which had got “some tailwinds” of the youth dividend.
He also mentioned the “flexibility” that Iran and Egypt were trying to build into their population growth strategy. “Egypt is very similar to us […] [President] Sisi is very clear — two-child family,” he said.
Dr Amjad underscored the need to educate the youth about the benefits of “happy, healthy, smaller families”, calling for the topic to be incorporated into primary and higher education curricula.
He also suggested the formation of a high-level “Special Demographic Dividend Facilitation Council”.

3:18pm — Pakistan facing ‘demographic disaster’ with rising fertility rate: Dr Amjad
Dr Rashid Amjad described “demographic dividend” as a “window of opportunity which comes up when your working age population grows at a faster rate than your dependent population”.
“We did not receive the demographic dividend. We are in the phase of what I call the demographic disaster,” he said.
The Lahore School of Economics professor described the demographic disaster as a situation when you get a youth bulge and “there is an echo of this youth bulge in terms of increasing fertility”.
“So you get what we call double jeopardy.”
He emphasised the importance of having the “tailwind” of declining population growth alongside reforms, such as in the case of India.

3:15pm — Academic says exact census figures not known
Dr Rashid Amjad, director of Lahore School of Economics’ Graduate Institute of Development Studies, said the exact population figures were not known.
“Unless we get our numbers right, unless we allow our population census, allow other bodies to do their homework in the way they do it by adding numbers, we will not make any progress.”

3pm — UNFPA’s Dr Luay Shabaneh speaks as 5th session begins
Dr Luay Shabaneh, representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Pakistan, is chairing today’s fifth session, titled “Regional Review of Population & Economic Growth”.
“We don’t have a vision [of] what Pakistan is trying to achieve on this agenda, apart from blaming people for being victims,” the UNFPA official said.
He stated that the number of people was not the entire issue, but the main challenges were the human capital and the outcomes of the health and education systems.

2: 12pm — Farooq Sattar sees something ‘seriously wrong’ with approach to conducting population census
MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said that there was something “seriously wrong” about the approach taken to conducting the population census. He said that the last census held in 2023, due to enhanced monitoring, authorities were able to catch the “thieves snatching away a big chunk of Karachi’s population”.
He further said that Karachi’s population had risen from 32pc to 37pc of Sindh’s over the last 60 years.
He further said that while other speakers had highlighted the impact of unchecked demographic growth, very few had talked about the influx due to economic migration.

2:05pm — Jhagra calls for revising NFC to ‘fiscal equalisation’
Jhagra stressed the need for increasing the size of the NFC award, basing it on the principle of “fiscal equalisation”.
The former minister said: “Change the NFC, change it from population, but that does not necessarily mean that more backward provinces get less because if you look at any definition of an instrument, such as the NFC, its primary object is fiscal equalisation.”

 

He continued: “Sindh can generate revenue from the port, and Punjab can generate revenue because it’s the agricultural hub and breadbasket of Pakistan. Balochistan is a massive challenge, and in KP, the two competitive advantages that we have are trade with Afghanistan, which is now closed, and two, we can be the energy hub of the country.”
However, Jhagra lamented that KP remained isolated, saying “for us to develop our economy in the way we can, the state of Pakistan does not allow us and tells us it’s in the national interest”.
Citing India’s example of the NFC distribution, Jhagra said, “States in India that are the furthest behind in revenue generation get the greatest share because of this need for fiscal equalisation.”

1:58pm — PTI’s Taimur Jhagra calls for integrating family planning with health sector
Former KP minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra called for the need to integrate family planning into the health sector.
Recalling his time as the provincial health minister, the PTI leader said, “I told my staff that every Basic Health Unit (BHU) and primary health care centre must, in its set key metrics, have family planning as one of them.”
The former minister stressed that “by bifurcating family planning from health, we have actually created this need to buy new land for new family planning centres, to recruit more staff when all the staff exists within the health set-up.”
Recalling a federal government’s family planning meeting, he said that “out of Rs10bn set up for family planning, we were told that Rs9bn would be spent on arranging land for the family planning centres”.

1:54pm — PM has taken up challenge to tackle massive population growth: MNA Shaista Pervaiz
Asked about the three actions that the current government led by her party should be doing to promote population as the paramount issue for Pakistan, PML-N MNA Shaista Pervaiz noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has “recognised and taken up the challenge”.
“The priority should be [that it’s] taken at the national level, with chief ministers of the provinces taken into it together,” she said, noting that the lack of coordination between the Centre and the provinces was clearly evident.
The PML-N lawmaker emphasised the need to take the people along with what is decided at the top level. She added that the Centre and the provinces were working in silos, with each taking its own decisions.
“The [subject] of population needs to come under the federal umbrella,” Pervaiz added.

1:50pm — Pakistan being ‘Muslim country’ not an impediment to tackling population growth
Mushahid Hussain termed it a myth that Pakistan being a Muslim country was an impediment in tackling high population growth.
The senator pointed out that the Muslim-majority countries of Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh were “success stories in population”.
“The government priorities are wrong,” PML-N’s Mushahid said, emphasising that funds were being allocated to other areas when much of it could be spent on education.

1:48pm — Lack of political will, lack of priorities are issues: ex-senator Mushahid Hussain
Former senator Mushahid highlighted that now, all major political parties had a focus on the subject of population.
He recalled that he also spoke to the military when he was the chairman of the Senate’s standing committee on defence.
“That time onwards, even the speeches of the military focused on population as a part of the narrative on Pakistan,” Mushahid said.
He pointed out that “lack of political will and lack of priorities” were the problems in tackling the issue.

1:45pm — Former senator Mushahid notes ‘politics of population’ in Pakistan
Mushahid Hussain noted that there was “politics of population” in Pakistan, with people saying that the population has been understated after every census.
He noted that constitutionally, the allocation of resources to the provinces was based largely on population.
The PPP senator recalled that he introduced a resolution in the Senate on population in 2020, which had the support of all parties. He also pointed out the launch of “Parliamentary Forum on Population”, calling it his brainchild.

Former senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed is moderating the panel discussion.




1:28pm — World Bank official warns of ‘demographic liability’ if youth not provided with jobs, skills
The World Bank’s Pakistan director said reducing stunting and learning poverty were among the areas that would be focused on under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework.
Dr Bolormaa Amgaabazar noted that 60pc of Pakistan’s population was under 30, adding that there was a “potential” for demographic dividend, but it would remain unrealised until people were provided jobs and skills.
“Until then, it can turn into demographic liability,” she cautioned.

1:20pm — Population growth a ‘barrier to human and economic development’: World Bank official
Dr Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank’s country director for Pakistan, observed that population growth was a “barrier to human and economic development”.
Citing World Bank figures, she said a woman in Pakistan had 3.6 children on average, adding that it was higher than the rest of South Asia.
While noting that there was a difference in these statistics, with the Bank’s being higher, Amgaabazar asserted that they depicted the same thing — Pakistan’s fertility rate was much higher than other neighbouring countries.
Echoing Sherry Rehman and Aurangzeb’s comments, she noted that rapid growth was linked to climate change, water scarcity and food security.

1:05pm — Dr S. Akbar Zaidi points out ‘extremely worrying’ trends in declining real wage, HDI
Dr S. Akbar Zaidi further noted that unemployment had been growing in the last five to seven years.
Citing economist Dr Hafeez Pasha’s data, he said the real wage of workers in Pakistan has seen a 20pc in just the last three years.
He also mentioned Pakistan’s declining ranking in the UN Human Development Index, terming the figures “extremely worrying trends”.
Speaking about human capital, Dr Zaidi said, “Today, we are half a century behind where South Korea is.”
In contrast to the finance minister’s remarks, Dr Zaidi said, “We can’t talk about a new economy, of IT, of computer growth with these sort of numbers.”

12:55pm — Pakistan’s economy in a very, very sharp decline: Dr S. Akbar Zaidi
“Pakistan is in decline. Pakistan’s economy is in a very, very sharp decline,” said IBA Executive Director Dr S. Akbar Zaidi at the outset of his comments.
“You talk to any economist and the many in this room and most will agree that all numbers are going in the wrong direction,” he added.
“It is irrefutable that Pakistan’s economy is not doing well, in relevant terms and in absolute terms, it is much worse than it has been over the last few years.”
Dr Zaidi said that Pakistan was estimated to be the third most populous country in the world in 25 years.

12:50pm — Lums VC Ali Cheema for ‘centring women’ in tackling population growth
Taking to the stage, Lahore University of Management Sciences’ Vice Chancellor Ali Cheema underscored the importance of centring women in solutions aimed at population growth.
“Both in terms of growth and fertility decline, if you do not centre women, you are not gonna get growth up, and you are not going to get fertility down,” Cheema said.
He further noted: “Don’t think about population as a separate service to be provided under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), but [rather] we want to centre that (population) as part of growth, if you do not bring population down, you are not gonna get growth up.”

12:44pm — Youth leading IT economy, says Aurangzeb
Addressing the issue of the population dividend, the finance minister noted that the youth were “leading the IT economy” in the country and called for the need to get out of the “job mindset”.

 

“This is not about the government giving jobs, I think we have to get out of that mindset, it is the ladies and gentlemen who are freelancers today, leading our IT services, leading the IT economy.
“We need to upskill them, reskill them; that is how we are going to go forward with respect to this population dividend,” he detailed.

12:40pm — We must move to ‘implementation’, says Aurangzeb
Continuing his address, the finance minister noted that “we have known the what and why for the longest time” behind population growth.
Aurangzeb, who has repeatedly termed population growth as an “existential issue” for Pakistan, said, “There is no dearth of policy prescriptions.
“Everything has to do now with the […] execution and the how part of it.”

12:30pm — Aurangzeb stresses need to ‘recognise and negotiate’ population growth, climate change
The finance minister called for the need to “recognise and negotiate” population growth and climate change.
Speaking about Pakistan’s roadmap to a $3 trillion economy by 2047, Aurangzeb stressed that it was “clear that these two existential issues have to be recognised and negotiated if we are to realise our full potential”.

12:25pm — Third session begins with finance minister’s remarks
The third session of the day, titled ‘Accelerating Economic Growth Towards a More Optimal Balance’, has begun. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is voicing his opinions on the issue.




12:10pm — ‘Pakistan’s capital-labour ratio much lower than India’
Dr Hanid Mukhtar further noted that because of the low investment, which was indirectly related to the population growth, Pakistan’s “capital-labour ratio is much much lower than India”.
He stressed that it was important because it was a factor that provided productivity to labourers.

12:03pm — Dr Hanid Mukhtar highlights rising imbalance compared to rest of South Asia
Dr Hanid Mukhtar, a fellow at the Consortium for Development Policy Research, pointed out that Pakistan’s GDP per capita income had been growing at 3.6pc per year.
However, he then compared that the per capita income was 56pc higher than that of India in 1990 and almost double that of Bangladesh, but in 2024, India had 71pc higher GDP per capita than Pakistan and Bangladesh’s was 53pc higher.
Dr Mukhtar said that research had shown that the population impacted GDP growth.
He also spoke about expenditure, warning: “Even if we don’t see too much difference in public infrastructure quality and quantity between India and Pakistan today. Watch out; next five years, they are going to [leave all us behind] like anything.”

11:52am — 6m ‘unwanted pregnancies’ reported in Pakistan every year: Dr Sathar
Detailing the results of a research, Dr Sathar shared that out of a total of 12.7m pregnancies recorded in Pakistan, six million were “unwanted or untimed”.
“If we had strong family planning programs, we could remove or rather reduce, the unwanted pregnancies and focus on the other 6.7m instead, ensuring a better mortality rate,” she said.
“This is what women want, this is what families want,” Dr Sathar added, expressing confidence that Pakistani families would react positively to a good and well-funded family planning program.

11:50am — Dr Sathar sounds alarm on out-of-school children
On the number of out-of-school children, Dr Sathar termed it an “unacceptable figure”.
She said the figures were not huge because of parents not wanting to send their children to school, but it was a “failure” of the governments.
“I don’t want to point to any particular government; all the past few governments.”




11:40am — Dr Zeba Sathar calls for restoring balance to address population growth
Dr Zeba Sathar, the country director for Pakistan at Population Council, opened the second session, explaining the summit’s theme on “balance” in addressing population growth.
“We have centred our whole theme around balance because it is important to have a national narrative,” Sathar said.
“The balance really is about responsibility, the state’s responsibility; the balance has to be restored in terms of societal issues, the balance between resources, and the number of people in Pakistan,” she said.
Comparing Pakistan’s population growth with other countries in South Asia, she noted that “We are clearly out of balance in terms of where we are standing with our neighbours.”
“Our growth rate is double that of our neighbours,” she added.

11:38am — Govt has placed ‘stunting, population management at highest national priority’
Speaking further, the planning minister highlighted that PM Shehbaz has placed “stunting and population management at the highest national priority”.
“The government is moving towards emergency multi-sector action integrating health, nutrition, education, social protection, water and local government systems,” Ahsan Iqbal said.
“It is not population size but population quality that drives national progress.”
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s priority must be fewer children but better outcomes for every child.

11:35am — Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal highlights child stunting
Addressing the summit via video link, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed child stunting one of the most painful demographic challenges.
“Countries with high stunting lose 2-3pc of GDP annually. Due to no productivity and impaired human capital, a stunted child earns up to 22pc less over their lifetime,” Iqbal said.
He added, “This is not a health issue alone. It is a national productivity crisis, a national development emergency, and a direct threat to Pakistan’s long-term economic strength and sustainability.”
“I commend DawnMedia group, the Population Council and all our development partners for convening a dialogue on an issue that will shape Pakistan’s destiny more than any other.”
Citing the estimated figure of 370m by 2050, Iqbal termed population growth a “defining challenge for our future stability, prosperity and competitiveness”.
“Every single year, Pakistan adds almost the entire population of New Zealand, around 4-4.5m people,” the minister noted.

11:30am — No more a demographic issue: Shaista Pervaiz
MNA Shaista Pervaiz began her address by commending the participants, lauding their “collective resolve to address population challenges”.
She stressed that “population growth is no more a demographic issue”.
She continued: “It is linked with our economy, it is linked with the well-being of our people, linked with the future of our children, linked with everything a country is judged by.”
Pervaiz noted that while there was “political will” present to address the issue, it was time that it should be “turned into action”.

11:26am — ‘No new ministry needed; have information ministry do awareness drive’
Providing suggestios on how to tackle the issue, Sherry Rehman said the federal government should have the information minister hold an awareness drive in the national language on population and family planning.
“It doesn’t need to worry about having a population ministry. Please don’t have ministries. Please don’t,” the senator said.
“Start putting this on phones, on Androids, on anything. And you will have yourself a campaign that goes into your doors.”

11:14am — There is demand for the ‘C-word, for contraception’: Sherry Rehman
Sherry Rehman stressed, “There is demand for the C-word, for contraception. Contraception prevalence rate (CPR) is what you need to talk about.”

 

Noting that the CPR was 34pc, she emphasised that contraceptive usage would lower the birth rate and said there was a need for it to be easily and cheaply accessible.
“One province is offering vasectomies to men who are willing to take it up,” she remarked.
“Every 50 minutes, before we finish this session, a woman in Pakistan will die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications.”
The senator noted the Council of Islamic Ideology’s ruling allowing birth spacing and said the hesitation was not a religious matter, but rather a cultural taboo.
Noting the high unemployment rate, Rehman said it raised “discontent in the state’s ability to provide a climate where employment is easily available”.

11:05am — ‘72pc of a woman’s day spent carrying water’
Sherry Rehman also pointed out the excessive water consumption, calling for the need to reduce it. She termed large-storage dams “a thing of the past”, noting the lack of financing for them and the displacement caused by them.
“Seventy-two per cent, three quarters, of the average woman’s day in Pakistan is taken up carrying water. Shocking, isn’t it?” the senator highlighted.
“Food, climate and poverty are all impacted,” Rehman, also the chairperson of the Parliamentary Forum on Population, said.
“Forty per cent of children under five are stunted,” she added, noting that mothers were also not able to make the health choices that they need to, including birth spaces.

11:03am — Population numbers amplify climate shocks: Sherry Rehman
Speaking about the intersection of climate change and population growth, Senator Rehman said, “With our economic growth dragged down by climate shocks and institutional fragility — let’s not pretend that is not the case —we are not able to lift millions out of the poverty I just spoke about.”
She detailed that if the GDP was already being impacted by multiple factors, such as the recent floods, “population numbers stretch those numbers further”.
“There are simply more people to save, more people to shelter, more people to feed, house, clothe, and save from diseases.”

11:00am — ‘Population growth has passed some kind of danger line’
Referring to Nazafreen’s comments on Pakistan’s “youth bulge”, Senator Sherry Rehman said, “Pakistan talks about this demographic dividend non-stop, but at which point does this dividend become a challenge?
“When you are not able to provide jobs for the 1.5m jobs needed per year,” she said, stressing that “it was a huge number”.
“Population growth, in my view, and I am sure everyone agrees, has passed some kind of danger line,” Rehman cautioned.
“Of course, we love people, we love our births, and we mourn our deaths, but what goes round here is the pressure on our resources,” the senator explained.




10:55am — Sherry Rehman terms population growth a ‘ticking time bomb’ for Pakistan
In a keynote address, Senator Sherry Rehman recalled: “Seven years ago, I wrote about three ticking time bombs for Pakistan — unchecked population growth was one of them, water scarcity, and of course, climate stress.”
“In my view, they are no longer ticking; they have noiselessly exploded around us,” the minister warned.
“They have already done the damage they needed to do,” she said.

10:45am — ‘Let’s work together to defuse population time bomb, turn it into Pakistan’s greatest dividend’
Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani said the provision of education up to at least Grade 12 and upskilling the youth through vocational training would not only strengthen Pakistan’s GDP but also position “our human capital to support other economies facing a population explosion”.
“This young skilled workforce has the potential to transform Pakistan’s destiny, to build real economic strength and to elevate our standing on the global stage.
“The decisions we take today on health, education, gender, equity and economic development are investments in Pakistan’s future,” she highlighted.
“We will bring you ideas, detailed reporting, expert analysis and focused storytelling, so that the conversations here reach people across the country and help shape a more informed national debate,” she added.
“Let us work together to defuse this population time bomb and turn it into Pakistan’s greatest dividend,” she said.

10:42am — ‘Rapid growth slows our ability to improve living standards’
Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani noted that “without careful planning, rapid growth weakens per capita income and slows our ability to improve living standards”.
“Globally, the contrast is stark,” she said, pointing out that many Asian countries had slowed population growth through education, women’s empowerment and access to health services.
“Pakistan’s fast growth without parallel investment in human development makes it harder to deliver basic services and harder for families to move out of poverty.”
The Dawn CEO, however, said there was an opportunity for Pakistan, which was at a crossroads with a “large and growing population, a sizeable youth cohort and rapidly evolving socio-economic realities”.

10:38am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen highlights Pakistan has ‘young’ population
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, highlighted that Pakistan had a mostly young population, with the “median age of just over 20 years”.
Stating some estimates about the expected population in the coming years, she said the rapid growth directly affects the lives of people and the country’s future.
The Dawn CEO said: “It places immense pressure on our health care system, especially maternal and child health. It stretches our education system, leaving millions of children without access to quality learning. It increases the demand for jobs, housing, clean water, sanitation, transport and for energy.

Separate weather systems brought torrential, extended rainfall to the entire island of Sri Lanka and large parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia last week.
Much of the region is currently in its monsoon season but climate change is producing more extreme rain events and turbocharging storms.
The relentless rains left residents clinging to rooftops awaiting rescue by boat or helicopter, and cut entire villages off from assistance.

Arriving in North Sumatra on Monday, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said, “the worst has passed, hopefully”.
The government’s “priority now is how to immediately send the necessary aid”, with particular focus on several cut-off areas, he added.
Prabowo is under increasing pressure to declare a national emergency in response to flooding and landslides that have killed at least 593 people, with nearly 470 still missing.
Unlike his Sri Lankan counterpart, Prabowo has also avoided publicly calling for international assistance.
The toll is the deadliest in a natural disaster in Indonesia since a massive 2018 earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed more than 2,000 people in Sulawesi.
The government has sent three warships carrying aid and two hospital ships to some of the worst-hit areas, where many roads remain impassable.
In North Aceh, 28-year-old Misbahul Munir described walking through water that reached his neck to get back to his parents.
“Everything in the house was destroyed because it was submerged,” he told AFP.
“I have only the clothes I am wearing,” he said in tears.
“In other places, there were a lot of people who died. We are grateful that we are healthy.”
‘Everything went under’
In Sri Lanka, the government called for international aid and used military helicopters to reach people stranded by flooding and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah.

At least 355 people have been killed, Sri Lankan officials said on Monday, with another 366 still missing.
Floodwaters in the capital Colombo peaked overnight.
Now that the rain has stopped, there is hope that the waters will begin receding. Some shops and offices have reopened.
The floodwaters came as a surprise to some around Colombo.
“Every year we experience minor floods, but this is something else,” delivery driver Dinusha Sanjaya, 37, told AFP.
“It is not just the amount of water, but how quickly everything went under.” Officials said the extent of the damage in the worst-affected central region was only just being revealed as relief workers cleared roads blocked by fallen trees and mudslides.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who declared a state of emergency to deal with the disaster, called the flooding the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history.” The losses and damage are the worst in Sri Lanka since the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami that killed around 31,000 people there and left more than a million homeless.
Anger in Thailand
By Sunday afternoon, rain had subsided across Sri Lanka but low-lying areas of the capital were flooded and authorities were bracing for a major relief operation.
Military helicopters have been deployed to airlift stranded residents and to deliver food. One crashed just north of Colombo on Sunday, killing the pilot.
The annual monsoon season often brings heavy rain, triggering landslides and flash floods.
But the flooding that hit Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia was also exacerbated by a rare tropical storm that dumped heavy rain on Sumatra island in particular.
The waves of rain caused flooding that killed at least 176 people in southern Thailand, authorities said Monday, one of the deadliest flood incidents in the country in a decade.
The government has rolled out relief measures, but there has been growing public criticism of the flood response, and two local officials have been suspended over their alleged failures.
Across the border in Malaysia, where heavy rains also inundated large stretches of land in Perlis state, two people were killed.</p><small>2025-12-01 13:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/011745448e97dbb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958545/inflation-edges-down-to-61pc-in-november' target='_blank'><strong>Inflation edges down to 6.1pc in November</strong></a><br><p>Inflation edged lower in November to 6.1 per cent, official data showed on Monday, easing slightly after a jump last month and staying within the finance ministry’s projected range.
Food items and energy spiked the inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), to 6.24 per cent in October against 5.6pc in September, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported in early November.
According to a report published by PBS today, general inflation was just a touch lower than October’s figures, increasing by 6.1pc on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, inflation stood at 0.4pc after a 1.8pc jump in October.
“SPI inflation on [a] YoY basis increased by 4.2pc in November 2025, as compared to an increase of 4.8pc a month earlier and an increase of 7.3pc in November 2024,” the report read.
“On [a] MoM basis, it increased by 0.4pc in November 2025 as compared to 0.9pc a month earlier and an increase of 1pc in November 2024.”
Inflation has come down from nearly 30pc a year ago, though temporary supply shocks and earlier flood damage have kept food prices volatile.
The finance ministry last week said inflation was expected to remain in the 5-6pc band in November, citing better crop arrivals and moderating fuel costs.
The reading follows the State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to hold its key policy rate at 11pc, with the central bank saying inflation would stay above its 5-7pc target range for a few more months before easing next fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-01 13:11</small></div><hr>
