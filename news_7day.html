“More than a year ago, I declared a public health emergency of international concern over the spread of mpox in Africa on the advice of an emergency committee,” he said during a live press briefing.
“Yesterday, they met again and advised me that, in its view, the situation no longer represents an international health emergency. I have accepted that advice.”
Dr Ghebreyesus said that the decision was based on sustained declines in cases and deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Uganda, among other affected nations.

“Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!” Trump wrote in a social media post accompanying a photo of the three other world leaders together at Xi’s summit in China.
Asked about Trump’s post, the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters in New Delhi that he had no comment.
Representatives for Beijing and Moscow could not be immediately reached for comment on Trump’s post on his Truth Social platform.
Xi hosted more than 20 leaders of non-Western countries for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Putin and Modi were seen holding hands at the summit as they walked toward Xi before all three men stood side by side.
Modi’s warming ties with China come as Trump has chilled US-India ties amid trade tensions and other disputes. Trump earlier this week said he was ”very disappointed” in Putin but not worried about growing Russia-China ties.
India plans relief package for exporters hit by US tariffs
Separately, India will roll out a package of measures to help exporters hurt by a surge in US tariffs, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said today.
The new US duties slapped on Indian goods last month included a 25 per cent punitive levy over New Delhi’s Russian oil purchases — taking overall duties as high as 50pc on a wide range of items from garments and jewellery to footwear and chemicals.
“Government will come out with something to handhold those who have been hit by 50pc tariffs,” Sitharaman told CNBC TV18, without going into further detail.
The government plans to offer credit guarantees on loans overdue by up to 90 days for small businesses and exporters, Reuters reported earlier, citing government sources.
Exporters said labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, jewellery and seafood, particularly shrimp, which all operate on margins of just 3-5pc — have been hit hardest, causing job losses in industrial hubs in Tamil Nadu and Modi’s home state of Gujarat.
“Textiles and apparel manufacturers in Tiruppur, Noida and Surat have halted production amid worsening cost competitiveness,” SC Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said.
The tariffs, among the highest imposed by the Trump administration, delivered a serious blow to ties between the two powerful democracies that had in recent decades become strategic partners.
Nearly 55pc of Indian exports to the US, worth about $48 billion, now face a cost disadvantage against rivals from Vietnam, China and Bangladesh, Ralhan said last week ahead of an exporters’ meeting with the finance minister.
Thousands of workers have already been laid off, exporters have said.
Sitharaman also said that India would continue to buy Russian oil as it proves economical
New Delhi has said its purchases of Russian oil have kept the markets in balance.
“We will have to take a call [on] which [supply source] suits us the best. So we will undoubtedly be buying it,” the finance minister said, adding that India spends most of its foreign exchange on purchases of crude oil and refined fuels.
“Whether it is Russian oil or anything else, it’s our decision to buy from the place which suits our needs whether in terms of rates, logistics, anything,” Sitharaman added.</p><small>2025-09-05 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05144654f72cc85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939910/two-women-held-for-hurling-egg-at-imran-khans-sister-aleema-in-rawalpindi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two women held for hurling egg at Imran Khan’s sister Aleema in Rawalpindi: police</strong></a><br><p>The police said two women were arrested on Friday for throwing an egg at PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum during a media talk in Rawalpindi outside the Adiala Jail, where a hearing of the Toshakhana case was held earlier.
Footage of the incident was widely shared on different news channels and social media accounts, capturing the expression of shock on Aleema’s face when the egg was hurled at her.
A statement released by the Rawalpindi Police said that the two arrested suspects were PTI supporters, who had travelled to Rawalpindi with other members of the All Government Employees Grand Alliance and the All Pakistan Clerks Association to protest for their unmet demands.
“The egging took place when Aleema Khan did not answer the questions raised by the two women,” the statement said. “They have been taken into police custody and sent to the Adiala checkpoint.”

The police added that immediately after throwing the egg, the two women tried to run away in their car. “However, their vehicle was surrounded by PTI supporters, some of whom also hurled pebbles at the car and broke the windscreen.”
Later, the PTI reposted a video of a white car on X, dubbing the incident a “shameful attack on Aleema Khan”.
In a statement posted in a preceding post, the party said PTI workers chased the women right after they hurled an egg at Aleema Khan but police “facilitated them in escaping along with a car as part of a plan”.
The statement also claimed that the women were sent to the media talk “as part of an agenda”. The party further stated that they had the registration number of the car seen in the video. It also demanded the registration of a first information report of the “attack on Aleema Khan”.
 






The car in question appears to be a Honda BR-V, with Honda’s logo clearly visible. The number plate on the vehicle shows the registration number BJS-608.
However, when Dawn.com searched for it in public records, the results showed that the registration number was of a Suzuki Alto on the Sindh Excise Department’s website.

Aleema has been campaigning for her brother’s release since August 2024.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In November 2014, a plot to attack Imran with rotten eggs and tomatoes was foiled in Gujranwala. Earlier that day, TV channels had reported that angry PML-N activists were purchasing and gathering rotten eggs, tomatoes and shoes to hurl at the PTI founder.
The eggs and tomatoes were shown covered with the slogan ‘Ro Imran Ro’ (Cry Imran Cry). When the news had aired, local police took action and arrested four PML-N activists who confessed that they had planned to target Imran on Nowshera Road.</p><small>2025-09-05 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05153539ce4435c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939917/psx-crosses-154000-points-amid-investor-optimism-despite-flood-related-risks' target='_blank'><strong>PSX crosses 154,000 points amid investor optimism despite flood-related risks</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange on Friday breached the 154,000-point barrier in intraday trade amid continued investor optimism.
The KSE-100 index climbed 1,615.05 (1.06 per cent) to stand at 154,280.77 from the last close of 152,665.72 at 3:24pm. The market had opened on a positive note, gaining over 1,000 points by 11am.
Finally, the index closed at 154,277.19, with a gain of 1,611.47 points (1.06pc) compared to the previous session.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “Investors remain optimistic amid improving macroeconomic conditions, particularly the strengthening of the rupee.
“In addition, limited returns in alternative avenues such as real estate, fixed income, commodities, and currency markets make equities a more attractive option,” he added.
The PSX has witnessed a bullish trend in recent days, despite concerns over risks to the economy due to the ongoing floods, with the Pakistan Business Forum estimating the losses to crops worth billions of rupees.
 
 

Today’s gains for a sixth consecutive day follow the government’s treasury bill auc­­tion, which raised Rs491bn against a Rs400bn target.
Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, noted: “The equity market presently reflects the optimism phase of the investment cycle, with selective areas exhibiting signs of incipient euphoria.
“While valuations have normalised relative to the deep undervaluation witnessed two years ago, they are no longer at the exceptionally attractive levels that prevailed during that period,” he added.
However, regarding the flood-related risks, he said: “Importantly, the market’s ability to look past the recent floods is a matter of concern, as it signals a potential underestimation of broader macroeconomic and social risks.”
 
 

While noting that valuations cannot be described as “stretched”, Farooq said they do not offer the margin of safety available earlier.
“For retail investors, this context calls for prudence. Rather than attempting to time near-term fluctuations, a more sustainable approach would be to allocate gradually through systematic investment in mutual funds or by building a diversified portfolio of businesses that are well understood,” he advised.
“The long-term trajectory of wealth creation in equities remains intact, but it requires discipline, patience, and an appreciation of underlying risks rather than speculative positioning.”</p><small>2025-09-05 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05144724828024a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939903/govt-pti-spar-in-national-assembly-over-federal-flood-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Govt, PTI spar in National Assembly over federal flood relief</strong></a><br><p>The federal government and the PTI were at loggerheads in the National Assembly on Friday as the latter claimed “not enough” was being done to provide relief to those affected by the recent floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and boycotted the session over the disqualification of its lawmakers.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc across the province. The provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed his dissatisfaction with the help provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to the flood-affected population of KP, particularly Buner — the worst-hit area in the province — stating that the authority “did not help as much as it should have”.
“I say at this forum that we will continue to be at odds with the NDMA,” Gohar said on the floor. “I said the day-before-yesterday that the NDMA only gave us a few supplies in Buner, while 236 people have been killed, 120 are injured, and 1,470 shops and 875 homes have been destroyed.”
 


Gohar was interrupted by Law and Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, terming the PTI leader’s complaint as “politics just for the sake of politics” and urging the party to focus on people’s issues.
The law minister explained that disaster response has three tiers.
“There is a district disaster management authority, which the province’s deputy commissioners run; then there is the provincial disaster management authority, which is also run by the province,” Tarar said.
“The NDMA centres around information sharing. I will provide a detailed explanation, but if the opposition asks questions for the sake of politics and then walks out, then I don’t know what assembly we are sitting in.”
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq termed it “highly regrettable” that PTI leaders complain of not being allowed to speak despite Gohar and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser having spoken on several occasions.
When Gohar began his speech, Sadiq offered to arrange a visit for the opposition to the NDMA’s head office.
Speaking later during the session, Tarar said that Rs1.3 billion had been released to the NDMA for flood relief and other activities.
“The nation needs to work together for flood relief,” the minister said on the floor of the National Assembly. “The federal government is working with provinces on relief operations.
The minister added that the NDMA releases alerts and has a mobile app.
“We recommend that those in affected areas download the app; 92 per cent of predictions are accurate,“ he said.
“Relief has a long way to go, so we ask that the nation stand with and help those affected by floods,” Tarar said.
Ready to sit and talk on Balochistan: Tallal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry expressed the federal government’s willingness to sit with Balochistan’s leadership and political representatives for talks on the issue of missing persons.
Stating that the government had zero tolerance for any issues about the matter, the minister said, “No institution wants to be blamed nor [wants] that any agency displace people outside of the law — this cannot happen.”
Chaudhry noted that a Balochistan National Party-Mengal rally in Quetta, where a suicide bombing took place earlier this week, took place without security clearance from the interior ministry.
He said political gatherings were soft targets for terrorists, which is why the government insisted that programmes of such type needed security clearance.
The state minister also said the government, himself and the district administration were in contact with the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, which is participating in an ongoing sit-in in Islamabad. However, he did not mention the group by name, nor who he was in contact with.
The group is protesting for the release of remanded group members, including chief convener Dr Mahrang Baloch.
 


He said women from Balochistan, calling them “our sisters and daughters”, were protesting in front of the Islamabad Press Club and the government was accused of ignoring them.
“This is not the case. They are our daughters, although they are protesting on a very important road and attempts are being made to provide them security and facilitate them  despite court orders and legislation about protests from this house.”
He said the government was trying to handle the situation legally, but “unfortunately, a lot of people are going to the protest for photo sessions.”
Chaudhry alleged that the protest was “held hostage by a few women and people who used it for their own personal point scoring”.
Despite that, he said that the government was open to talks and multiple people had contacted them, but the reason for no conclusion as of yet was “many demands that the government cannot fulfil”, adding that it could not release people on bail who were under trial in the courts.</p><small>2025-09-05 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05160502b13170f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939928/fo-spokesperson-says-future-of-refugees-up-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>FO spokesperson says future of refugees ‘up to Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday said that Pakistan will decide what to do with the refugees it is hosting, such as those from Afghanistan.
Last month, Pakistan started deporting up to 1 million documented Afghan refugees ahead of its deadline for them to leave, following the interior ministry’s July 31 announcement that Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
Addressing a press briefing today, Khan said, “Those Afghans waiting to travel to Germany should be deported promptly,” referring to 2,400 Afghan refugees who were promised refuge by Berlin, before its approach to migrants hardened under a new gov­­­ernment. Germany has since announced it is considering an appeal to take in 200 refugees.
“Germany should take in these refugees as soon as possible,” the spokesperson added. “Pakistani law will apply to those Afghans living here. We will decide what to do with refugees in Pakistan.”
Khan also referred to an August statement from the German foreign ministry on X, which said that Berlin takes the issue “very seriously”.
 






“I have seen the German foreign minister’s statement,” Khan said. “Germany will have to take the issue of Afghans in Pakistan seriously.”
 
 

Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold, and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers, who do not possess valid documentation.
Additionally, the spokesperson said that Kabul would need to take the issue of terrorism in Afghanistan seriously, stating, “Terrorist safe havens still exist in  Afghanistan.
“Pakistan knows how to defend its territory and its people,” Khan said.
“An operation was carried out in the border area with Afghanistan against terrorists,” he added, referring to drone strikes allegedly carried out by Pakistan on August 28. “Afghanistan needs to stop allowing its territory to be used for acts of terrorism.”
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
During the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Heads of State, members reaffirmed their commitment to the country’s establishment as an independent, neutral and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war and drugs, and expressed their readiness to support the efforts of the international community to ensure peace and development in the country.
“Member states reiterated that the formation of an inclusive government with broad participation of representatives of all ethno-political groups of Afghan society is the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the country,” the declaration said.</p><small>2025-09-05 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05161744a93aebc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939932/diplomatic-tour-de-force-chinas-xi-shows-hes-totally-in-charge' target='_blank'><strong>Diplomatic tour de force: China’s Xi shows he’s ‘totally in charge’</strong></a><br><p>When Chinese leader Xi Jinping organised his first parade to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II, in 2015, he placed his two predecessors by his side in a show of respect and continuity of leadership.
Ten years on and having eliminated domestic opposition as he serves an unprecedented third term as president, Xi was flanked on Wednesday at the 80th anniversary parade by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Chinese Communist Party leaders were interspersed among overseas guests.
The parade followed Xi’s high-profile summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a weekend meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tianjin, and the Chinese leader’s rare visit to Tibet last month.
This display of diplomatic clout, stamina and geopolitical ambition has helped quell concerns among some China observers about the 72-year-old president’s vitality, linked to sporadic absences and — so far unknown — succession plans. It has also helped divert domestic attention from slowing growth, experts say.

Longevity was on the leaders’ minds as they walked up to the rostrum at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square — Xi and Putin were caught in a hot mic moment discussing organ transplants and the possibility that humans could live to 150 years old.
“This week of triumphant diplomacy for Xi shows that he remains totally in charge of the elite politics of the Communist Party,” said Neil Thomas of the Asia Society, a New York-based think tank. Unable to get the same legitimacy from economic growth as his predecessors, Xi has turned toward nationalism “to try and make up for it”, Thomas said.
“It’s a way to divert attention from economic challenges and to make his citizens proud to be Chinese, even if it’s harder to feel that from the day-to-day experiences of unemployment, falling house prices and stagnant wages.”

Xi underscored his elder statesman image with fashion choices: a grey suit in the style of those worn by Mao Zedong, matching his greying hair, in contrast to the black suits of his counterparts and his own black attire from a decade earlier.
His number two, Premier Li Qiang, whose role has diminished at home, was charged with relatively minor meetings with leaders of Malaysia and Uzbekistan. High-profile engagements with Kim, Modi, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and several others fell to Cai Qi, who heads the party’s Central Secretariat, responsible for its sprawling administration.
In response to a Reuters request for comment, China’s foreign ministry referred to news conference transcripts related to the recent diplomatic events, showcasing China’s partnerships with developing nations and positioning Beijing as committed to peaceful development and international cooperation.

Many countries that sent their leaders to China in the past week have been hit by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs this year, including India, which remains a significant buyer of Russian oil, hit by sanctions over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
In one of the most memorable moments in the flurry of diplomatic encounters, Modi and Putin walked over for a chat with Xi while holding hands, underscoring personal tensions between Trump and Modi, as well as Washington’s failure to draw historically non-aligned India in to counter Russia and China.
“Ultimately one of the biggest driving factors of the SCO show of solidarity has been US policy,” said Even Pay, a director at strategic advisory firm Trivium China.
Trump, who called the military parade “beautiful” and “very, very impressive”, made a barbed post on social media saying China was working with Putin and Kim to “conspire against The United States of America”.
The Kremlin responded that they were not conspiring and suggested Trump’s remarks were ironic.

Hit by Trump, welcomed by Xi
Analysts say Xi’s whirlwind of activity underscores China’s ambition in presenting itself as a reliable partner to developing nations on the global stage, offering advantages like investment opportunities and even a new development bank — a major step forward for the SCO, which has expanded markedly over past decades to also include India, Pakistan and Iran.
“China’s message as a more reliable, stable alternative to the United States is resonating with large swathes of the world, particularly across Asia, which sees the United States as an increasingly belligerent force in world affairs,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of the China-Global South Project, a research agency.
“A lot of developing countries and middle-power states may still be a bit ambivalent about what China’s proposing with its new governance and development initiatives, but at least what China is talking about is forward-looking, which is crucial for economies with large populations of young people looking for better employment opportunities,” Olander said.
Xi faces considerable challenges in managing this large and often fractious coalition as he eyes a potential fourth term of office in 2027 to further cement his legacy as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao.

Entrenched Chinese foreign policy positions, including territorial disputes and industrial subsidies that have flooded foreign markets with cheap exports, will likely remain friction points, experts say, while India’s deep distrust of China will not dissipate because of one brief meeting.
“It’s not necessarily a big-picture shift towards a more China-led international order,” said the Asia Society’s Thomas.</p><small>2025-09-05 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0516111028fe4cb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939929/powerhouse-australia-up-for-challenge-of-defending-icc-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Powerhouse Australia ‘up for challenge’ of defending ICC Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Powerhouse Australia said it was “up for the challenge” on Friday of winning an unprecedented eighth ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, naming a star-studded squad to defend their title in India and Sri Lanka.
Led by Alyssa Healy, the 15-strong line-up features fellow seasoned campaigners Ellyse Perry, Beth Mooney, Annabel Sutherland, Tahlia McGrath and Ashleigh Gardner.
Sophie Molineux makes her return from knee surgery in January, while Darcie Brown (quad) and Georgia Wareham (groin) both brushed off recent niggles to take their places.
 






Molineux is among five Australians who will feature in a 50-over World Cup for the first time, alongside opener Phoebe Litchfield who was recently player-of-the-tournament at English cricket’s Hundred.
Leg-spinner Wareham, quick Kim Garth and batter Georgia Voll will also taste World Cup cricket for the first time.
The remaining quad members were all part of Australia’s 2022 triumph at the last tournament in New Zealand, where they thumped England by 71 runs in the final.
“A World Cup in India is one of cricket’s biggest assignments, but we believe this group is up for the challenge,” said national selector Shawn Flegler.
“The valuable experience the squad has gained from several sub-continent tours in recent years, as well as exposure through the Women’s Premier
League will be beneficial in tackling the unique demands of Indian conditions.
“The extended nature of an ODI World Cup can be a challenge, and we believe this group has the depth and versatility to meet those demands,” he added.
Australia have long been a dominant force in women’s cricket. Since 2018, they have won three T20 World Cups, a 50-over World Cup and the Commonwealth Games title.
The 13th edition of the World Cup begins on September 30 in India and Sri Lanka with Australia opening their defence in Indore against New Zealand on October 1.
Before that, they play three warm-up one-dayers against India in New Chandigarh and New Delhi.

The Khalistan movement is a Sikh separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory. It is considered a security threat by the Indian government.
The economist, Gunther Fehlinger-Jahn, appeared to be calling for the creation of Khalistan in his post on X, stating: “I call to dismanlte India into ExIndia. Narendra Modi is Russia’s man. We need friend of freedom for @KhalistanNet.”
The map also seemed to be implying the separation of various other regions of India.
 






According to NDTV, India’s Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology “flagged the viral post and directed X to withhold access to the account for Indian users. The account has since been disabled in India”.
The report added that the post resulted in “angry reactions” on social media.
The post came after Modi met with the Russian President Vladimir Putin
during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China earlier this week.
 
 

Sharing a picture of their interaction in another post on Monday, Fehlinger-Jahn stated: “I call for ExIndia. India is now a hostile state to [the] Free World. We must boycott India now! … No Visa for Indians as long as Putin’s friend Narendra Modi stays in power.”
 






Hehlinger-Jahn, as per his X and Linkedin, poses as the chairman for an “Austrian committee” the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).
However, a Google search did not bring up any results for such a committee.
In September 2023, Hehlinger-Jahn remarked about Armenia — whose relations with Russia have been strained in past few years — needing to join the Nato, according to Tass news agency.
In a post earlier today, Hehlinger-Jahn also called for the “fall of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the break up of Russia”.
According to a Reuters report in May, Putin’s conditions for ending the war in Ukraine include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging Nato eastwards.
New Delhi purchases oil from Moscow and after meeting Modi earlier this week on the sidelines of the summit in China, the Russian president reiterated the need for the issue of Nato’s eastward enlargement to be addressed.</p><small>2025-09-05 10:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05141708fbbed5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939907/daniel-levy-makes-shock-decision-to-quit-as-tottenham-chairman-after-nearly-25-years' target='_blank'><strong>Daniel Levy makes shock decision to quit as Tottenham chairman after nearly 25 years</strong></a><br><p>Daniel Levy stepped down as Tottenham executive chairman in a shock move on Thursday after a controversial reign lasting nearly 25 years.
Levy was the driving force behind Tottenham’s 1.2 billion ($1.6bn) stadium and state of the art training centre.
But the 63-year-old was a polarising figure among Tottenham fans, with numerous protests against him during difficult spell for the Premier League team.
 






Levy, who was the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, had come under fire more than ever over the last few seasons.
A series of failed managerial appointments and the club’s transfer policy infuriated supporters and turned up the heat on Levy, who was accused of caring more about the club’s financial profits than success on the pitch.
Tottenham endured their worst top-flight finish since 1976-77 last season, coming 17th before salvaging the campaign by winning the Europa League to qualify for the Champions League.
That success — which ended Tottenham’s 17-year trophy drought — was not enough to spare boss Ange Postecoglou from Levy’s wrath as the Australian was sacked after two turbulent seasons in charge.
Levy hired Thomas Frank from Brentford to replace Postecoglou in the last significant decision of his reign.
“I am incredibly proud of the work I have done together with the executive team and all our employees. We have built this club into a global heavyweight competing at the highest level,” Levy said in a statement.
“More than that, we have built a community. I was lucky enough to work with some of the greatest people in this sport, from the team at Lilywhite House and Hotspur Way to all the players and managers over the years.
“I wish to thank all the fans that have supported me over the years. It hasn’t always been an easy journey but significant progress has been made. I will continue to support this club passionately.”
Vinai Venkatesham was hired as Tottenham’s chief executive officer in April, while Peter Charrington joined the board in March and will step into the newly created role of Non-Executive Chairman.
‘A new era of leadership’
“I am very honoured to become Non-Executive Chairman of this extraordinary Club and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Daniel and his family for their commitment and loyalty to the Club over so many years,” Charrington said.
“This is a new era of leadership for the club, on and off the pitch. I do recognise there has been a lot of change in recent months as we put in place new foundations for the future.
“We are now fully focused on stability and empowering our talented people across the Club, led by Vinai and his executive team.”
Since Levy took the reins in 2001, Tottenham had won just two trophies, with the 2008 League Cup followed by the long wait that ended with last season’s Europa League final victory over Manchester United.
Levy became renowned for his ruthless sacking of managers as the likes of Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte, Mauricio Pochettino and Nuno Espirito Santo were dismissed.
Tottenham’s best period under Levy came during Pochettino’s spell.
The Argentine led Tottenham to three successive top three finishes in the Premier League and reached the 2019 Champions League final.
Even Pochettino couldn’t escape Levy’s axe, but the spotlight eventually turned on the chairman.
Tottenham fans were furious as their side spluttering badly last season and a difficult summer transfer window, which saw the club miss out on Morgan
Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze only increased the pressure on Levy.
One banner displayed last season at Levy’s pride and joy — the gleaming 62,000-capacity stadium that opened in 2019 — summed up the divisive nature of his reign.
“24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy — time for change” it said.
While Tottenham eventually added a trophy to that meagre haul in the Levy era, the disillusioned supporters have finally got their wish.
There will be no changes to the ownership or shareholder structure of the club following Levy’s departure.</p><small>2025-09-05 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05132239f11f2e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939900/new-recipes-help-pakistani-mothers-ward-off-malnutrition' target='_blank'><strong>New recipes help Pakistani mothers ward off malnutrition</strong></a><br><p>Clutching their hungry babies, a group of mothers mix a semolina dish under the guidance of a teacher, an attempt to curb malnutrition, which affects nearly one in two children in Sindh.
Despite Sindh being home to the mega port city of Karachi, the financial centre of the country that sprawls along the Arabian coastline, children in rural areas just a few hours away face stark levels of wasting and stunting.
In the arid village of Sujawal, lethargic children with prominent bones wilt in the searing heat as social workers educate mothers on nutrient-rich ingredients and dispel myths around food.
“Before, we only gave our children potatoes because they were always available at home,” said Shahnaz, 25, who has radically changed the diet of her six children, weak and frequently sick, after a year of classes.
Now, convinced that children should eat a varied diet, she has introduced affordable ingredients such as lentils and semolina into her cooking, lifting her daughter out of malnutrition.
In impoverished rural Sindh, 48 per cent of children under five suffer from malnutrition and 20pc from its most severe form, wasting, according to the latest national survey on the issue conducted in 2018.
In this class, Azma, a social worker, shows mothers how to cook with semolina — easily available in the market.
“Semolina is cheap — for 50 rupees it can last a week if you’re feeding one to two spoonfuls daily to a six-month-old child,” she explained to AFP.
In Sindh, a province of 55 million people where contraception remains taboo and large families are the norm, 3,500 mothers have benefited from cooking classes developed by UNICEF.
Like many mothers in the area, Kulsoom, 23 and pregnant with her sixth child, all born prematurely and underweight, once only fed her children pieces of fried flatbread.
“One of my children died, and my youngest is extremely weak, so I was advised to take these classes,” said Kulsoom, who goes by only one name, like most women in her district.

No spices
Parents are recommended to feed babies solid foods from about six months old, but in rural Sindh, this often means adult leftovers, too spicy for young stomachs.
“The main problem is the lack of dietary diversity,” says Mazhar Iqbal, a nutritionist for UNICEF.
In Pakistan, 38pc of children eat only two or fewer of the eight food categories recommended by UNICEF.
Meat is saved for special occasions, yet inexpensive protein alternatives exist, such as chicken offal, boiled bones, lentils and beans.
As for fruit and vegetables, they are usually fried, losing their nutrients.
Bakhtawar Kareem joined the programme after her child died of anaemia.
“I have no money. Sometimes we eat, sometimes we don’t,” she lamented, scanning the swollen belly of her one-year-old daughter, who has only sparse clumps of hair.
Like 72pc of children in the village, her daughter has stunting, well above the average rate in Pakistan of 42pc — one of the highest in the world.
Stunting is most closely associated with brain development and physical growth, and can have long-term physical and mental impacts.
Vulnerable to a lack of clean water and sanitation, which contributes to malnutrition, children often also suffer from dengue fever or malaria, from vomiting, diarrhoea, or difficulty urinating, and have abnormally swollen bellies.

Women eat leftovers
But the vicious cycle of malnutrition begins with the mothers.
“With early marriages and repeated pregnancies, more than 45pc of women in Sindh are anaemic,” said the nutritionist.
“This increases the risk of having low birth weight babies, who are more likely to suffer from malnutrition.”
In Sujawal, where only a quarter of the population can read and write, myths about food also deprive women of vital nutrients.
Farrah Naz, the head of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition in Pakistan, regularly has to repeat that eggs and dried fruits do not cause women to bleed more during their periods.
Cultural norms around women serving meals to men first and eating the leftovers — despite the physical work they carry out in the fields — also contribute to poor health.
“And when food runs out, it’s their rations that are cut first.”

The startup, heavily backed by Amazon, is known for its Claude chatbot and positions itself as focused on AI safety and responsible development.
Companies based in China, as well as in countries including Russia, North Korea and Iran, are already unable to access Anthropic’s commercial services over legal and security concerns.
ChatGPT and other products from US competitor OpenAI are also unavailable within China — spurring the growth of homegrown AI models from Chinese companies such as Alibaba and Baidu.
Anthropic said in a statement dated Friday that it was going a step further in an update to its terms of service.
Despite current restrictions, some groups “continue accessing our services in various ways, such as through subsidiaries incorporated in other countries,” the US firm said.
So “this update prohibits companies or organisations whose ownership structures subject them to control from jurisdictions where our products are not permitted, like China, regardless of where they operate.”
Anthropic — valued at $183 billion — said that the change would affect entities more than 50 per cent owned, directly or indirectly, by companies in unsupported regions.
“This is the first time a major US AI company has imposed a formal, public prohibition of this kind,” said Nicholas Cook, a lawyer focused on the AI industry with 15 years of experience at international law firms in China.
“The immediate commercial effect may be modest, since US AI providers already face barriers to operating in this market and relevant groups have been self-selecting for their own locally developed AI tech,” he told AFP.
But “taking a stance like this will inevitably lead to questions as to whether others will or should take a similar approach”. An Anthropic executive told the Financial Times that the move would have an impact on revenues in the “low hundreds of millions of dollars”.
The San Francisco-headquartered company was founded in 2021 by former executives from OpenAI.
It announced this week it had raised $13bn in its latest funding round, saying it now has more than 300,000 business customers. And the number of accounts on pace to generate more than $100,000 annually is nearly seven times larger than a year ago, Anthropic said on Tuesday.
Some users in China do access US generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Claude by using VPN services.
Assumptions that the US was far ahead of China in the fast-moving AI sector were upended this year when Chinese start-up DeepSeek unveiled a chatbot that matched top American systems for an apparent fraction of the cost.</p><small>2025-09-05 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05093934a16533a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939864/3-children-killed-5-injured-as-dumper-truck-runs-them-over-in-abbottabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 children killed, 5 injured as dumper truck runs them over in Abbottabad: police</strong></a><br><p>Three children lost their lives and five were injured as a dumper truck ran them over in Abbottabad on Friday at around 8am, police said.
Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com, “The accident took place as the school children were crossing the road near the Lady Garden public park.”
Afzal said a first information report was registered against the driver who fled the scene. The dumper had also been seized, he added.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said, “A rescue team was immediately dispatched to the accident site after receiving information about the incident. The bodies of the deceased, as well as the injured children, were taken to the district headquarters hospital.”
Following the incident, family members of the children and local residents staged a protest and blocked the Old Karakoram Highway, police spokesperson Afzal said.
They were demanding the arrest of the dumper truck’s driver, Afzal said, adding that the protest ended after negotiations and assurance by the police that the driver would be arrested.
Accidents involving dumpers are common in Pakistan, often linked to reckless driving, overloading, and poor vehicle maintenance, combined with weak enforcement of traffic laws. Many dumper drivers lack proper training, drive long hours without rest, or speed aggressively on congested roads, making it difficult to control such heavy vehicles.
In August, two siblings were killed and their father was injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road.
In July, at least five people were killed in a collision between a car and a truck in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district.
A young man and a woman also died in a road accident in February in Lahore when their car collided with a dumper. Both of them suffered multiple head and neck injuries which proved fatal.</p><small>2025-09-05 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/051101538ff04a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939739/heavy-rains-across-sindh-from-sunday-to-tuesday' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rains across Sindh from Sunday to Tuesday</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has predicted torrential rains in Sindh, besides eastern Punjab, from Sept 7 to 9 with occasional gaps.
According to it, a low-pressure system currently exists over the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and is likely to move towards west and northwest. It may travel to Rajasthan and its adjoining parts of Sindh on Sept 6.
Due to this weather system, strong monsoon currents are likely to penetrate Sindh and eastern Punjab from Sept 6 onwards.
The Met department has predicted that under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread rain and windstorm / thundershowers, coupled with scattered heavy to very heavy falls, are expected to hit Tharparkar, Islamkot, Nagarparkar, Chachro, Dhali, Diplo, Kaloi, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Matiari, Tando Allayar, Tando Mohammad Khan, Hyderabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Jamshoro, Dadu, Kashmore, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Ghotki from Sept 6 (evening / night) to Sept 9 with occasional gaps.
Torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Mirpurkhas, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tharparkar, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Hyderabad and Karachi from Sept 7 to 9, it said.

Sabalenka overcame Pegula 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a re-run of last year’s final and is seeking to become the first player to successfully defend the title in New York since Serena Williams in 2014.
The 27-year-old from Belarus is through to her third successive US Open final.
 






“It was a really tough match — she (Pegula) played incredible tennis as always and I had to work really hard to get this win,” said Sabalenka.
“Just super happy to be back in the final and hopefully I can go all the way again.”
Sabalenka has now made the final at four of the last five Grand Slams but has not added to her haul of three majors since winning the 2024 US Open.
She finished runner-up at the Australian Open and Roland Garros earlier this year.
“I badly wanted to give myself another opportunity, another final, and I want to prove to myself that I learned those tough lessons and I can do better in the finals,” added Sabalenka.
She landed the first blow in the sixth game against Pegula, who saved a pair of break points before the Belarusian’s persistence paid off as she surged into a 4-2 lead.
A sloppy service game from Sabalenka allowed Pegula to respond immediately.
The American then held to level at 4-4 and put the pressure right back on the top seed.
An error from Sabalenka gave Pegula another break for a 5-4 advantage and she served out to love to take the first set, to the delight of the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.
Sabalenka reset though and roared back to reel off the first three games of the second set, an early break the difference as she sent the match to a deciding set.
A break to open the third set saw Sabalenka edge 2-0 ahead. She scrambled to save three break points and stay in control at 4-2 in and fought off another in the eighth game to close in on victory.
Pegula held and forced Sabalenka to get over the line on her own serve. She eventually converted a third match point with a crunching forehand winner to her palpable relief.
“It was too good from her today at some points,” said Pegula.
Wimbledon rematch in final
Sabalenka will try to avenge her Wimbledon semi-final loss to Anisimova on Saturday.
The eighth-seeded Anisimova reached her second major final in a row after rallying to overcome Osaka 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 in a match that stretched well past midnight in New York.
“I wasn’t sure I would make it past the finish line. I tried to dig deep.
It was a huge fight out there,” said Anisimova.
“It means the world. I’m trying to process that right now, it’s a dream come true. The hope is to be the champion but I’m in the final now and I’m excited.”
 






Osaka, seeded 23rd, was enjoying her best Grand Slam run since winning her second Australian Open title in 2021 — the last of her four major crowns.
She looked on course to go a step further after taking the first set in a tie-break, boasting a 26-1 record at this level when doing so.
Four breaks in six games to begin the second set betrayed the nerves on both sides.
Anisimova broke for third time to go 5-4 up, but as in the previous two instances then lost her own serve, double-faulting to keep Osaka in the set.
In a reversal of the first tie-break, Anisimova took charge of the second to level the contest.
Anisimova carried that momentum into the decider and broke for a 3-1 cushion as she continued to punish Osaka’s ineffective second serve.
Two comfortable service games moved Anisimova 5-2 clear. Osaka held before the American earned two match points in a dramatic final game.
Osaka saved both and carved out two break points only for Anisimova to cut short the comeback and secure victory at the third attempt.</p><small>2025-09-05 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05105104afff3c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939829/punjab-cm-under-fire-over-port-a-loo-gaffe' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM under fire over  ‘port-a-loo’ gaffe</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came under fire from social media users on Thursday for sharing a two-year old image and claiming that it showed measures taken for the rehabilitation of flood victims.
“Innovated portable washrooms constructed and placed at relief camps in Chiniot,” she wrote on X, uploading a photo of a portable washroom.
But the image attached to the post — while showing a port-a-loo — also carries the date it was taken, which shows that it was taken in 2023.
Eagle-eyed social media users soon spotted that the photo did not appear to be recent, and was taken from the website of an online marketplace.
 






“Maryam should seriously consider sacking her PR & media team,” a journalist suggested on X (formerly Twitter).
Following the brouhaha over the outdated image, X accounts linked to PML-N began uploading images and videos from Chiniot, showing the actual portable washrooms that had been provided for those hit by the flood.
The account claimed that the Chiniot administration had shared the fresh video, adding that portable bathrooms are available in the field for flood victims to ensure their dignity was protected.
“The photo shared by the CM was shown as an example on a trial basis,” the account @EPropoganda1 wrote – which usually offers alternative views to posts that appear sympathetic to the PTI’s cause on social media.
A few days ago, the Punjab CM had hauled up the Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner for displaying her photograph on a mosque and ordered all departments to follow SOPs regarding the use of her likeness.

Fakhar hit an aggressive 44-ball 77 not out for his 12th T20I half century while Mohammad Nawaz smashed an undefeated 27-ball 37 to revive Pakistan from 80-5 Pakistan to 171-5 in their 20 overs.
Abrar then grabbed 4-9 in four economical overs to restrict UAE to 140-7 with opener Alishan Sharafu fighting a lone hand, scoring a steady 51-ball 68. Sharafu hit four sixes and as many fours.
 






“Fakhar and Nawaz played outstandingly well,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said after the match.
“Fakhar is a match-winner — he doesn’t always get the respect he deserves but he showed his (class) today.”
The win, Pakistan’s third in four games, not only took Pakistan to Sunday’s final but also ensured Afghanistan who face the hosts in the last group on Friday, would advance.
UAE’s power-hitters Mohammad Waseem fell for 19 and Asif Khan for seven as UAE suffered their third defeat in as many games.
Abrar’s previous best of 3-19 came against Bangladesh in Lahore earlier this year.
“I was watching the earlier matches and looking at the pitch conditions so I bowled accordingly,” said the bespectacled spinner. “Yes, there is a bit of extra pressure but the captain told me to be ready at any stage.”
 






Earlier, Pakistan lost five wickets for just 80 runs in 11.3 overs after they won the toss and batted.
Openers Saim Ayub scored 11 and Sahibzada Farhan made 16. Skipper Salman Agha hit seven, Mohammad Haris 14 and Hasan Nawaz four.
Fakhar and Nawaz added 91 off 51 balls for the sixth wicket to put the innings back on track.
It was Fakhar’s first half century in 14 innings since a match against Ireland at Dublin in May last year.
Fakhar’s knock contained two sixes and ten fours. Nawaz hit two sixes and three fours.
The pair launched vicious late attack, with 74 coming off the last five overs and 42 off the last two.
Nawaz smashed three fours and a six in Junaid Siddique’s penultimate over while Fakhar cracked five consecutive boundaries off Mohammad Jawadullah’s last over.
“Credit goes to Fakhar and Nawaz; they gave us those extra 20 runs,” said Salman. “We knew if we got to 170, we could defend it.”
Spinner Haider Ali was the most successful home bowler with 2-17.

“The government manipulated sugar prices by managing the supply of imported sugar verses locally produced sugar. As a result, Rs300-400 billion were taken out of the pockets of ordinary citizens and transferred into the hands of sugar mill owners,” Mr Abbasi said, addressing a news conference.
He added that government policies had provided undue benefits to sugar mill owners, while the beverages industry and other factories were forced to buy sugar at higher rates.
He claimed that even today an additional Rs1bn was going to sugar mill owners through the sale of costly sugar in the retail markets. The government, parliament and price control committees have failed to protect the consumers from this extortion.
“This is the state of governance in country,” Mr Abbasi remarked, adding, “The price of sugar has increased by 50 per cent in one year.”
 







Accuses NAB of protecting corrupt business practices instead of holding mill owners accountable

The former premier asked: “Will anyone answer for this sugar price hike?” He said that those in the government should at least admit their mistake, adding that NAB’s job seemed to be protecting corr­u­pt business practices in the country. The APP convener further said that the job of governments was to provide facilities to the people, but, successive governments had failed and caused economic hardships.
He said that the time to control markets through administrative efforts was over and added that if the price of sugar increases by just one rupee, Rs7bn are taken away from people.
 






He pointed out that there was a sugar monitoring committee of the cabinet and at least seven to eight other committees responsible for sugar price control.
“Despite so many committees, the price of sugar went up. When there was already a shortage in the country, why did the government allow its export?” he asked.
“The strange part is that while the private sector was exporting sugar, the government was importing it— and at prices higher than the international market,” he added. He concluded that sugar had not only become more expensive but had also grown scarce in the markets.

In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the forum said preliminary assessments indicated the loss of approximately 60 per cent of the rice crop, 35pc of cotton, and 30pc of sugarcane in central and southern Punjab.
Over 1.8 million people across the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej river basins have reportedly been severely affected, with floodwaters now moving southwards along the Indus River.
 
 

“The scale of devastation is staggering,” the letter stated, warning that key agricultural targets set for the current fiscal year may now be unattainable. It cautioned that Sindh could soon face a similar catastrophe if immediate preventive measures are not taken.
The PBF stated that losses have already run into billions of rupees, endangering rural livelihoods and placing additional stress on the broader economy. It emphasised that unless swift, coordinated action is taken, the crisis could spiral into a protracted humanitarian and economic emergency.

PBF warns 60pc of rice, 35pc of cotton and 30pc of sugarcane lost in Punjab; calls for loans, reforms to combat flood devastation

Calling the situation unprecedented, the forum proposed that the federal government officially declare an Agricultural Emergency and initiate immediate relief measures, including the provision of interest-free loans of up to Rs2 million for small and medium-sized farmers to support replantation and recovery efforts.
It also called for the launch of critical canal infrastructure projects in Punjab and Sindh to improve water management and resilience against future flooding.
While appreciating the government’s broader efforts in steering the country through various national challenges, the PBF stressed that the current agricultural crisis required a focused and urgent response. “This is no time for business as usual,” the letter read.
 
 

In addition to emergency aid, the forum recommended longer-term structural reforms. These include removing illegal encroachments along riverbanks, strengthening provincial irrigation and revenue departments, and implementing community-level water storage systems as part of a sustainable flood management strategy.
The PBF also called for the activation of district price control committees to curb hoarding and profiteering in staple food markets. Anticipating sharp supply shortages, it urged the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to authorise the import of wheat and rice through both public and private sector channels to ensure domestic price stability.
“The time for reactive planning is over,” said Khawaja Mehboob ur Rehman, President of the Pakistan Business Forum. “This crisis must be treated as a wake-up call to reform agricultural strategies. We must stop viewing floods purely as disasters and start managing them as resources.”
He added that the PBF stands ready to work closely with the government in crafting and executing a policy framework aimed at stabilising the agricultural sector and securing the country’s food future.
With floodwaters still advancing and relief efforts stretched thin, the PBF’s call reflects growing pressure on the federal and provincial governments to take decisive action to mitigate the immediate fallout and avert longer-term agricultural and economic decline.

While the department’s official name is set in law, Trump in an executive order is authorising use of the new label as a “secondary title” by his administration, a White House document said.
Defence officials are permitted to use “secondary titles such as ‘Secretary of War,’…in official correspondence, public communications, ceremonial contexts, and non-statutory documents within the executive branch,” according to the document.
It was not immediately clear when Trump planned to sign the order, but his public schedule for Friday said he would be signing executive orders in the afternoon as well as making an announcement in the Oval Office.
The president, a marketing-savvy real estate developer, has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he was mulling such a change.
Late last month, the 79-year-old Republican claimed the Defence Department’s title was too “defensive.”
The Department of War “was the name when we won World War I, we won World War II, we won everything,” he told reporters on August 25.
According to the White House document, the name change “conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve.”
Established in the early days of US independence, the Department of War historically oversaw American land forces.
A government reorganisation after World War II brought it along with the US Navy and Air Force under the unified National Military Establishment, which in 1949 was retitled to the Department of Defense.
“Restoring the name ‘Department of War’ will sharpen the focus of this Department on our national interest and signal to adversaries America’s readiness to wage war to secure its interests,” the White House document said.
The move is the latest overhaul at the Pentagon since Trump took office in January and appointed former Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the sprawling department.
Hegseth, a combat veteran, has repeatedly touted the push to restore a “warrior ethos” in the department, and has lambasted prior administrations for policies he and Trump have derided as “woke.”
Hegseth notably has sought to expel transgender troops from the military and change the names of bases that honoured Confederate troops back to their original titles, after they were renamed under former president Joe Biden.
While Trump’s order could potentially be rescinded by a future president, it “instructs the Secretary of War to recommend actions, to include legislative and executive actions, required to permanently rename” the department, the White House document said.</p><small>2025-09-05 04:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68ba1b4d9084c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939760/opposition-calls-strike-in-balochistan-on-sept-8' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition  calls strike in Balochistan  on Sept 8</strong></a><br><p>• Leaders from six parties warn of threats to democratic politics and provincial leadership
• Achakzai says provinces, local populations must get first right over resources
QUETTA: Six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan on September 8 to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a BNP-Mengal pu­­blic meeting at Shahwani Stadium two days ago.
Fifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and founder of the Balochistan National Party (BNP).
The strike was announced at a joint press conference on Thursday by Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Meh­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of ANP, National Party, PTI, and Majlis Wahdat-ul-Muslimeen.
They noted that senior leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achak­zai and Sardar Akhtar Mengal, had miraculously remained safe.
They warned that such acts were an alarm bell for all political forces struggling for the rights of the people and their resources.
Mr Achakzai said that for the last two days he had been unable to understand the purpose of the attack.
If the objective was to eliminate the entire provincial leadership, what benefit would that bring to Pakistan, he wondered.
He said although the Constitution had repeatedly been violated and trampled, yet no one had ever been punished.
‘‘We will continue our democratic and political struggle for its supremacy openly and boldly. We are no one’s slaves; here there are neither masters nor servants,’’ he said.
Mr Achakzai added the first right over resources belongs to provinces and their local populations, and their share must be clearly defined.
He said finding those responsible for the attack was the duty of the state since intelligence agencies claim to be the best in the world. “If they fail to find the culprits, then the state and its institutions will be held accountable for our killings. This is our will to our people,” he declared.
Announcing the protest for September 8, Mr Achakzai said: “If we had wished to exploit public emotions that night, our workers could have set fire to all police stations and government offices in the province. Instead, we chose a peaceful, serious, and effective political response. On September 8, trains, airports, wheels, and shutters will all come to a standstill.”
The PkMAP chairman invited all political parties, including PPP and PML-N, to join the struggle and “speak with the generals” by demanding that the country be run according to the Constitution, law, and democratic principles. He said only in such a system could Pakistan become an Asian Tiger within 10 years.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal said that had the perpetrators of the March 29 incident been brought to justice, the blood of innocents would not have been spilt on September 2.
He accused the state of employing every tactic against political workers while failing to trace terrorists. He alleged that elements both within and outside official institutions may be contributing to terrorism, adding that the rulers had learned nothing from the killing of Nawab Bugti and were now targeting them as well.

• Health ministry warns of cholera, typhoid, and dengue risks from contaminated water and stagnant pools
• No immediate desert locust threat, despite ideal rain conditions: UN report
ISLAMABAD: As severe flooding devastates the northern region and Punjab, with impending threats to Sindh, the international community, including the United Kingdom and the United Nations with their partners, has stepped up to aid the flood-stricken areas by releasing funds to expedite relief efforts and enhance disaster preparedness across Pakistan.
The United Kingdom on Thursday announced an additional 1.2 million pounds to help the government’s coordinated response and assist communities in Sindh prepare before disaster strikes.
According to a press release from the British High Commission, the new funding brings the UK’s total humanitarian assistance to £2.53m, providing life-saving support to over 400,000 people.
 
 

The new funds are being deployed to non-governmental organisations in Sindh to enable early warning systems, community evacuations, pre-positioning of essential supplies and the protection of livestock.
“Sindh is in a critical window to prepare and reduce the impact of the upcoming floods,” British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said. “For every dollar spent on prevention, up to seven dollars are saved in response. More importantly, lives are saved, and destruction is avoided.”
This aid complements £1.33m announced on Aug 22 for early response and relief efforts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. That support includes providing dry food rations, search and rescue operations, mobile medical camps and restoring irrigation channels.
Additionally, the UK has contributed £500,000 to the Start Ready Disaster Risk Financing system in Pakistan. The funds have been released to reach 20,000 people across Punjab, Sindh and KP to anticipate and mitigate humanitarian impacts from future flooding.
UN aid
The United Nations and its partners are also working closely with Pakistani authorities to assess the humanitarian impact of the floods and identify needs.
Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has released $600,000 from the Regional Humanitarian Pooled Fund to support relief and recovery efforts, according to a statement released by the UN Information Centre in Islamabad.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences and solidarity with Pakistan. He commended the Pakistani authorities for relocating more than one million people in Punjab, according to the statement attributed to his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.
Health advisories
Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Health has released advisories to combat the heightened risk of disease outbreaks.
The ministry’s research body, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has warned that extensive water contamination and disease-carrying vectors pose a severe threat to public safety.
The ministry stated that floodwater has contaminated supplies, raising the risk of a surge in diseases like cholera and typhoid. Additionally, vast areas of stagnant water have created ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, increasing the potential for Dengue Fever, Chikungunya and Malaria.
The advisories, available on the ministry and NIH websites, provide guidance on preventing and controlling vector-borne, food-borne, water-borne, vaccine-preventable diseases and conjunctivitis. A statement issued by the ministry urged all citizens to follow established safety protocols.
No locust threat
Separately, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report released on Thursday states that Pakistan faces no immediate threat of locusts.
The FAO’s “Desert Locust Bulletin” sta­ted that surveys in August found no locusts in key summer breeding areas, and while very small-scale breeding may still occur, “no significant developments are expected”.

• Experts fear catastrophe at Head Muhammadwala
• High flood warning for Kasur, Okara, Bahawalnagar and other cities
• Over 85 Sialkot villages cut off since Aug 26
• Fears of urban flooding as more rain expected from today
• Homes washed away, farmland destroyed in GB’s Deral valley
LAHORE: As the water level continued to rise in the Chenab River at Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah bridges, the urban centres of Multan and Muzaffargarh were facing a grave threat due to the extremely high-level flood that had not subsided des­pite the passage of 36 hours.
The National Disaster Management Authority also issued a “high flood” warning for Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Burewala, Arifwala and Bahawal­nagar, as water levels continue to increase in the Sutlej River.
Multan Deputy Commi­ssioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the flood level in the Chenab River was continuously rising, due to which water had reached the Akbar Flood Bund and the Sher Shah bridge, inundating several villages.
“The situation is likely to worsen due to the joining of the Ravi River and the Chenab,” DC Sindhu said, adding that the water was above 414 feet at Greywala Chowk and showing a rising trend. He said the decision to breach the dyke at Head Muhammadwala would be taken if the 417-feet threshold was crossed. The DC said that a record 400,000 people were relocated to safer areas in the district.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan said that the water gauge at Head Muhammadwala was recorded at 413.66ft — just a few feet short of the critical level of 417ft. He said the decision to breach the embankment would be based on the water flow speed, intensity, and other factors.
‘Non-technical and incorrect information’
However, the experts ap­­peared alarmed by the situation at Head Muham­madwala, claiming that the critical level was actually lower than 417 feet.
The former irrigation department experts said the technical committee, comprising the irrigation department and other de­­partments, provided non-te­chnical and incorrect in­­­­formation to the administration regarding the bre­­aching section. Accor­dingly, the water level at Head Muhammadwala was set at 417 (above sea level), based on the 1992 flood flow.
However, the bridge had not been constructed at the time and the area was an open floodplain, with no controlled area of the bridge obstructing the flood flow, they said, adding that the 417-feet thr­eshold would increase the pressure on the Nawabpur and Akbar Flood embankments.
Since the government did not reassess the critical level at this gauge following the construction of the bridge, the situation at this head was precarious. The slow discharge from Head Muhammad­w­a­­la caused flooding from Jewana Bangla to Head Muhammadwala, they said, adding that the Ravi flood flow was also stagnant at Sidhnai Head­wo­rks for the same reason.
 
 

They urged the authorities to review the critical level to save Multan bef­ore the flood moving from Chiniot towards Trimmu Head­works could merge with the current flood flow.
According to PDMA, the Chenab at Marala Head­w­orks was flowing at 117,369 cusecs. Khanki Headworks was reporting a steady flow of 248,840 cusecs, while Qa­­dirabad Headworks was steady at 385,228 cusecs. The flow at Chiniot Bridge was steady at 554,998 cusecs. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 520.50 feet; it was rising but remained below its maximum of 526 feet. Trimmu Headworks had a steady flow of 239,545 cusecs. At Head Muhammadwala, the level was steady at 414.00 feet against a maximum of 417.50 feet. The Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.40 feet against a maximum of 393.50 feet.
Indian dams threat
Addressing a press conference, PDMA chief Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water level in Indian dams was continuously rising. He said that New Delhi had issued seven warnings to Pakistan about opening dam gates and three in the last 24 hours. He said that Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab would be affected after the release of more water from Indian dams.
Mr Kathia said that the situation at Head Sindhnai along the Ravi was “problematic” as water levels continued to increase at Jassar as well as Shahdara Headworks. He attributed the increase in the water level to the ‘backwater effect’. The DG said that as many as 3.8 million people had been safely evacuated from flood-affected areas in Punjab. “Massive evacuations have been carried out in the past 24 hours, mainly in Toba Tek Singh, Pir Mahal, Kabir­wala, and Khanewal.”
Sialkot villages cut off
As many as 85 villages of Bajwat, a rural area situated near the Pak-India border, remained cut off from the Sialkot district. Flash floods and incessant rainfall in the catchment area have swept away a bridge.
The residents had been without electricity since August 26 — the day when the devastating rain of over 500mm submerged Sialkot and adjoining areas, including Bajwat, and some other villages in neighbouring Chaprar town. Though the local administration temporarily constructed a Bailey bridge to connect Bajwat with Sialkot, recent flash floods in Tavi and Chenab rivers eroded its foundations, rendering it unusable.
“…Bajwat’s 85 villages are disconnected….despite the fact we have tried hard to restore mobility of the people,” Rana Iqbal Harnah, an MPA from Sialkot, told Dawn.
Sialkot Deputy Com­missioner Saba Asghar Ali said that Bajwat has some local markets from where the people were meeting their needs to some ext­ent. She said the administration was making all efforts to help the residents, adding that they were using bikes to access the area as boats could not be used due to the uneven terrain.
A local official, on condition of anonymity, said the situation was dire, particularly due to a prolonged power outage.  Cha­­­­prar town and its three villages have also been affected by floods and rains,” said Muh­am­mad Nafees, the Chaprar union council secretary, situated near Bajwat. Mr Nafees said the supply of various items from Sialkot to Bajwat continued to be disrupted due to the situation, leading to a shortage of essentials.
Flash flood in GB
Meanwhile, a flood ravaged Deral Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, damaging at least 20 houses and farmlands, Dawn.com reported.
Deral Assistant Com­mis­sioner Waseem Abbas told Dawn.com that the flood occurred at 6am due to heavy rains, which engu­lfed the Gamari area. “As a result of the floods, 20 houses were damaged, of which five were completely demolished,” he said. “In addition, crops and trees were also damaged.” GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that timely information was received from the villagers, which saved dozens of lives.
Another rain spell
Separately, another monsoon spell from September 6 to 9 is expected across the country, including the Punjab districts of Sialkot, Multan, and Khanewal.
In Balochistan, most districts are set to receive “rain-wind/thundershower” on Sept 7-9 with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, rain-wind/thundershower, with isolated heavy falls, is expected from September 6 (evening) to 8 with occasional gaps, whereas Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cities will receive rainfall from Sept 7 to Sept 9.
