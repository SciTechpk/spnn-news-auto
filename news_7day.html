The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.
Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.

 

This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the elections and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.
“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”
Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.
The rise of political Islam
The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.
Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.
“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”
“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.
“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”
On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”
Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”
He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”
Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”
Prof. Imran, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy. “In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” he said. “A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”
He cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”
Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”
He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”
Observations from Washington
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.
The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace. Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.

Despite Western lamentation about the collapse of the rules-based order (it never represented rules or order to the majority of the Global South which was at the receiving end), the current structure does acquire its legitimacy via UN approval — at least for now, as sceptics see the BoP formation as Trump’s move to replace the UN with an entity he can control. Media reports in the West suggest that a fair amount of homework has already gone into giving concrete shape to the plan whose outlines will become clear on Thursday when many of the aspects covering the issues being mentioned here are likely to be made public.
Gaza’s rebuilding and rehabilitation will require tens of billions of dollars over a sustained period of time and it is yet to be seen where that level of funding will be coming from. Will the effort be mainly funded by the resource-rich Gulf Arab states or will global private investors also pledge funds for a share in Trump’s ‘Gaza Riviera’ pie?

 

Linked to the funding issue will obviously be the future of the Gaza Palestinians in the Strip because there are legitimate fears they might be pushed back into narrow ghettos between the plush high-rise waterfront real estate and Israeli security walls, buffers and barriers and deprived of access to the Mediterranean which they have enjoyed in the worst of times.

All eyes will remain on the Board of Peace meeting. So far only Indonesia seems to have pledged 8,000 troops for the ISF.

With not one Palestinian on the apex board and neither on the next tier (only one on the third and the lowest-level body), which member(s) of the BoP will stand up for the interests of the rightful owners of the land? As a group working in tandem, the Arab states and other nations, such as Turkiye, Pakistan and Indonesia, can exercise influence; it remains to be seen exactly how much they are willing to and to what end.
All eyes will remain on the BoP meeting because so far only Indonesia seems to have pledged 8,000 troops for the ISF; others including Pakistan are holding back till there is clarity that the troops will be in a peacekeeping rather than an enforcement role.
In other words, a mechanism will have to be agreed with Hamas for the group’s voluntary decommissioning of weapons.
Hamas’s agreement is a prerequisite or the whole edifice of the BoP and its plan will collapse, as no Muslim state appears prepared to participate in the ISF if it is mandated to use force to disarm Hamas, a task Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) couldn’t accomplish after two years of genocide and use of indiscriminate, unchecked firepower.
Any ISF and Hamas clash would trigger such anger in the home countries of the participating forces that it could very quickly destabilise some of them and upset the very delicate equilibrium that prevails there. Not coming to the aid of the Palestinians during months and months of IOF genocide was one thing. Militarily confronting Hamas will be altogether different.
Earlier, Hamas was very clear it would not give up weapons till a complete withdrawal of IOF from Gaza. That has not happened. Israel has fortified its positions within Gaza all along the eastern side and this has left the Strip narrower than it was. If the apartheid state does not agree to make concessions, it would be difficult to predict the consequences.
The psychopathic genocidal Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu remains in power at the head of a coalition of parties and leaders (nothing less than murderous gangsters in my view) even more extremist than himself, such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich who oppose any deal. Any concessions can bring down his government.
His government can also fall if it fails to exempt from compulsory military service the members of an orthodox Jewish party that has made its support to Netanyahu conditional on the exemption. This pushes him into a tighter corner and he knows if he ceases being prime minister, he will be a step closer to prison because the corruption charges against him are of a serious nature. He has profited in more ways than one from the Gaza genocide.
For now, the ‘ceasefire’ is said to be holding only because the Israeli genocidal machine has taken its foot off the accelerator. The killings have not stopped. Far from it. But yes, the rate of Israeli slaughter of Palestinians has slowed down. Since the ceasefire in October 2025, in four months, the IOF has killed a fifth of the number of Palestinians it was annihilating every month for two years since October 2023. And we are supposed to be grateful for this drop in the mass murder rate!
There are various benchmarks one could use to assess the BoP performance. To me, if at all the BoP decisions bring respite to those living or trying to survive in the killing fields of Gaza, and lead to the rebuilding and rehabilitation of their homes and infrastructure, with no accompanying displacement, then something positive would have been achieved.
The path to Palestinian statehood is still unclear. However, the genocide in Gaza has stripped Israel of the legitimacy it has claimed for its cause for years. Regardless of government positions in the US and Western Europe, among Gen-Z and other younger segments of their population there has been a dramatic shift from unconditional support for the apartheid state to the legitimacy of the Palestinian cause.
Decision-makers in the apartheid state should shed their hubris and look very carefully at the long-term consequences of such a shift.

Published in Dawn, February 15th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-15 04:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6990ff190d908.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973348/pakistans-us-test' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s US test</strong></a><br><p>THE trajectory of Pakistan-US relations has once again been defined by strategic pragmatism rather than a durable partnership. Recent statements from Washington reaffirm that bilateral engagement continues to revolve around two principal pillars: access to critical mineral resources and counterterrorism cooperation.
While the evolving US strategic posture in South Asia is largely shaped by its competition with China and alignment with India, Pakistan remains embedded within this framework due to its geostrategic relevance, serving as a check on India.
Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on South and Central Asia recently, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored these priorities. He noted that Washington is working with Pakistan to harness the potential of its critical mineral reserves, combining US government seed financing with private sector expertise to generate mutual economic benefits. At the same time, he emphasised that continued counterterrorism cooperation serves a dual purpose, strengthening Pakistan’s capacity to manage internal security challenges while addressing transnational threats that could affect the US and its partners.
Perhaps the Middle East does not fall within Kapur’s portfolio, and that is why he did not comment on Pakistan’s relevance in this context, especially in light of the growing crisis with Iran and the Gaza peace plan, ie, the Board of Peace, whose meeting is scheduled this month, and which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to attend. At the meeting, he would announce Pakistan’s commitment to the Gaza peace plan, particularly its contribution to a Gaza stabilisation force.
Pakistan is currently relevant across multiple domains of US geo-economic and strategic objectives, particularly in three regions: South, Central, and West Asia. In these different regions, Pakistan serves different US interests. If we set aside the Middle East for a while in Pakistan-US relations, America’s priority list would include counterterrorism cooperation, containing China, and economic cooperation in the mineral sector in South and Central Asia. Even Kapur hinted at the same in his briefing. However, in South Asia, three additional elements emerge.
First, encouraging India to develop independently, stand on its own, and preserve its freedom of action serves broader US strategic objectives, particularly preventing China or any single hegemonic power from dominating the region. At the same time, supporting Pakistan helps maintain a balance that checks Indian intentions.

Perhaps we need a new approach towards Afghanistan, one that is not aligned with any camp.

Second, through financial assistance via international monetary institutions and by enhancing economic cooperation in critical sectors, the US seeks to engage Pakistan. This approach encourages segments of Pakistan’s power elite to limit their inclination towards deeper strategic alignment with China, which could otherwise affect US influence and reduce India’s political appeal in the region.
Third, Pakistan serves as a primary partner for counterterrorism in Central Asia, but also in the broader SCO and regional context, where Pakistan can be viewed as a partner maintaining deep relations with the US. While this may continue to irritate Russia, Pakistan’s growing relations with Central Asian states also carry geo-economic advantages. However, Afghanistan remains a constraint in this design, and Baloch­istan, where mineral and counterterrorism interests converge, poses another critical challenge.
Interestingly, while the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs was briefing Congress, the deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, John Mark Pomeroy, was visiting Islamabad to explore and enhance partnership in the mineral sector. During a meeting with the interior minister, while condoling the tragic terror incidents in Islamabad and Balochistan, he emphasised that Pakistan believes in global partnerships to eliminate terrorism and promote investment, echoing the same position articulated by the assistant secretary himself during the congressional hearing.
The question is whether the US would partner with Pakistan to soften Afghanistan, the main hurdle in connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia, and enhance cooperation to build Pakistan’s counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities to reduce risks in Balochistan, which is essential for the utilisation of the province’s mineral resources.
Interestingly, Afghanistan and Balochistan both connect to the US and China’s strategic designs, particularly in counterterrorism efforts and competition in the race for rare earth minerals. China remains reluctant to intervene or deepen security cooperation beyond a certain point, as Beijing sees long-term political, strategic and economic consequences. In contrast, the US is a notoriously ambitious actor willing to take risks. If it is willing to take risks to denuclearise Iran to serve Israel and its Arab allies, would it be prepared to do something similarly provocative in Afghanistan, perhaps to create pressure or controversy over Bagram, as Trump had earlier instigated and tested reactions?
The US does not seem interested in intervening directly in Afghanistan, as it would be too early for another military involvement. The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution recently extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Afghan Taliban, indicating continued US attention and an indication that Washington still wants to give some more time to the Taliban regime.
However, one possibility cannot be ruled out that the US may increase its diplomatic as well as equipment support to Pakistan, targeting terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan, which will keep pressure on the Taliban regime. But, this level of intervention will likely remain minimal and may not help Pakistan influence the Taliban to cooperate on counterterrorism issues, and may not even be able to force the Taliban to change their attitude towards their own people.
Perhaps Pakistan needs a new approach tow­a­rds Afghanistan, one that is independent and not aligned with any camp, whether the US or China. Such an approach may help gauge the real potential for cooperation, as well as the adversity and costs involved. Pakistan also needs a different ap­­proach to dealing with Balochistan, a vision that begins a journey towards peace through peaceful means, which would enhance stability and long-term regional cooperation. But is this a wish list that the power elites would not like to read?

No doubt, the right to protest is constitutionally protected and the opposition’s concerns that their leader receive timely and specialised medical care is warranted. Yet, even as it encamps outside Parliament House, a harder truth confronts the opposition. Protest is a tactic — one that politicians, including Mr Khan, have employed in the past with considerable success.
But protest alone is not a strategy. It can certainly draw attention and mobilise support but it is not a substitute for sustained political engagement. Nor can it replace the arduous work of policy articulation and alliance-building that is required to convert street power into material political gains.
Some of the PTI’s grievances carry weight. Concerns about due process and prison conditions resonate with many citizens who feel alienated from the system. The government should not ignore these sentiments. Democratic maturity requires listening, even to one’s fiercest critics — something that our politicians have little appetite for. It also requires restraint by the government, as heavy-handed responses will only deepen polarisation and reinforce the opposition’s narrative of victimhood. Fortunately, there have been recent signs that dialogue is not entirely doomed. For instance, a meeting earlier between the prime minister and KP chief minister suggested that channels of communication, however fragile, remain open, and that it is possible for political opponents to engage on issues that demand cooperation.
This should not be underestimated and the opposition must draw the right lesson. Earlier, the opposition’s dramatic confrontations yielded results only when extra-parliamentary forces tilted the balance. Today, that dynamic is not in the opposition’s favour. In such a landscape, agitation without political engagement can become an exercise in futility. Without the magnetic presence of Mr Khan on the streets and without institutional fissures to exploit, protest on its own will not dislodge a government that retains its parliamentary strength. Such a situation does not mean retreat but rather recalibration. For instance, the opposition would need to frame clear, achievable demands not as ultimatums but constitutional rights.
In the long term, however, the challenge is deeper. What is the PTI’s policy alternative on the economy or counterterrorism or social welfare? What alliances can it build across ideological lines? How does it envision institutional reform beyond personalised politics? A movement always in protest mode risks hollowing out its own capacity to remain relevant. For its part, the government must recognise that exclusion breeds instability. By addressing legitimate concerns, it can lower political temperatures and boost democratic norms.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Cou­rt (LHC) has ordered a man to pay Rs1 million as deferred dower and monthly maintenance to his wife after holding that contracting another marriage without prior permission makes the entire dower immediately payable under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.
Justice Abid Hussain Chattha issued the judgement, deciding two cross writ petitions filed by Mehnaz Saleem and her husband Kashif Iqbal, challenging concurrent and appellate findings of a family court and additional district judge (the appellate court), Sialkot.
Ms Saleem had filed a suit seeking recovery of deferred dower (Rs1m), maintenance allowance, and dowry articles. The family court had partially decreed her suit, awarding Rs15,000 per month as maintenance for the Iddat period, Rs1m as deferred dower, and dowry articles or their alternate value of Rs1,000,500. Both parties filed appeals against the decision.
The appellate court dismissed the wife’s appeal and partially allowed the husband’s appeal, setting aside the maintenance and dower awards and reducing the alternate value of dowry articles to Rs400,000.
The matter was subsequently brought before the LHC.
On the issue of deferred dower, the LHC judge ruled that Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance created a statutory exception to the general rule that deferred dower became payable only upon dissolution of marriage.
The provision mandates that if a husband contracts another marriage without prior written permission of existing wife/wives or the Arbitration Council, he becomes immediately liable to pay the entire dower—whether prompt or deferred—to the existing wife.
Justice Chattha noted that the husband, in the present case, had contracted further marriages without obtaining the mandatory permission and had already been convicted on the wife’s complaint. His appeal against conviction had also been dismissed. In these circumstances, the judge held that the entire deferred dower of Rs1m became immediately payable. Justice Chattha observed that the marriage, solemnised on Nov 27, 2021, remained legally intact as no valid divorce had been established on record. The judge noted that there was no “divorce effectiveness certificate,” and mere assertion of oral talaq was insufficient.
Referring to the SC judgement in Ambreen Akram v. Asaullah Khan (2026 SCMR 1), the judge held that a wife’s right to maintenance flows unconditionally from a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty.
The judge found that the wife had been separated within one month of marriage and there was no convincing evidence that she left the house without lawful cause. The husband had also contracted subsequent marriages without prior permission.
The judge, therefore, held the wife entitled to maintenance at the rate of Rs15,000 per month with effect from Dec 27, 2021, with a 10 per cent annual increase, until her lawful entitlement subsists.
Regarding dowry articles, the LHC judge restored the findings of the family court, holding that the appellate court had erred in reducing the quantum on the basis of generalised social assumptions about second marriages.
Judge observed that dowry claims must be determined strictly on the basis of evidence and not on presumed social patterns or conjecture. He maintained that the family court had properly appraised oral and documentary evidence and awarded only those articles that were satisfactorily proved, or their depreciated alternate value. Consequently, the judge dismissed the husband’s petition and partially allowed the wife’s petition, declaring her entitled to deferred dower of Rs1 million, maintenance at Rs15,000 per month and dowry articles as decreed by the family court.

The registrar’s office issued separate notifications effecting changes to the composition of the IHC’s Administration Committee and its Selection Board for officers.
According to the notifications, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, who was transferred from the Sindh High Court along with Justice Dogar in February last year, has been replaced by Justice Muhammad Asif on the Administration Committee that takes key decisions related to the high court. A separate four-member committee, headed by Chief Justice Dogar, has also been notified. It includes Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Justice Azam Khan, and Justice Muhammad Asif.
In a parallel development, the Selection Board responsible for the recruitment and promotion of Grade-16 and above officers of the high court has also been reshuffled. Justice Khadim Soomro has been removed from the board, with Justice Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas named as its new members.
The administrative overhaul comes at a time when the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is expected to formally take up the issue of transferring judges from one high court to another.
Under the substituted Article 200, the president is now empowered to transfer a judge on the recommendation of the JCP, effectively removing the requirement for the consent of the judge being transferred. The amendment also stipulates that a judge who refuses to accept a transfer could face proceedings under Article 209 before the Supreme Judicial Council.
According to sources, at least three IHC judges are likely to be transferred to other high courts. Sources said Justice Soomro himself has sought transfer to his parent high court, the Sindh High Court.
In a separate administrative notification, Noor Muhammad Mirza, who has served under five chief justices, has been assigned a key position at the IHC. Mirza, a BS-21 officer, has been posted to the Chief Justice’s Secretariat. The notification stated that the appointment was made on the recommendation of the newly constituted Selection Board, comprising Justice Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, and was approved by Chief Justice Dogar.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman on Saturday dedicated his party’s landslide election victory to the citizens who “sacrificed for democracy” during the deadly 2024 uprising and pledged to prioritise the restoration of economy and governance.
Rahman, the 60-year-old scion of one of the nation’s most powerful political dynasties, called for national unity as he prepared to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s sweeping success in Thursday’s vote.
He will take over from an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has steered Bangladesh since a student-led uprising ousted Hasina in August 2024.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” Rahman said in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
The Election Commission reported the BNP alliance won 212 seats, securing a decisive two-thirds majority compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance. Turnout was reported at 59 per cent across 299 constituencies.
The win marks a remarkable turnaround for Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile in Britain.
However, he emphasised that the new government faces “daunting challenges”, putting the restoration of governance and the stabilisation of the financial sector at the top of his agenda.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions, and destroying law and order,” Rahman said. “We have very serious challenges to face … tackle the economy of the country … to ensure good governance.”
Voters on Thursday also endorsed a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus through a concurrent referendum.
The approved reforms include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence intended to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from participating in the polls. Speaking from hiding in India, the 78-year-old former leader — sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity — issued a statement decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.
Conversely, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, whose party quadrupled its seats in parliament, conceded on Saturday despite initially alleging “inconsistencies”. He pledged to serve as a “vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Rahman urged political rivals to work together following the tumultuous transition. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.
Rahman is the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died last year. While rivals have criticised his political career for alleged corruption, charges he has denied, his party’s commanding majority is viewed by analysts as a crucial opportunity to restore political stability.
“The freedom-loving, pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” Rahman said.

In a speech delivered by Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa at the African Union summit in Ethiopia, Abbas emphasised the necessity of enabling the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee daily governance in the enclave.
Removing these barriers is crucial to “ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery,” Abbas said.
Abbas accused Israel of “continuing to violate” the ceasefire agreement with Hamas that took effect in October. He noted that continued violence threatens the truce.

African Union commission chair demands end to ‘extermination’ of Palestinians

“From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed, which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase,” he said.
Despite the truce entering its second phase last month, the Israeli army retains control over more than half of the Gaza Strip. Fifteen experts on the technocratic committee, overseen by a “Board of Peace” set up by US President Donald Trump, remain based in Egypt.
This comes despite a partial reopening on Feb 2 of the Rafah border crossing.
Nickolay Mladenov, a diplomat appointed by Trump as high representative for Gaza, cautioned on Friday that “a number of conditions need to be met” before the committee can enter the territory. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mladenov said Hamas must transfer civilian control of institutions. “This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated,” Mladenov said. “We need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza.”
Separately, African Union Commission Chairman Mahmoud Ali Youssouf opened the organisation’s 39th summit by declaring the “extermination” of the Palestinian people must end. “In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop,” Youssouf said.
Youssouf also highlighted multiple conflicts in Africa, noting that from Sudan to the Democratic Republic of Congo, people continue to pay the “heavy price of instability”.

THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan threatened to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India.
But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar.
Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place.
The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage.

Pakistan to face India today

A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe humbled Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening.
Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years.
Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq.
Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing.
He has already been reported twice and cleared twice.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive.
If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant.
Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games.
But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI.
Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions.
Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s.
Political factor
Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s exclusion from the tournament.
Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game.
It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become.
For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash.
Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides.
The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament.
But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive.
Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it.
The oxygen is back. Let the match begin.

In December 2025, the group acquired a 75pc stake for Rs135 billion, with the goal of transforming the loss-making airline through operational restructuring, fleet expansion, and improved customer service. To ensure the success of its revival plan, the consortium now seeks to take full control of decision-making.
The acquisition will allow the consortium to implement management changes by the end of April. Shahid Ali Habib, CEO of Arif Habib Ltd, told Dawn that this will enable them to operate as a private entity, free from government-appointed board members.
“The change of sponsors is scheduled for late April or early May,” he added.

Consortium to acquire remaining 25pc stake for Rs45bn

The government has given the consortium a 90-day window to purchase the remaining shares, valued at approximately Rs45bn, with the deadline set for the end of April. The agreement, signed in January, allows a 12-month period to transfer funds, making the acquisition a viable option.
The winning consortium includes Fatima Fertiliser (34.1pc), Fauji Fertiliser (33.9pc), Lake City (16pc), and the City School with AKD (Aqeel Karim Dhedhi) Group (16pc). The new management, supported by Rs125bn, will have the financial flexibility to implement reforms, with the new board tasked with raising capital for PIA’s rebranding.
PIA was established in 1955 and became a public limited company in 2016 through the Pakistan International Airlines (Conversion) Act.
Following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in May 2024, PIA was delisted from the stock exchange and became a wholly owned subsidiary of PIA Holding Company Ltd (PIAHCL), formed in March 2024 to oversee the airline’s privatisation.

• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps
LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.
“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.
On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. 
The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  
Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.
“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.
He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.
The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.
He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.
He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.
Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.
He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. 
He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.
Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.
He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.
Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. 
He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.
He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.
The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.
He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.
“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.
Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.
“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.

In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.”







“The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said.
“There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said.
Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution.
“Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists.
“A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said.







The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment.
The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party.
The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others.







PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board.
“It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn.
TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance.
“We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated.
However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers.
“They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said.
In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”.







Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital.
“If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers.







‘Parliament turned into a prison’
Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”.
“We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X.
“Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.”
“We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added.
The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health.







In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”.
Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets.







PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House.
“We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”.
“The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed.







TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises.
“On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said.
According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night.
Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in.







PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors.
She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.”
She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye.
Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament.
“Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”.
“Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”.
The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released.
He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked.
Govt told to not escalate situation
Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand.
They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles.
They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled.
Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked.
Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government.
Reporters decry mistreatment
The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises.
A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating.
“Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said.
According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away.
“An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said.
The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.”
It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.”
The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”.
The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”.
KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful
Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful.
“Imran Khan sahib’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X.







He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well.
“Those opposing Imran Khan sahib, who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.”
The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib’s family and party,” Afridi added.
“A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised.







SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema
Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government.
In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC.
“The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted.
Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”.
“The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said.







She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists.
Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!”
“Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”.
“PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded.
“Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.

The second day unfolded across two major sessions, one honouring literary legends of mother languages, the other examining endangered arts and musical instruments, yet both were threaded by a shared concern about cultural survival.
The opening session, ‘Celebrating the Legends of the Languages’, brought together writers representing Brahui, Seraiki, Punjabi, Urdu, Balochi, Sindhi and Potohari. Yet, behind the tributes lay a pressing question of inheriting these languages.
The concern was echoed by panellists representing Gojri, Pahari, Hindko and Gawarbati languages as well, who stressed that recognition without institutional backing risks reducing linguistic heritage.

Brahui language poet Tahira Ehsaas Jattak, widely recognised as one of the first prominent female poets in the language, recalled her own struggle for education in Khuzdar.
“I was the only girl in my school at that time,” she said. “The first to pass matric and intermediate. Today, I see more girls studying, but I still ask in which language they are dreaming, in English?”
She stressed that children in many parts of Balochistan and elsewhere are not being taught in their mother tongues. Though initiatives were launched in recent years to introduce local languages into curricula, the lack of trained teachers and institutional support has stalled meaningful progress.
Balochi scholar Abdul Saboor Baloch traced his lifelong journey from a magazine-reading schoolboy to chairing the Department of Balochi at the University of Balochistan and later leading academic projects internationally.
With over 18 books and numerous research publications, he remains cautiously optimistic.
“There is more material to read now, more students enrolling in Balochi studies,” he said. “But preservation cannot depend on passion alone; it needs policy,” Saboor said.

The second session, ‘Endangered Arts, Crafts and Instruments of Pakistan’, opened with a Unesco documentary on the boreendo, an ancient clay wind instrument from Sindh, setting the tone for a discussion on vanishing sonic traditions.
Filmmaker Jawad Sharif, whose documentary Indus Blues explores endangered instruments, shared examples of generational shifts. In Peshawar, he noted, a sarinda player’s son now prefers the saxophone.
Salman Tahir of Citizens Archive Pakistan argued that archiving must go beyond documentation.
“When we look at a craft, we must look at the technical knowledge behind it, the muscle memory, the migration history, the politics of the artist’s life,” he said. “If we remove these from context, we distort the heritage itself.”
He stressed economic sustainability as the real battleground for cultural survival. “We can talk about preservation in air-conditioned halls but if an artist sleeps hungry, what kind of preservation is that?” he asked.

Author Gulzar Gichki spoke passionately about the soroz, a bowed instrument central to Balochi classical storytelling traditions. His book Suroz documents its history not merely as a musical tool but as a vessel of epic poetry and even traditional healing.
“This instrument is not only for music, but it also carries our stories, our memories. In the past, it was even used for treatment. It is part of who we are,” he expressed.
Yet, like many indigenous instruments, the soroz faces dwindling practitioners.
Youth activist Raaziq Faheem described efforts in Balochistan to train young men and women in folk instruments through structured programmes. Preservation, he argued, must extend beyond museum display.
“You can preserve an instrument in glass,” he said, “but can you root it in contemporary life? Can it add value to the lives of young people?”

Across both sessions, a shared understanding emerged that mother languages and musical traditions are not vanishing quietly; they are negotiating space within a rapidly modernising society.
Speakers agreed that innovation and adaptation are essential.
Universities, archives, filmmakers and cultural organisations were recognised not merely as observers but as active custodians.
The festival ultimately felt less like a warning bell and more like a chorus, voices from every language, asserting that heritage survives when communities choose to sustain it.
As speakers put it, preservation is not about resisting change. It is about ensuring that when change comes, it carries the language and the music along with it.

“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel’s unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the United States and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, “Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree,” the foreign ministry says on its website.
The United States will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough.</p><small>2026-02-14 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14190922038afad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973178/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs38bn-ramazan-package-for-12m-deserving-families' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs38bn Ramazan package for 12m deserving families</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package which will be disbursed among deserving people across the four provinces as well as the people of Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK).
“Rs38bn will be disbursed through digital bank accounts among 12.1 million families, without discrimination,” said the premier while addressing the ceremony of the PM Ramazan Package 2026.
“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.







The prime minister elaborated that out of the Rs38bn, Rs10bn is reserved for those families already registered with the government’s Kafalat programme.
“This is the biggest effort at the federal level in terms of volume and challenges for the month of Ramazan,” he said, adding that the government, through coordinated efforts, has undertaken a major challenge to ensure that deserving people across the country receive the funds.
PM Shehbaz also assured of a periodical review of the initiative’s progress.
The prime minister thanked international partners for their valuable contribution, interest and concern, saying, “Together we will achieve this landmark.”
At the onset of his address, the premier highlighted loopholes in previous Ramazan packages, including substandard food items and long queues at utility stores, which “compromised the dignity of deserving people,” saying, “It was a painful sight.”
“We ended it last year, and a major commitment was made to transfer cash through a digital system. It was a new initiative to replace the corrupt system and introduce a better one.”
He also shared challenges of the new system, including the willingness of banks to participate, the lack of a fully developed cashless economy in Pakistan, and the challenges encountered by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
“This year, the same experiment is being repeated with better performance and KPIs (key performance indicators),” he said.
This year, the relief amount has been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000 for each family that is not benefiting from other sponsorship programmes. Rs28bn has been reserved for them under the package.
The central bank has also issued a framework for the payment under the system to make the disbursement transparent, speedy and secure.

Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the package would be distributed among 1.2 million families. It will, in fact, be distributed among 12.1 million families. The error is regretted.</p><small>2026-02-14 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1421174624478aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973198/karachi-police-clash-with-jamaat-i-islami-workers-outside-sindh-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police clash with Jamaat-i-Islami workers outside Sindh Assembly</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Police clashed with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) workers outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday.
Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces.
The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the Sindh government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions.
Speaking on Geo News, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that police and the provincial government were in contact with the party’s administration since 4pm, telling them that they may protest but not enter the Red Zone.
“They were strictly forbidden from entering the Red Zone, but despite that, JI party workers entered the Red Zone, pelted stones at the police, and also tried to enter the assembly,” Memon stated.
He added that police were forced to use tear gas and arrest workers.
“You cannot enter the Red Zone under [Section] 144; the JI entering like this is a violation of the law,” the minister asserted. “No one will be allowed take the law into their own hands.”
Asked about comments by JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, maintaining that the protesters were peaceful, Memon questioned why they had to come to the assembly when it was closed.
The minister claimed that the only reason they wanted to enter the assembly was to vandalise it.
“We’ve been in contact with them since 4pm, but they violated the agreement by entering the Red Zone and then pelted stones at the police. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from anyone,” Memon said.
In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that it had already been stated that permission would not be given to march toward Sindh Assembly.
“Police were pelted with stones; we were forced to take this step,” he said.
“Nobody is allowed to violate the law … taking the law into your own hands is absolutely not permitted,” he said. The Sindh home minister appealed to the public to remain peaceful and not become an instrument of those who wanted to spread chaos.
Sindh Government Spokesperson Aqraba Fatima issued a statement encouraging the JI and all political parties to protest peacefully and within the ambit of the law.
“Security concerns arise due to crowds in sensitive areas,” she was quoted as saying, adding that the JI need to act responsibly.
The spokesperson added that the authorities have been in contact with the party so that the situation does not drag on.
“Civil life being affected under the guise of protest is not acceptable in any way,” Fatima added. “The government believes in dialogue and the Jamaat-i-Islami is expected to cooperate positively.”
She added that political activities should not affect Karachi’s routine and that peace in the metropolis is a shared responsibility.
‘Police attacked peaceful protesters with batons’
Meanwhile, the JI chief took to X and said that the “entire country is witnessing the fascism” of the PPP, attaching videos and photos of police action against the protesters.
“Using tear gas on peaceful citizens and attempting to stop the sit-in at the Sindh Assembly is proof of the Sindh government’s failure and desperation,” he stated.







JI provincial lawmaker Muhammad Farooq told reporters that police shelled and attacked peaceful protesters with batons, accusing the governing PPP of “fascism”.
“We were coming to demand Karachi’s right to live,” he asserted. “The PPP arrested several Jamaat-i-Islami workers, which is an undemocratic act. Release the missing and arrested workers immediately.”
The MPA said that the demonstrators were not heading towards a “palace” and that the people of Karachi “are not courtiers”.
“When we pay taxes, the rulers enjoy their luxuries. The PPP provincial government is stripping the people of Karachi of their right to live,” Faroq asserted. “The PPP provincial government is not even allowing us to protest in accordance with the Constitution.”
Calling the PPP a “product of authoritarianism which promotes fake democracy”, Farooq alleged that the United Nations had placed a ban on tear gas shells, which the police were using.</p><small>2026-02-14 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/142042217f99e8d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973201/fm-dar-saudi-counterpart-discuss-evolving-regional-situation-in-phone-call' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar, Saudi counterpart discuss ‘evolving regional situation’ in phone call</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar discussed the “evolving regional situation” in a phone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
“The two leaders discussed the evolving regional situation, forthcoming international engagements, and agreed to remain in close contact,” the FO said on X.







Dar had also held a phone call with the Saudi foreign minister last month, shortly after landing in Beijing. According to the FO, the pair “deliberated on the recent situation in the region” during the phone call.
This was the second call between the two in the same week. On December 30, 2025, the two had exchanged views on “the current regional situation and recent developments”.
Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September 2025, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both.</p><small>2026-02-14 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/142024357003ba1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199/t20-world-cup-suryakumar-says-india-vs-pakistan-not-just-another-game' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Suryakumar says India vs Pakistan ‘not just another game’</strong></a><br><p>India captain Suryakumar Yadav admitted on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.
“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo, venue for Sunday’s massive Group A showdown.
“No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”
The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R Premadasa stadium with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.

 

The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government reversed its decision to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly,” said the Indian skipper.
“But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.
“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” said Suryakumar.
“According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”
The Indian captain would not say whether his players would shake hands after snubbing the Pakistan team in three Asia Cup meetings in Dubai last year.
“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”
India achieved a hard-fought 29-run win against the United States in the first match of their title defence in Mumbai a week ago, before crushing Namibia by 93 runs in Delhi on Thursday.
But Suryakuma played down the hype around Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq and his unique sling-arm bowling action that has an exaggerated pause in the delivery stride.

 

“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions, so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.
Suryakumar said dashing opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a stomach bug and was likely to play.
Both Pakistan and India have won their opening two Group A matches and the winners will qualify for the Super Eight Stage.</p><small>2026-02-14 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14193707f92866d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973196/5-european-countries-say-russia-poisoned-putin-critic-navalny-in-prison-with-rare-toxin' target='_blank'><strong>5 European countries say Russia ‘poisoned’ Putin critic Navalny in prison with ‘rare toxin’</strong></a><br><p>Five European countries — including Britain, France and Germany — accused Russia of “poisoning” opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a “rare toxin”, on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body.







The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the UK foreign office added in a statement.

 

Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
“Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
“I was of course certain that it was a murder … but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts,” Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog — the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — over the finding.
“We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin’s inner circle.</p><small>2026-02-14 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141815459d848a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973191/extremely-happy-to-hear-their-voices-aleema-says-imran-spoke-to-his-sons-for-approximately-20-minutes' target='_blank'><strong>‘Extremely happy to hear their voices’: Aleema says Imran spoke to his sons for approximately 20 minutes</strong></a><br><p>Aleema Khan, the sister of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, said on Saturday that the former premier spoke to his sons for approximately 20 minutes and was “extremely happy to hear their voices”.
The development comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Imran after a report submitted by his lawyer, Salman Safdar, revealed that the former prime minister had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye. The court had also directed that he be allowed to speak to his children.
In a post on X on Saturday, Aleema said, “The chief justice of Pakistan had directed that Imran Khan be allowed to speak with his sons. We can confirm that he was able to speak with them for approximately 20 minutes.
“His sons shared that he was extremely happy to hear their voices after such a long time,” she said.







“We are now awaiting his urgent medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad under the supervision of his personal doctors, where specialist doctors must make every possible effort to restore his eyesight,” she said.
“The intentional delay in providing him timely treatment has already caused damage to his eyesight. We cannot and will not tolerate any further delay, and immediate specialist care is essential to prevent any permanent loss of vision,” she said.
It is worth mentioning that Imran’s sons, Kasim and Sulaiman, have repeatedly said over the past year that they have been unable to meet their father since his arrest.
On Thursday, after the report regarding Imran’s vision loss was submitted to the court, Kasim had termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”.
He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added. He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.</p><small>2026-02-14 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14123932a3cb24a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973171/case-registered-as-death-toll-of-multi-vehicle-crash-on-m9-motorway-rises-to-13' target='_blank'><strong>Case registered as death toll of multi-vehicle crash on M9 motorway rises to 13</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll from a multi-vehicle crash on the M9 Motorway a day earlier rose to 13 on Saturday while police also registered a first information report (FIR) on several charges, including unintentional murder.
The executive director of the trauma centre at Civil Hospital, Dr Mohammed Sabir Memon, told Dawn that six injured people were brought to the facility on Friday evening.
Of them, a six-year-old boy died during treatment, he said. He added that one patient had been discharged while four others were still under treatment, including one in critical condition.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that the 12 other victims all belonged to the same family.
Meanwhile, Gadap police Station House Officer (SHO) Sarfraz Jatoi told Dawn that the police had registered an FIR under sections 320 (unintentional homicide caused by rash or negligent driving) and 337-G (injuries) of the Pakistan Penal Code and relevant sections (3, 4, 5 and 115) of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance on the complaint of Motorway police Sub-Inspector Mushtaq Ahmed.
He said that four vehicles were involved in the accident. He said that the drivers of two vehicles (an oil tanker and a Hilux pickup) were killed on the spot.
He said that the driver of the third vehicle (trailer) was released after an initial probe. However, the driver of the fourth vehicle, a passenger van, managed to escape from the scene.
The officer said that during the initial probe, it emerged that the driver of the tanker was driving rashly.
Initially, the driver of the tanker hit the trailer and the heavy vehicle went out of control, colliding with the Hilux pickup and the bus, which were both travelling in the wrong direction. He said the tanker also had a “fitness issue”.
According to the contents of the FIR, the complainant said that he and other staff rushed to the spot after receiving information about the accident.
He said he saw the drivers of the tanker and the Hilux pickup had died on the spot. During the examination of the damaged vehicles, it transpired that the tanker and the trailer were travelling in the right direction while the passenger van and the Hilux pickup were travelling in the wrong direction.
The complainant quoted witnesses as saying that the passenger van and the Hilux pickup were coming from the wrong direction when they collided with the tanker. He said that prior to this, the tanker had hit the trailer, causing both vehicles to spiral out of control. As per the FIR, the driver of the coach had managed to escape from the spot.
During examination of the damaged vehicles, it transpired that the passenger coach did not have a route permit or a fitness certificate and was also fined in the past, the complainant said.
As per the FIR, during the examination of the tanker, there was no fitness certificate found nor did the driver have a licence.</p><small>2026-02-14 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141457163317941.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973180/imran-bushra-move-ihc-to-suspend-toshakhana-2-sentences-on-medical-legal-grounds' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra move IHC to suspend Toshakhana-2 sentences on medical, legal grounds</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking suspension of their sentences in the Toshakhana-2 (Bulgari jewellery) case, citing grave medical concerns and what their counsel termed legal infirmities in the trial court verdict.
Advocate Salman Akram Raja, along with Barristers Salman Safdar, Gohar Ali Khan, and Qausain Faisal Mufti, filed the petition under Section 426 read with Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898, praying for the release of the petitioners till the final adjudication of their criminal appeal.
The Special Court Central-I judge, on December 20, 2025, convicted the couple, handing down a 10-year simple imprisonment term under Section 409 PPC (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), along with a fine of Rs16.425 million. Additionally, Imran and Bushra were sentenced to seven years’ simple imprisonment under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
The petition contended that the conviction under two separate enactments for the same alleged act violated the principle of double jeopardy enshrined in Section 26 of the General Clauses Act 1897.
“Such dual conviction for the same alleged act is wholly beyond the mandate of law, as the petitioner could, at best, have been convicted under either of the two provisions, but not under both,” the petition argued.
Medical grounds formed a significant part of the suspension plea. Citing proceedings before the Supreme Court on February 10, 2025, wherein the lead counsel for Imran was appointed as amicus curiae, the petition noted that a medical report submitted by Dr Muhammad Arif of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) revealed severe damage to the Imran’s right eye.
According to the report, a blood clot had left the former prime minister with only 15 per cent vision in the affected eye, with treatment not possible within jail premises.
The petition further argued that the trial court erred in holding Imran to be a “public servant” within the meaning of Section 21 PPC, relying upon PLD 2024 SC 102 and Indian Supreme Court precedent. It was contended that elected holders of public office do not qualify as public servants for the purpose of Section 409 PPC.
Challenging the prosecution’s narrative, the petitioners maintained that gifts received from the Toshakhana were duly deposited and retained after payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000, strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy 2018.
The petition also raised objections to the treatment of prosecution witness Sohaib Abbasi as an approver, contending that the mandatory procedure under Section 337 CrPC was not followed.
It was argued that witness Syed Inamullah Shah, being a material participant in the alleged transaction, ought to have been arrayed as an accused rather than examined as a routine prosecution witness, reflecting a “selective approach manifestly demonstrative of mala fide intent”.
The petitioners highlighted that they remained on bail throughout the trial and faithfully complied with all terms and conditions imposed by the trial court.
The accompanying criminal appeal assails the conviction on substantial questions of law and fact, with no likelihood of immediate hearing, necessitating the suspension of sentence to prevent “manifest miscarriage of justice”.
The former PM and his spouse also filed separate petitions for early hearing of £190m corruption case. The registrar office is likely to place this matter before the bench next week.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1414410565f3c55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973179/pm-shehbaz-meets-naqvi-directs-him-to-address-security-situation-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Naqvi, directs him to address security situation in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad in a meeting on Saturday.
A press release by the prime minister’s media wing said that during the meeting, the interior minister briefed the premier on the overall security situation of the country.
“The prime minister was also given a detailed briefing on the current overall situation and security in Islamabad,” it added.
According to the press release, PM Shehbaz directed Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad and other matters “in an effective and efficient manner”.
The statement by the premier’s media wing further said that Naqvi would soon visit Sri Lanka, where he would “convey the prime minister’s special message” to the Sri Lankan president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Islamabad has experienced two major suicide attacks in recent weeks. One occurred on 6 February, when 36 people were killed and over 150 injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers.
The other attack took place in November, when a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area killed 12 people and injured more than 30.
PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari had held a meeting at the Presidency on Thursday to take stock of the political and security situation.
The meeting was also attended by Naqvi, as well as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and other officials.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141242006b23881.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973173/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-poised-to-be-pm-as-jamaat-i-islami-concedes' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman poised to be PM as Jamaat-i-Islami concedes</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.
The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.

Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.
His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.

The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
‘Verdict of the people’
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”.
But a day later, he conceded defeat.
“In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement.
“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.”

Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”.
The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”.
‘Successful’
Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”.
Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.
“It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.
“People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.”

The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.
“With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.”
Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”.
‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“.







The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”.
Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”.
It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”</p><small>2026-02-14 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14130434ef2c121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973174/riverine-areas-of-rahim-yar-khan-rajanpur-cleared-of-dacoits-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Riverine areas of Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur cleared of dacoits: Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks.
“It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas.
Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.”
“In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said.
She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.”
Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation.
She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads.
CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols.
The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh.
She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government.
Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.”
She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.”
“The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.”
The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.”
“It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam.
The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.”
“From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added.
She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation.
Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.”
Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose.
Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.</p><small>2026-02-14 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141249309cc4cdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973172/burden-of-electricity-tariff-revisions-should-not-fall-on-middle-lower-income-households-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Burden of electricity tariff revisions ‘should not fall’ on middle, lower income households: IMF</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is discussing proposed electricity tariff revisions with Pakistan authorities, the fund said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the burden of the revisions should not fall on middle- or lower-income households.
“The ongoing discussions with the authorities will assess whether the proposed tariff revisions are consistent with these commitments and evaluate their potential impact on macroeconomic stability, including inflation,” it said in its statement.
Pakistan announced a proposed tariff overhaul, which analysts said would lift inflation while easing pressure on industry, as it seeks to meet conditions under its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) as another review of the program approaches.
The EFF is a longer-term IMF loan programme designed to help countries address deep-seated economic weaknesses and medium-term balance-of-payments problems.
Electricity carries significant weight in Pakistan’s consumer price index, making tariff adjustments highly sensitive at a time when inflation, though sharply lower than its near-40% peak in 2023, remains a key political and economic pressure point.
Pakistan’s power sector has long been weighed down by circular debt, a chain of unpaid bills and subsidies that builds up across generation companies, distributors and the government, prompting repeated tariff increases under IMF-backed reforms since 2023.
The accumulation of power sector circular debt has been contained within programme targets, supported by improved performance on recoveries and loss prevention, the Fund added.</p><small>2026-02-14 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141016127299ec0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973164/indian-national-pleads-guilty-in-plot-to-kill-sikh-leader-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Indian national pleads guilty in plot to kill Sikh leader in US</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to plotting the assassination of Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, the US Justice Department said on Friday.
Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta, 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot.
He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29.
According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav, who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large.

The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan.
Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman.
Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place.
In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice.
An FBI official described the case as an example of “transnational repression”.
The case comes amid wider tensions between India and Western governments over alleged threats against Sikh separatists abroad.
Canada has separately accused India of involvement in the 2023 killing of another Sikh leader outside a temple in British Columbia — allegations New Delhi has denied.
Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and later extradited to the United States.</p><small>2026-02-14 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1408471755e7d41.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973158/pakistani-american-found-dead-in-washington-with-blunt-force-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani-American found dead in Washington with blunt-force injuries</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: A small apartment fire in the US capital earlier this week led firefighters to a grim discovery inside a Northwest residence, where a Pakistani American man was found dead with blunt-force and thermal injuries.
Washington Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded at approximately 3:33am on Wednesday to a report of smoke in a hallway in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue NW. Firefighters entered an apartment, extinguished a small fire, and found an adult male unconscious and not breathing.
The victim was later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as 40-year-old Syed Hammad Hussain. Officials said he showed signs of blunt-force trauma as well as thermal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene after responders found no signs consistent with life.
The apartment is located near Logan Circle, a busy residential area about 1.1 miles northwest of the White House.
In an official statement issued on Friday, police said that following an initial assessment, the matter was referred to police and taken over by homicide detectives. As of Friday, no suspects had been identified.
Investigators are reviewing security camera footage from a neighbouring building. Sources familiar with the investigation told local media the footage shows Hussain entering the building with three other individuals, including a possible woman, shortly before the fire. The same individuals were later seen running from the building.
Authorities have appealed to the public for information and urged anyone with knowledge of the incident to contact police. The Metropolitan Police Department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
The Hussain family is from Lahore and is settled in Washington.  The funeral prayer service for Hammad Hussain is scheduled for 12:30pm on Saturday at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia.</p><small>2026-02-14 03:53</small></div><hr>
