<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18070808c834b5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955653/un-security-council-adopts-us-resolution-on-gaza-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council adopts US resolution on Gaza peace plan</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday voted to adopt a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and authorising an international stabilisation force for the Palestinian enclave.
Israel and Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution is seen as vital to legitimising a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.
Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained — notable given earlier signals that Moscow might veto the text.
The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.
It also authorises the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.
Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annex to the resolution.
Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass.
After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision “an historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region.
“Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely.
He emphasized that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.”
Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.
“Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of fighting, sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced.
That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel.
“Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.
Pakistan votes in favour of resolution to ‘stop bloodshed’
Meanwhile, Pakistan, which voted in favour of the US resolution, said it did so in order to halt the fighting, protect civilians, and reinforce a ceasefire that could open the way to humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave.
Speaking after the UNSC adopted the measure, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said Islamabad backed the plan with one overriding purpose: “To stop the bloodshed, to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, to maintain the ceasefire, and to secure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.”
 






He said Pakistan’s vote was guided by the position of the Palestinians, the Arab Group, and the eight-nation Arab-Islamic grouping — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and Türkiye — which endorsed Trump’s initiative earlier this year.
“Our vote has been guided by the position of Palestine and the Arab Group,” he said, adding that the joint engagement was aimed at ending the conflict, ensuring humanitarian access, preventing displacement, and supporting “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
The ambassador noted that Pakistan worked actively during negotiations, supporting Arab amendments and proposing its own changes to ensure the text aligned with “international legitimacy” on the Palestinian question.
He welcomed the inclusion of some proposals, such as the explicit call for maintaining the ceasefire and the requirement for regular reporting to the UNSC, but said several critical issues remained unaddressed.
“A clear political path to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, the central role of the Palestinian Authority in governance and reconstruction, and enhanced involvement of the UN … are crucial aspects,” he said.
“We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity,” he added.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent policy that any peace initiative must lead to a sovereign, independent and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He underscored that existing UNSC resolutions “remain fully valid,” cautioning that the new resolution should not “alter or diminish” the body of established international law on the conflict.
He stressed that the right to self-determination is “inherent and unconditional … and cannot be subjected to any conditions”.
The ambassador said the proposed Board of Peace must remain a temporary oversight mechanism whose mandate expires in 2027 unless renewed.
“Executive and administrative authority in Gaza must remain with the Palestinians through a Palestinian Committee,” he added.
He insisted that the Palestinian Authority must play a central role in governance and reconstruction.
“Peace cannot be achieved by bypassing the Palestinians. There must be an end to policies that undermine and weaken the Palestinian Authority,“ he said.
Talking about the ISF, Ahmad said it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority.
He warned that unilateral violations of the ceasefire could “threaten and thwart the entire process,” and emphasised that the ISF’s mandate would only be effective “once there is complete Israeli withdrawal”.
Referring to the scale of devastation in Gaza, the ambassador said more than 69,000 Palestinians had been killed over the past two years.
A “ray of hope,” he said, had emerged with the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh in October — where Egypt, Qatar, Türkiye and the United States signed the peace agreement that underpins the current plan.
The UN envoy urged the international community to uphold its responsibilities and support a credible, time-bound process towards Palestinian statehood. He stressed that there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement” and that the territorial contiguity of the West Bank and Gaza was essential for a viable state.
Looking ahead, he said the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people must play central roles in governance, reconstruction and institution-building.
At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people.
“Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation.</p><small>2025-11-18 05:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18103222af80dde.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955694/police-step-up-search-and-strike-operations-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Police step up search and strike operations in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Police have intensified search and strike operations in Lower South Waziristan keeping in view the recent security situation and emerging threats in the region.
As part of these measures, District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Tahir Shah Wazir visited various localities here on Monday and reviewed effectiveness of the ongoing operations.
He inspected security arrangements at multiple units, checkpoints and police installations, expressing satisfaction over the preparedness of the force. He met officers and personnel on duty.
Speaking to police personnel, the DPO said that the prevailing security environment demanded utmost vigilance from every officer. Even minor negligence could lead to severe consequences, he said.
 
 

He also inspected surrounding residential areas, streets and all entry and exit points during his visit to police lines in Sholam. He directed relevant officers to keep strict watch on any suspicious movement and ensure that rapid response mechanisms were in place to deal with potential threats.
Mr Wazir also reviewed surveillance system installed at checkpoints and on the premises of DPO office. He examined live and recorded footage of the cameras monitoring internal and external routes.
He instructed the monitoring staff to keep all cameras fully functional, maintain continuous surveillance and promptly report any unusual activity. He directed them to keep the monitoring room active round-the-clock.
The DPO arranged special briefings for officers and personnel deployed at various checkpoints. He ordered thorough checking of all vehicles and individuals, saying that the verification process must be comprehensive and effective. He instructed policemen to remain prepared for swift and coordinated action in case of any emergency.
He said that modern technology, improved policing strategies and community cooperation were essential for establishing lasting peace in the district.
The DPO reaffirmed the commitment of police force to maintaining law and order in the district. “Ensuring sustainable peace and security in the district remains our foremost priority. Police force is fully committed, professionally prepared and dedicated to safeguarding people,” he said.

“I will say that we will be doing that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We’ll be selling the F-35s.”
A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington’s definition of maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
 






Saudi Arabia has requested to buy as many as 48 F-35 fighters, a potential multibillion-dollar deal that has cleared a key Pentagon hurdle ahead of bin Salman’s visit, Reuters reported early this month.
The Saudis have long been interested in Lockheed Martin’s LMT.N fighter.
A senior White House official told Reuters before Trump spoke that the president wanted to talk to the crown prince about the jets, “then we’ll make a determination”.
Personal appeal
Saudi Arabia, the largest customer for US arms, has sought the fighter for years as it looks to modernise its air force and counter regional threats, particularly from Iran.
The kingdom’s renewed push for what would constitute two squadrons comes as the Trump administration has signaled openness to deepening defence cooperation with Riyadh.
The Saudi Air Force flies a mix of fighter aircraft, including Boeing BA.N F-15s, European Tornados and Typhoons.
Saudi Arabia made a direct appeal to buy the jets earlier this year to Trump.
The Pentagon’s policy department worked on the potential transaction for months, US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had previously told Reuters.
Washington weighs weapons sales to the Middle East in a way that ensures Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge”. This guarantees that Israel gets more advanced US weapons than regional Arab states.
The F-35, built with stealth technology that allows it to evade enemy detection, is considered the world’s most advanced fighter jet. Israel has operated the aircraft for nearly a decade, building multiple squadrons, and remains the only Middle Eastern country to possess the weapons system.
The F-35 issue has also been intertwined with broader diplomatic efforts. The Biden administration previously explored providing F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a comprehensive deal that would have included Riyadh normalising relations with Israel, though those efforts ultimately stalled.
Congressional scrutiny could pose challenges to any F-35 sale. Lawmakers previously questioned arms deals with Riyadh following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some members of Congress remain wary of deepening military cooperation with the kingdom.</p><small>2025-11-18 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691b7c6ead0f9.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955713/pm-promises-revival-of-karachi-circular-railway-with-sindh-govts-help' target='_blank'><strong>PM promises revival of Karachi Circular Railway with Sindh govt’s help</strong></a><br><p>• On CM Murad’s request, Shehbaz assures inclusion of Karachi Circular Railway in CPEC
• Says federal govt to work with all provinces to extend railway network to Central Asia
• Inaugurates new Shalimar Express, upgraded CIP lounge at Cantt Station
• Praises Hanif Abbasi for modernising Pakistan Railways
KARACHI: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday that the federal government in collaboration with the Sindh government would revive the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), hoping the long-delayed project would soon become a reality.
He also promised to upgrade and modernise all railway stations across the province and the country.
He said that the digitisation and modernisation of Pakistan Railways and the provision of state-of-the-art facilities would play a key role in strengthening the national economy.
The prime minister expressed these views while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the new Shalimar Express and the newly upgraded waiting rooms, CIP lounge at Karachi Cantonment Railway Station.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and others were present on the occasion.
Responding to CM Shah’s request to include the KCR project in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the prime minister assured full cooperation, calling it a vital initiative.
He said he had flagged the KCR project at every international forum and “we would jointly revive it as this project was inevitable for the people of Karachi”.
He hoped this project would soon become a reality.
The PM said the Shalimar Express running between Karachi and Lahore has been converted into a new, upgraded train.
He described Karachi as not only the economic hub but also the heart of Pakistan.
‘54 railway stations modernised’
The prime minister said that 54 railway stations had already been modernised.
He said that soon after assuming office, Railways Minister Abbasi worked diligently to modernise the railway system. “After revamping Lahore Railway Station, now Karachi Cantt Station has also been upgraded with contemporary facilities.”
He said that all railway stations in Sindh would be modernised in coordination with the provincial government to ensure better travel facilities for the passengers.
He said like Sindh and Punjab, such coordination with the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan should be evolved, which would ultimate make the railways the best transport system of this region.
He said the federal government would work with all provinces to extend the railway network to Central Asia, specifically highlighting the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway line project.
He reiterated that cooperation with all provincial governments would continue to ensure modernisation across the railway network and help stabilise the economy.
He said the railway’s freight system was also being organised.
The PM said the federal and Sindh governments hade a partnership to provide transportation for Thar Coal, with both governments investing 50 per cent each in the project.
He assured that all required funds would be released in this regard so that the set targets of the projects could be achieved.
He also emphasised reviving the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail route, saying this would boost the economy.
He noted that Mr Abbasi had initiated discussions with the Asian Development Bank for a $2 billion loan to further upgrade the railway line from Karachi to Rohri. He said that eventually it would be connected to the Reko Diq project.
Praising the services of Mr Abbasi, he said once all stations, big or small, are upgraded he would recommend a presidential award for him.
Calling him the hero of today’s ceremony, he congratulated the minister for transforming the outdated railway system.
Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Mr Abbasi said that significant improvements were achieved in just eight months, including the modernisation of Karachi Cantt Station and the renewal of the Shalimar Express.
He added that Rs1 billion was being spent on upgrading the Rohri Station, while work was also underway at Karachi City Station.
Mr Abbasi said that 14 trains were being outsourced under a government policy and railway hospitals and schools were also being given to private administration, while ensuring full protection for railway employees. “Work on the ML-1 project is also progressing,” he added.
Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah welcomed the prime minister to Karachi and reaffirmed full cooperation from the provincial government.
He appealed to the PM for federal support in establishing the KCR project. “A large-scale project like the KCR cannot be completed by the Sindh government alone,” he said.
He reaffirmed the Sindh government’s commitment to fully cooperate with federal authorities and the railways to ensure the successful implementation of the project.
He expressed gratitude to the PM and Minister Abbasi and emphasised that upgrading railway lines and branches was a positive development for Sindh’s residents.
The CM Shah pointed out that, until the Karachi-Hyderabad motorway is completed, train travel remains the most viable public transport option.
He called for expedited federal efforts to finish the motorway, reiterating that improved regional connectivity will greatly benefit thousands of commuters daily.
Earlier, the prime minister inaugurated the new Shalimar Express at Karachi Cantt Station by cutting the ribbon and unveiling the plaque. He visited the upgraded waiting area, CIP lounge, state-of-the-art dining hall and computerised ticketing system.
Mr Abbasi briefed the prime minister regarding modernisation and upgradation of the railways.
The ceremony was also attended by foreign diplomats and parliamentarians, senior officers from the federal as well as provincial governments.

In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
First, an IBO was conducted by security forces in Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 05:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691babd069027.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955788/opposition-has-homework-to-do' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition has homework to do</strong></a><br><p>LESSONS from the Bihar elections have domestic implications, and they will be studied in the neighbourhood. The call to war Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave from the poll-bound state in April in response to terror killings in distant Pahalgam, was seen as aimed at producing a favourable electoral outcome in last week’s poll verdict. In case the war cry, followed by a four-day flare-up with Pakistan, did help in the stupendous verdict, would the victory for Modi’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar fuel more tensions on the border or would they abate now that the run-in with Pakistan had served its electoral purpose. Or would success in Bihar prompt repetition in crucial West Bengal polls next year?
The narrative from Modi supporters and his rivals is that one or two previous military events did help the prime minister electorally. It is claimed that the Pulwama attack and the aerial skirmish it set off with Pakistan brought rich dividends for Modi in the 2019 elections. Never mind the dubious optics the skirmishes produced to contradict the belief — an Indian pilot’s embarrassing capture in Pakistan in the post-Pulwama episode and widespread claims, not least by President Donald Trump, of Pakistan shooting down several Indian planes in the subsequent Operation Sindoor/Bunyanum Marsoos engagement. The optics were airbrushed or recast by pliable TV channels as major victories.
Dampening the enthusiasm for war cries and their electoral linkages is the example of Manmohan Singh. He won a second term while not raising a militarist finger in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage of November 2008. On the contrary, he changed his home minister and probed peaceful ways to resolve the terror problem with Pakistan. Singh agreed to discuss Balochistan alongside the Kashmir issue in his meeting with his Pakistani counterpart in Egypt. The proposal was shot down by the deep state on both sides.
Be that as it may, the opposition in India is crying foul at the Bihar results. The Congress looks scandalised by “the unprecedented 90 per cent strike rate” scored by the BJP and its allies, a reference to the number of seats won against the number of seats contested by the NDA. It says former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi won 404 of the 514 seats the Congress contested for the Lok Sabha after his mother’s assassination in October 1984. But even he didn’t get the strike rate of last week’s Bihar results for the NDA. The implication is that there was foul play at the hustings.

India’s opposition parties might want to figure out their priorities at the outset.

There are two problems here that the opposition should tackle. If the election results were an outcome of rigging, as is alleged, it is not all bad news. It shows India at least doesn’t face a threat from fascism given that fascism rides popular support, which the BJP needs to scrounge around for. As for military action on the other hand, if it begins to tweak electoral results, a militarised polity could easily become fertile ground for Hindutva to strike deeper roots. In either case, what is the opposition’s strategy to take on the entrenched right wing under Modi’s watch.
Rahul Gandhi and his team have carried out deep investigations into some serious electoral malpractices in vogue under the Modi regime. The election commission has been accused of connivance. The probe threw up compelling findings, a classic one being the case of Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, whose photos featured in voters’ lists across India. Having done the homework in a higher cause, Gandhi’s party promptly sullied its image by haggling over seat shares with the local ally. It hurt both.
 
 

Bereft of context, the result looks unremarkable. Bihar’s main opposition party, Lalu Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal, pouched the highest percentage of vote share but only to win a paltry 25 seats in the 243-member assembly. With 23pc of the total votes cast, the RJD is clearly but strangely ahead of Modi’s ally, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United, JDU) with 19.25pc.
The BJP got 20.08pc vote share. Yet, the BJP and JDU won 89 and 85 seats respectively. Likewise, the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen with 1.85pc vote share took five seats while the Congress with 8.71pc managed to get just six.
Such anomalies were at play with the left’s performance too and has been the feature of many an Indian election, a commentary on the country’s first past the post system. Indira Gandhi was ‘routed’ in 1977 by the Janata Party with a difference of 2pc votes. She took 40.98pc, and the opposition alliance had nothing more than 43pc. Moreover — and this is important for Rahul Gandhi to note — in her rout, Mrs Gandhi still had 154 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha whereas the Congress in recent outings has struggled to do half as well. And this is what needs to be understood and explained by the struggling behemoth the Congress has become.
The BJP under Modi’s leadership is pursuing power at any cost — dismantling state governments with defections in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, winning elsewhere with questionable methods under the election commission’s nose. What then is the most important task before opposition parties? They might want to figure out their priorities at the outset. Should the left, for example, derail Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal or see the back of the BJP first? Similar sacrifices are needed in Kerala to keep the BJP out.
Also, do the opposition really believe they are taking part in a genuine democratic event with elections? Or are today’s elections mere choreographed formalities with a predetermined outcome? The complete subjugation of the election commission provides a most visible clue. The opposition had pondered a second independence movement. Should they hit the road as Gandhi would? And like Gandhi, perhaps talk to Pakistan? The most nationalist opposition party can’t beat the BJP on its militarist turf.

• Connecting Central and South Asia markets ‘central objective’ for both nations
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided on Monday to establish a joint committee comprising the drug regulatory authorities of both countries and the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Association (PMA) to fast-track solutions aimed at boosting pharma-related trade between the two nations.The agreement was reached during the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Cooperation’s 8th Review Session, chaired by Haroon Akhtar Khan, the special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) on industries and production.
The meeting was attended by Uz­­bek Ambassador Alisher Takhta­yev, as well as senior representatives from the federal and provincial governments, the Special Investment Facilitation Council, the business community, and diplomatic missions.
During the meeting, both sides held comprehensive discussions on expanding bilateral cooperation in key sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, surgical instruments, mining, and information technology.
 






In line with the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan is accelerating its efforts to achieve the target of $2 billion in bilateral trade with Uzbekistan.
Mr Takhtayev reaffirmed his country’s resolve to deepen regional integration, stating that connecting the markets of Central and South Asia remained a central objective for both nations.
It was decided that a body should be set up that includes the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, its Uzbek counterpart and the PMA to bolster the pharma trade between the two countries.  The issue of slow certification of Pakistani medicines in Uzbekistan was raised by pharmaceutical stakeholders. In response, SAPM Khan assured the stakeholders that the certification process would be expedited.
Aviation ties
Aviation connectivity was another significant point of discussion.
The Uzbek ambassador expressed his interest in initiating direct flights from Karachi to his country, highlighting the potential for enhanced trade and tourism.
SAPM Khan emphasised that Pakistan-Uzbekistan air links were essential for unlocking commercial and travel opportunities. He added that Uzbekistan could serve as a new gateway for travel between the Gulf region and Europe.
Banking cooperation
The meeting also underscored the urgent need to strengthen banking cooperation between the two countries. The Uzbek side pointed out that the existing banking barriers were affecting trade transactions. Pakistan reiterated that financial integration was essential to sustaining economic cooperation.
Representatives of the State Bank of Pakistan assured the other side that banking challenges would soon be resolved and shared that several local banks were ready to facilitate bilateral trade.
It was announced that the National Bank of Pakistan would open a branch in Uzbekistan, enabling smoother financial operations for businesses on both sides.

The party has challenged the notification issued on Oct 24 by interior ministry that placed the party in the First Schedule of proscribed organisations under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal in this regard was ratified by the federal cabinet.
Since the party under the regulations has the right to appeal to a review committee comprising interior and law ministry officers within 30 days, the TLP moved the appeal before the expiry of the deadline.
 
 

The petition argues the SRO No 2011(I)/2025 was issued without due consideration of earlier administrative and legal actions. It contains supporting documents annexed with the application including the 2021 notification of proscription, its restoration as a political entity by the ECP, the subsequent notification removing TLP from the proscribed list, and an ‘agreement’ between the federal government and the party.
Advocates Burhan Moazzam Malik and Sajjad Akbar Abbasi, who filed the application, maintain the ministry’s latest move contradicts earlier commitments of the government and established legal processes. The interior ministry is expected to examine the petition and accompanying record before deciding to uphold, amend, or withdraw the October notification. If the petition is rejected, the TLP has the right to move the apex court.

Of course, what is less mourned, perhaps, is that the second pillar, parliament, is no longer standing upright either. Having been weakened over the years, it no longer functions as an independent branch either. It sits, stands and runs around in circles on cue — from the leadership of the political parties and the known unknowns. There were hints of it during the passage of the 18th Amendment but the slide began in earnest later — from the lightening-fast approval given to Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s extension to the present when constitutional amendments are passed within days. The ‘public representatives’ are led by the Pied Piper to the ‘ayes’ gallery when the vote is needed and there is little choice in the matter. And it doesn’t matter if they are sitting on the treasury benches or are in the opposition.
The executive may have had its hand strengthened by the recent legislation, but simply on paper. But its ability to make decisions is now a thing of the past. The only reason it is perhaps not discussed much is that its helplessness is hidden behind closed doors. In private rooms, it is hard to say who is chairing meetings or making the decisions. The capitulation is just not as public as in the case of the legislature even though the results are visible to all.
Indeed, there is little hope that any of the three pillars of the state are intact.

There is little hope that any of the three pillars of the state are intact.

But in the land of the pure, political theories remain just that — theories. Here, the pillars of the state weaken and crumble, straining just to stay upright but in our everyday lingo, the word ‘state’ is used to denote our respect and our acknowledgement of the power and influence of one institution. At times, we use the word also to concede our own vulnerability. But that is another story.
The state hasn’t been left untouched either. The 27th Amendment has brought sweeping reforms to the structure of the armed forces as well. Among other things, the new legislation has discontinued the joint chief position and introduced a new CDF, a position which will be held by the chief of army staff, who now appears to be far more than the ‘first among equals’. At the same time, the tenure of all services chiefs has been increased from three to five years. The head — COAS/CDF — has also been given lifetime immunity, like the president.
 
 

It is being said this will help prepare the armed forces for modern warfare and allow for the kind of coordination that was perhaps not possible earlier. Time and again, those who claim to understand how warfare works argue this, but their language explains little to those of us not in the know. These new changes will bring or improve combat readiness, synergy, multi-domain integration — though what this means in practical terms remains unclear to those of us who have never worn a uniform.
It is easier, however, to understand the far simpler concerns or worries that are being put forward.
There are fears that these changes may allow for centralisation of power in a single post/individual that is also above the law. Of course, some can argue that strong men who claimed to speak for or on behalf of the state were always above the law — the trial of Musharraf is a case in point — but now this has been put down on paper. But in a country such as Pakistan where checks on the ruling elite have always remained weak, the precedent being set by offering immunity to any government official is worrying. Others will want to follow suit in the future, as it will encourage decision-making without any fear of accountability.
 
 

Second, and perhaps more importantly, questions have been raised about what this will mean for the other two forces and their ability to make decisions or have their views heard if the perception of equality between all three forces is not acknowledged on paper. This, it is feared, will impact not just the morale but also decision-making.
How will it impact decisions about resource allocation, or decisions taken during times of conflict? Will the other services chiefs still be able to make their voice heard, ask some? Here, some insiders have mentioned the 2019 skirmish with India where they claim the then chief of army staff was outvoted when deciding the response to India. This account has been questioned, but as an anecdote it does urge more clarity on how decisions will be made. Will collegial decision-making, which some say has been at work till now, continue once the new structures are in place?
These questions are being asked partly because there is no transparent debate on the changes. If the discussions were open, such questions would not fester.
But beyond the powers, in Pakistan, there is always the worry about how the politics of any changes will play out. A case in point is the frenzied politicking over key non-political appointments as we have seen in the recent past. And one wonders that if powers are further centralised in new positions, whether it will encourage newcomers and aspirants to lobby in new and more aggressive ways for key positions as well as exceptional promotions. The long-term impact of this will not just weaken civilian actors and institutions; this is not one-way traffic.
In a fast-fragmenting state and society where legislation is being used to hollow out institutions such as the judiciary, any new factors that can further add to centralisation of power and increased politicking should worry us all — till some solid answers are provided.

• Lawyers organise rally in Lahore, vow to announce next course of action soon
KARACHI/LAHORE: Days after the 27th Amendment came into effect, a petition landed in the Sindh High Court for its annulment, while a Lahore High Court judge hearing a similar plea recused himself from hearing the case due to “personal reasons”.
On the other hand, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) or­­ganised a rally in Lahore against the new amendment and vowed to hold weekly protests against the recent constitutional tweaks that established ‘a court above the Su­preme Court’, namely the Fed­eral Constitutional Court (FCC).
In the SHC, the petition filed by Barrister Ali Tahir made the federal government, the FCC chief justice and the FCC judges respondents, asking the court to declare the 27th Amendment “unconstitutional”.
 
 

The petitioner said that the recent amendment contemplated the establishment of a separate FCC and curtailment or transfer of the existing jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the high courts conferred under the articles 184 (3) and 199 of the Constitution.
“Such an attempt, if permitted to proceed, would fundamentally alter the Constitutional framework, destroy the independence of the judiciary, violate the doctrine of separation of powers and extinguish the citizens rights of access to justice and judicial review guaranteed by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,” the petitioner said. According to the petition, the FCC and the position of the FCC chief justice could not have been “constitutionally created”.
“It is inherently ultra vires, as no parallel or superior court can be established above the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Such construct would violate the basic structure of the Constitution,” it added.
Regarding the notifications throu­­gh which FCC judges were appoin­t­­ed, the petitioner claimed that “those who are pretending to hold public office under these shady notifications should also be treated as respondents in a writ of quo warranto. It is obvious that the executive wanted to build a tailor-made court for itself, which is why it rammed these notifications through within hours and filled every seat like it owned the Constitution.”
He added that out of 24 judges of the Supreme Court, FCC CJ Justice Aminduddin Khan was at number four in the seniority list, while Jus­ti­­ce Hassan Azhar Rizvi ranked ninth, Justice Aamer Farooq ranked 21st, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi ranked 23rd. It claimed that these appointments raised significant questions abo­­­ut the process, timing, and intent.
 
 

The petitioner argued that the Supreme Court itself in multiple pre­cedents, including the Attock Cem­ent case, affirmed that a regular bench of the high court retained the authority to issue declaratory relief and enforce constitutional rights.
“Any attempt to withdraw or reassign this jurisdiction to special ben­ches, particularly those constituted through executive influence, is not only unconstitutional but void ab initio. It violates the doctrine of separation of powers and undermines the principle of judicial independen­­ce, which is an essential feature of the Constitution and cannot be ame­nded even by a two-third(s) majority.”
The petition urged to strike down the amendment and subsequent action. The petitioner also moved an application before the court, asking the SHC chief justice for a full bench or larger bench comprising five senior-most judges of the SHC to hear the petition.
LHC judge recuses
Meanwhile, Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal of the Lahore High Court on Monday recused himself from hearing two separate petitions challenging the 27th Amend­ment to the Constitution.
The judge requested the chief justice to fix them before any other ap­­propriate bench, citing personal reasons.
The first petition was filed by lawyers Munir Ahmad and Mian Shab­bir Ismail through Advocate Azhar Siddique, arguing that the amendment conflicts with the basic structure and spirit of the 1973 Consti­tution. The petition alleged that the amendment distorted the country’s 60-year judicial history and tradition, maintaining that a federal constitutional court was never part of the original constitutional scheme.
The petition further argued that the current National Assembly was not a “true constituent assembly” and therefore lacked the authority to introduce such major constitutional changes. In the second plea, a citizen, Hassan Latif, challenged the 27th Amendment. The petition contended that radical changes introduced by the amendment contradicted the preamble of the Constit­ution and aimed at curtailing the powers of the Supreme Court.
LHCBA meeting
The Lahore High Court Bar Asso­ciation members held a general hou­se meeting followed by a rally agai­nst the 27th Amendment. LHCBA President Asif Nissoana presided over the meeting, which was also attended by Lahore Bar Association (LBA) President Mubashir Rehman and other lawyer leaders. During the meeting, the lawyers rejected the 27th Amendment, alleging that it weakened the Supreme Court.
Mr Niswana said a parallel constitutional court had been created under the amendment, rendering the Supreme Court ineffective. He claimed that there was no court left to protect the fundamental rights of the people. He announced that the LHCBA and the LBA would hold meetings and rallies every Thursday and a lawyers’ action committee would announce the next course of action, he added.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also addressed the meeting, saying the time had come to stand up once again as there was no other option left. He questioned the legality of the appointment of the head of the federal constitutional court made by the prime minister.
After the meeting, dozens of lawyers took out a rally from GPO Chowk to the State Bank of Pakistan on the Mall.

Sheikh Hasina, who has been living in India after fleeing her homeland in August 2024, has termed the verdict “biased” and delivered by a “rigged tribunal”. Ironically, the court that convicted her — the International Crimes Tribunal — was set up by Sheikh Hasina herself. During her rule, it sent several of her opponents, mostly from the Bangladesh chapter of Jamaat-i-Islami and the opposition BNP, to the gallows for their supposed role in the 1971 violence. Many people rightly described those trials as unfair. Today, Sheikh Hasina appears to have become a victim of the very institutions she had created to eliminate her opponents.
While the fairness of the trial and the hasty manner in which it was conducted can be questioned, there can be little argument that Sheikh Hasina’s dispensation had become increasingly autocratic over the years. Cronies were enriched, while opponents were hounded. Democratic principles were eschewed in favour of a cult of personality surrounding Sheikh Hasina, her father Sheikh Mujeeb and her party the Awami League.
 
 

Sheikh Hasina’s repressive methods culminated in an explosion of popular rage last year, which eventually led to the toppling of her government, and her self-exile in India — a close ally for decades. It is clear that Sheikh Hasina’s government unleashed excesses on protesters during the 2024 unrest; she herself admitted that “we lost control of the situation”. Earlier this year, her party was banned, while her late father, once revered as ‘Bangabandhu’, also became a target of the protesters’ ire.
Over five decades since East Pakistan became Bangladesh, political stability still eludes that country. Whatever economic progress Bangladesh had made during Sheikh Hasina’s rule was overtaken by her repression of dissent, and relentless assaults on the opposition. Today, Bangladesh stands at a crucial juncture. Elections are scheduled for next year, and the interim authorities must ensure that full democratic rule is restored at the earliest. For elections to be credible, the Awami League must be allowed to contest.
It should be remembered that the 2024 elections — boycotted by the opposition — that returned Sheikh Hasina to power were not considered fair, which was a major factor behind the downfall of her regime. That is why all political parties must be allowed to contest the next polls to establish the credibility of the process. Those officials guilty of crimes must face justice. But if the process is coloured by vengeance including extreme punishments like the death penalty — which this paper opposes — it will only perpetuate instability. Mature states balance demands for justice with the need for reconciliation.

• Researchers from Carnegie Institution for Science find photosynthesis was taking place 800 million years earlier than previously thought
• New technology could ‘revolutionise search for extra-terrestrial life’
ISLAMABAD: Pairing cutting-edge chemistry with artificial intelligence (AI), a multidisciplinary team of scientists on Monday published fresh chemical evidence of Earth’s earliest life concealed in 3.3-billion-year-old rocks and molecular evidence that oxygen-producing photosynthesis was occurring over 800 million years earlier than previously documented.
In a ground-breaking study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from the Carnegie Institution for Science and several partner universities and institutions analysed over 400 samples, including ancient sediments, fossils, modern plants and animals, and even meteorites, to see if life’s signature still exists in rocks long after the original biomolecules are gone.
Using high-tech chemical analysis to break down both organic and inorganic materials, Michael L. Wong, Anirudh Prabhu, and colleagues trained AI to recognise chemical ‘fingerprints’ left behind by life — signals that can still be detected even after billions of years of geological wear and tear.
According to Carnegie Science, the results prove the possibility of distinguishing materials of biological origin (like microbes, plants and animals) from materials of non-living origin (like meteoritic or synthetic carbon) with over 90 per cent accuracy.
These methods teased out chemical patterns unique to biology in rocks as old as 3.3 billion years. Previously, no such traces had been found in rocks older than about 1.7 billion years. The results, therefore, roughly double the window of time in which organic molecules preserved in rocks can reveal useful information about the physiology and evolutionary relationships of their original organisms.
The work also provides molecular evidence that oxygen-producing photosynthesis (the process used by plants, algae and many microorganisms to harness sunlight) was at work at least 2.5 billion years ago. This finding extends the chemical record of photosynthesis preserved in carbon molecules by over 800 million years.
Besides helping find evidence of Earth’s earliest life, this work advances a potential way to identify traces of life beyond our planet.
Dr Robert Hazen, senior staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science, said: “Think of it like showing thousands of jigsaw puzzle pieces to a computer and asking whether the original scene was a flower or a meteorite.”
“Our results show that ancient life leaves behind more than fossils; it leaves chemical ‘echoes.’ Using machine learning, we can now reliably interpret these echoes for the first time.”
One key insight was that age makes detection harder. Younger samples from the last 500 million years retained strong biotic signals.
The results suggest that machine learning applied to degraded organic matter can help resolve long-standing debates about the evolution of life on Earth in deep time.
This method could also assist in the search for signs of extraterrestrial life. If AI can detect biotic “fingerprints” on Earth that survived billions of years, the same technique might work on Martian rocks or even samples from Jupiter’s icy moon Europa.

• Seven courtrooms arranged on IHC floors
• Three benches hear several cases on first working day
ISLAMABAD: After the swearing-in of two more judges, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) finally commenced operations on Monday, hearing a number of cases within the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises.
The day began with the oath-taking ceremony of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah inside the conference room on the ground floor of the IHC building on Constitution Avenue. The oath was administered by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, bringing the court’s existing strength to seven judges.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Earlier, the FCC chief justice had told the media that the total sanctioned strength of the court would be 13 judges. Seven courtrooms have been arranged for FCC judges on different floors of the IHC building.
After the ceremony, the formal proceedings commenced with the recitation of the Holy Quran at the main FCC courtroom situated on the first floor. Since the FCC’s arrangements are not yet complete, IHC Courtroom No. 2 has been converted into the main courtroom of the FCC chief justice, with a printed A-4 page affixed at the entrance to designate it as such.
Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar will continue holding court in his original Courtroom No. 1, located above the FCC’s main courtroom.
Formal proceedings began at 10:12am, with Bench-I hearing around five cases in half an hour. During the hearing, those present in the courtroom could hear discomforting sounds such as the dragging of furniture.
“With the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) refusing to hand over its building, and the FCC already reeling from myriad teething problems due to sharing its establishment with the IHC, this is the only court in the country without a formal building of its own,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity. He added that even the rooms allocated for law officers have yet to be refurbished.
He further confided that there was a strong possibility that the IHC may revert to its old G-10 premises early next year, possibly in January, since litigants face difficulties entering the Red Zone to pursue their cases. The move would also ease logistical issues for lawyers who must shuttle between the district courts and the high court to file bail applications, appeals, etc.
There is also a possibility that a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) may be called soon to consider the confirmation of Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, who was elevated as an acting judge of the Supreme Court on Feb 14 this year.
The counsel also disclosed that during hearings in one FCC courtroom, a lawyer was told that the FCC should be their first priority and that they should appear before it before attending cases at the Supreme Court.
Cases’ hearing
On Monday, three different FCC benches heard cases. Bench-I comprised FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah. Bench-II included Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, while Bench-III consisted of Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech.
Meanwhile, Bench-I, while taking up a case relating to the change of status of an amenity plot, stayed the Aug 26, 2025 Sindh High Court judgement and issued notices to various respondents, adjourning further proceedings until Nov 27.
Declaring the matter a public-interest case, the FCC also directed the SHC not to proceed with a contempt of court case against the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which some respondents had moved before the high court.
The KMC, through its mayor, had challenged the SHC decision that declared void and illegal the corporation’s May 19 resolution allowing public-private partnership agreements under rental arrangements to initiate commercial activities on nine different amenity plots.
In the first round of litigation, the petitioners had questioned the conversion of nine Karachi amenity plots into sports grounds for commercial use, for which exorbitant usage fees were being charged.
The plots include Jheel Park, Hill Park, Umer Sharif Park, Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim, KMC Sports Complex, Hosh Muhammad Sheedi Park, St-4 Clifton Block 2, St-15 Clifton Block 1, and St-19 Clifton Block 1.
The petitioners argued that the SHC judgement was unwarranted in law and had created an administrative and executive vacuum. They contended that the verdict was based on presumptions and relied on precedents not applicable to the present issue. Most importantly, they argued, it failed to consider the contours of public purpose as presently relevant to ground realities.

The latest data issued by the State Bank on Monday showed that the country posted a CAD of $733 million in July-October compared with $206m in the same period last year. Another vital change was that October posted a $112m deficit, compared with a $83m surplus in September.
The pressure on the current account is directly related to higher imports, while the exports remained stagnant during the current fiscal year. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the government had relaxed import curbs.
The government is under severe criticism for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years, and financial circles believe it was a deliberate attempt to cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn in FY25, but economic growth remained at 2.6pc, which was later revised to 3pc.

Rising imports and falling exports contributed to poor performance

Experts have been advising the government to ease import restrictions to boost economic growth, as the country has an import-led growth model.
The data shows that imports of goods and services during the first four months of the current fiscal year rose to $24.919bn, up from $22.647bn in the same period last year. However, the export did not show any significant change as the total stood at $13.664bn during July-October compared to $13.041bn in the same period of FY25.
The trade deficit during the 4 months of the current fiscal year was $11.255bn compared to $9.606bn in the same period of FY25.
Despite the higher current account deficit, other external account indicators are supportive of the government. Remittances in October totalled $3.4bn, up from $3.2bn in the preceding month. Overall remittances, compared to last year, increased during the 4 months, which was against policymakers’ expectations. The government expects to receive $40bn remittances in FY26.
At the same time, the expected inflow of $1.2bn from the IMF under the EFF and RSF programmes, and support from the United States for investment, have changed sentiment towards Pakistan. Some analysts believe remittances will rise as a result of the defence pact with Saudi Arabia.
“The current account deficit is the key to the stability of the external account of the country and a basic need for higher foreign exchange reserves that stabilises the exchange rate,” said an analyst. He said that if the current account deficit persists in the first half of the fiscal FY26, it would be damaging to both the economy and the country.

For this purpose, the social safety net has begun distributing free SIMs to as many eligible women.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had directed BISP to introduce this new payment model for its beneficiaries, marking a historic step towards digital financial inclusion.
This initiative is among the largest social protection projects in the world, BISP claimed.
Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson BISP, Senator Rubina Khalid, shared important guidelines regarding the Social Protection Wallet. 
She stated that eligible women must visit their nearest BISP office or designated camp site with their original CNIC and active mobile phone. After biometric verification, they will be 
provided a free mobile SIM, which will be used to activate their Social Protection Wallet.
Senator Rubina Khalid strongly cautioned women not to pay anyone for the SIM, as it is completely free of cost. 
She emphasised that the Social Protection Wallet will be activated on this SIM only by BISP and advised women that they should not 
contact any unauthorised external sources to get it activated.
She added that this new system will make the disbursement of BISP funds more convenient, secure, and transparent.
The chairperson further stated that in future, all BISP instalments and stipends will be transferred exclusively through this social protection wallet, and all payment-related messages will also be received on this particular SIM.
In her message for beneficiaries, she reiterated that “This SIM is not an ordinary SIM, it is a digital wallet that holds your financial power, and must be protected with the same care as your personal purse.”
This project is an important milestone in making Pakistan’s deserving women more empowered and financially independent. 
She advised all eligible women to collect their free SIMs from BISP offices or designated camp sites by December 31.

Last week, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
Speaking to reporters in Chiniot, the PM’s aide said that the amendment would deal with “public issues, such as local bodies, population, the National Finance Commission … health-related issues”.
“There is a need to review how we can better serve the people according to the present needs of the provinces and the Centre,” Sanaullah stated.
“This is being debated and if there is any consensus, then we can bring the 28th Amendment forward,” said the PML-N leader.
Referring to the recent resignations by judges of the Supreme Court and LHC, the PM’s aide said that “those who stepped down did so due to their personal motives”.
He maintained that the parliament has the constitutional right to pass amendments, while judges are meant to protect the laws of the state.
 


The 27th Constitutional Amendment bill was tabled in the Senate on November 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the parliamentary standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The bill proposed the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.
On November 12, the bill was passed by the National Assembly after the introduction of some changes, mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
In the house of 336 members, 224 votes were required to meet the mandatory two-thirds majority for the passage of the bill. The ruling lawmakers cast 234 votes in its favour, while four votes were polled against the bill by the JUI-F members. The JUI-F has 10 MNAs, but only four attended the sitting. The PTI members, meanwhile, boycotted the process by staging a walkout.
The bill, however, was referred back to the Senate due to the fresh changes and was approved after a second round of voting amid the opposition’s protest.</p><small>2025-11-17 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17225117fd0a6aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955667/pakistan-bets-on-ai-to-tackle-smog-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan bets on AI to tackle smog crisis</strong></a><br><p>Lahore, once celebrated as the City of Gardens, now chokes each winter under a grey shroud of smog — its skies thick with toxic haze that has become the city’s defining feature.
Every November, as the monsoon fades, a suffocating layer of smoke and dust engulfs Lahore, India’s capital New Delhi and much of northern South Asia.
The mix of crop burning, vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions drives air pollution to deadly levels, forcing authorities to shut schools, businesses and highways.
This winter, as air quality plummets again, the Punjab government is betting on an unconventional ally to fight back: artificial intelligence (AI).
Authorities say they are deploying one of the region’s most technologically advanced clean-air programmes, with AI systems at the centre of forecasting, enforcement and public response.
 


Some 100 AI-powered air-quality monitoring stations have been established across Punjab, home to nearly 130 million people, according to Punjab Environment Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.
These smart stations continuously analyse pollution data using machine-learning algorithms to predict air-quality surges before they occur. The information feeds into a 24-hour “smog war room” — a real-time climate intelligence hub integrating satellite feeds, ground sensors and international databases.
Aurangzeb told Anadolu that across major industrial and urban centres, 8,500 cameras, drones and thermal sensors are linked to this AI dashboard, tracking emissions from factories and brick kilns. “Each emission source is geo-tagged, QR-coded, and algorithmically assessed for compliance,” she said.
From smoke to smart data
Punjab has also created a specialised Environmental Protection Force (EPF) digitally connected to the AI command centre. When sensors detect an emission spike, nearby EPF units receive automatic alerts and are dispatched with drones and smart devices to verify violations and seal polluting sites.
Another innovation is the deployment of AI-guided anti-smog guns across Lahore, programmed to activate automatically when particulate levels exceed safe limits.
Early pilot tests showed a 70 per cent improvement in air quality in Lahore’s Kahna area within hours of operation, Aurangzeb said.
Citizens are also part of the digital ecosystem. Through the Air Quality Index Punjab app, Green Punjab app and helpline 1373, residents can report pollution sources directly. The system categorises complaints and assigns them automatically — with a reported 96pc closure rate.
Using satellite data from Nasa and Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission, the AI network also detects crop-burning incidents in real time and cross-references them with farm-loan databases to target enforcement.
According to the government, the system has helped reduce stubble burning by 65pc in a year, while in Punjab’s industrial belt, it says 95pc of factories now operate under emission-control systems.
‘No silver bullet’ for smog
 
 

But while AI may be transforming enforcement, experts caution that technology alone cannot solve Pakistan’s deep-rooted pollution crisis.
Air pollution kills an estimated 128,000 Pakistanis each year, according to Fair Finance Pakistan. Analysts say real progress requires cleaner fuels, modern refineries and a shift away from outdated industrial practices.
Imran Saqib Khalid, a climate governance expert in Islamabad, said Lahore’s smog cannot be fixed without tackling its primary sources.
“Vehicular emissions contribute significantly to air pollution in Lahore, which can be addressed through the use of high-quality fuel, along with an improved public transport system,” he told Anadolu.
Pakistan, he said, lacks modern refineries capable of producing cleaner fuel. “Although we have started to import improved-quality fuel, it is not enough to meet our needs.”
Khalid also pointed to the country’s thousands of brick kilns, many of which burn low-quality coal or even old tyres. “Even the so-called ‘zigzag technology’ kilns fail to meet national environmental standards because of poor-quality fuel,” he said, adding that zigzag firing, while efficient in theory, “cannot deliver results without fuel reform”.
“Air pollution is a complex issue but it has been addressed elsewhere in the world. It will take time and effort — there is no silver bullet solution,” he said. “It cannot be done through surface-level measures such as smog guns and smog towers.”
Environmentalists acknowledge that Punjab’s use of AI marks a new seriousness in tackling smog, but they say lasting improvements demand systemic reforms.
Yasir Hussain, a Karachi-based environmentalist, said the government’s approach this year shows more coordination than previous efforts but still lacks long-term impact.
“Artificial rain and smog guns don’t have a permanent or lasting effect,” he said. “Within an hour, pollution levels return because so much gas and particulate matter come from vehicles, industrial units, brick kilns and stubble burning.”
He believes the electric vehicle policy introduced this year could make a difference over time. “This government has taken some measures to mitigate smog, but there is a long way to go,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-17 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17190112828dc38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955655/compensation-package-for-martyred-injured-civil-armed-forces-personnel-raised-interior-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Compensation package for martyred, injured civil armed forces personnel raised: interior ministry</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday revised the compensation package for martyred and injured Civil Armed Forces (CAF) personnel, according to a notification issued by the interior ministry.
CAFs are defined as a federal paramilitary force working under the interior ministry, according to Section 18, sub-section 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973, such as the Federal Constabulary, Frontier Corps, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and Pakistan Coast Guards.
The decision to revise compensation to be on par with the Islamabad police was made by the interior ministry in August this year and approved by the cabinet on August 25.
According to today’s notification, the minimum compensation will be Rs10 million (Grade 1-9), while the maximum is now Rs20m (Grade 20 and above).
“If a member of the CAFs is shaheed (martyred), permanently disabled, injured with serious injury or minor injury, as the case may be, while on bona fide government duty, an award under these rules may be granted to him or his family, as the case may be,” the notification read.
The package also includes Rs3m in cash compensation in the event of being “incapacitated and released from services for having become invalid as a result of injury in encounters, bomb blasts, riots or watch and ward duty or terrorist activity”.
Rs1m in compensation would be provided to personnel incapacitated in the aforementioned incidents listed, but who are still serving in the department. Serious injury would award Rs200,000, while minor injury would award compensation of Rs100,000.
In 2020, compensation amounts were revised so that the deaths and injuries of civil armed forces personnel “related to security” would award maximum compensation of Rs3m (Grade 1-16) and a maximum of Rs10m (Grade 20 and above).</p><small>2025-11-17 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1720342913ed779.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955629/no-confidence-ousts-haq-in-ajk-ppps-rathore-takes-over-premiership' target='_blank'><strong>No-confidence ousts Haq in AJK; PPP’s Rathore takes over premiership</strong></a><br><p>A no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq succeeded on Monday, with 36 members in the Legislative Assembly voting in favour of it and two against it.
Of the 29 PPP members, the speaker could not cast his vote and of the 9 PML-N members, one female member abstained. Two PTI legislators — regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and leader of the opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmed — voted against the move.
Haq, who had arrived in the hall along with four loyalists, left along with them soon after delivering his speech.
Three PTI members did not attend. One member each of the Muslim Conference and the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) also abstained. Apart from them, three PTI forward bloc members — Ansar Abdali, Mazhar Saeed and deputy speaker Chaudhry Riaz — also abstained.
After the votes were counted, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was chairing the session, announced PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new premier.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
Rathore is the 16th prime minister elected in AJK since 1975, when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The newly elected prime minister said that the change would be felt not only in faces but in the system itself — and that this would be the true measure of success.
Announcing several administrative measures, he said secretaries would be entitled to only one official vehicle and that the total number of secretaries would not exceed 20. He also declared the abolition of the posts of special secretary and senior additional secretary.
He said the downsizing process would be carried down to the lowest tiers. Rathire announced the merger of the Education Department’s technical wing into the department and the drafting of a fresh transport policy. Until the new policy was finalised, no officer below grade 18 — except those in administration, the police and monitoring assistant engineers — would be permitted to use an official vehicle.
All departments, the AJK premier said, would be required to deposit extra government vehicles into the official transport pool within a week. There would be no compromise on biometric verification.
He ordered the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be reactivated and announced the cancellation of notifications for posts that had been advertised through the PSC and then withdrawn up to January 1, 2020. The PSC would hold examinations within a month and appoint qualified candidates to those posts.
The AJK premier further announced that for appointments up to grade 18 — except where recruitment was 100 per cent quota-based — at least 50pc of vacancies would be filled through direct recruitment. All departments were directed to implement this within a month.
He said the government would fully implement the Third-Party Act in accordance with the high court’s decision. The law would be enforced not only in government departments but also in semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies, including the Bank of AJK.
A uniform time-scale policy, Rathire said, would be introduced across all departments, with no time-scale increases granted above grade 19. In departments where section officer and assistant director posts existed, all admin officer positions would be abolished.
To address public grievances, the prime minister, ministers, the chief secretary, secretaries and department heads would hold open courts in every district. Complaint boxes would be installed in the offices of the prime minister and the chief secretary and opened every 15 days under their joint supervision. Judicial reforms would also be introduced, in consultation with the superior judiciary, to ensure administrative justice.
Regarding hydropower projects, the AJK PM said an agreement with the federal government would be secured in cooperation with the PML-N leadership. Improving internet speeds and strengthening the local government system were also listed as priorities.
Referring to the needs of low-paid staff, he said that as the son of Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, he felt a duty of care toward junior employees, and had therefore decided to regularise all Grade-1 employees serving in permanent posts — provided they had no pending court cases and the move did not affect anyone’s pension or legal rights. He also announced one month’s additional salary for all Grade-1 employees, to be paid from departmental development budgets.
He ordered that all driver posts be upgraded to Grade-5 and said police constables would receive facilities and allowances on par with those in Punjab. Police personnel performing duties alongside important individuals would be eligible for travel and dearness allowance.
He also announced a remission of 60 days from the sentences of prisoners in all AJK jails — except those convicted under qisas, diyat, espionage, anti-state activities or terrorism, where the remission would not apply.
At the conclusion of his speech, the prime minister reaffirmed AJK’s “unwavering support for the people of occupied Kashmir”.
Earlier, when the speaker announced the results of voting and asked Rathore to take the seat reserved for the leader of the house, the prime minister-elect — dressed in qameez shalwar and a black coat — shook hands with or embraced lawmakers in the front row, including the two lone PTI legislators.
Before Rathore’s address, PPP regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider, PTI regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and several others also spoke.
Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet.
“I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said.
While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first.
“My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.”
However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”.
Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate.
“This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned.
No-confidence motion
The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N.
Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech.

Big screens were installed outside the assembly’s building, where people viewed the proceedings live.
Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed.
In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party.
On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur.
With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years.
In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house.
After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17131147764cd81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627/bangladeshs-ousted-pm-hasina-sentenced-to-death-for-crackdown-on-students' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s ousted PM Hasina sentenced to death for crackdown on students</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.
The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February.
Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote.
The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024.

Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her.
She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
“The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “
The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court.
But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation.

After the verdict, Bangladesh urged India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. Dhaka said New Delhi was obliged to do so under an extradition treaty.
India’s foreign ministry said that it had “noted” the verdict, adding it was “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh”.
It did not comment immediately on Bangladesh’s extradition request.
Worst violence since 1971
During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024.
According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.
Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal.
Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”.
Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17180710a2dd96b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955649/another-victim-in-hyderabad-fireworks-explosion-succumbs-to-wounds-taking-death-toll-to-10' target='_blank'><strong>Another victim in Hyderabad fireworks explosion succumbs to wounds, taking death toll to 10</strong></a><br><p>Another victim from the fireworks factory explosion in Hyderabad earlier this week succumbed to his wounds at Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) on Monday, taking the toll to 10, officials said.
At least six people were killed and seven were injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a fireworks factory in Hyderabad on Saturday. Police registered a case against multiple suspects, including the owner of an allegedly illegal firecracker factory. Nine people were reported to have died till yesterday.
LUH’s Additional Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Mujeeb Kalwar told Dawn, “[The victim] was admitted with around 100 per cent burn wounds.”
In view of his critical condition, MS Kalwar added, the victim was taken to the surgical ward’s intensive care unit, where he breathed his last today.
Separately, Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio said three unidentified bodies, which were lying in LUH, also included the fireworks factory’s owner.
He told Dawn that these findings were confirmed based on DNA testing of the bodies.
According to a statement from the Rescue 1122 spokesperson on Saturday, the explosion was reported in a firecracker factory on the banks of the Laghari Goth river, Latifabad Police Station B Section limits.
Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund said the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also took strict notice of the incident and summoned a detailed report.
“The legal status of the factory should be immediately investigated. Whether the legal license and safety principles required for making fireworks were being followed or not. Playing with lives cannot be allowed, and such incidents are unacceptable in the eyes of law enforcement agencies,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on Monday.
 






The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on the complaint of B-Section Station House Officer Niaz Panhwar.
It invoked Sections 322 (punishment for intentional murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect explosive substance), 336 (punishment for mutilation or dismemberment of a limb), 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance), 337-H (punishment for hurt by a rash or negligent act) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Factory owner Asad Yousafzai and his alleged accomplices, Rashid Khan, Dilshad Khan, Arshad and Shakeel Punjabi, were nominated as suspects in the FIR.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/172015046edcc8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955660/pti-slams-political-victimisation-inhumane-treatment-of-sic-chief-hamid-raza' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams political victimisation, ‘inhumane’ treatment of SIC chief Hamid Raza</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Monday condemned the alleged political victimisation and “inhumane” jail conditions faced by incarcerated former MNA and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza.
The party claimed that essential medical care and basic rights were not being provided to the incarcerated leader, which was a grave erosion of justice, due process and constitutional protections.
The Islamabad police arrested Raza and presented him before a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court, which sent him to jail to serve his 10-year jail term in the May 9 case. The SIC chief was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party vehemently condemned Raza’s treatment during his detention.
“His arrest — carried out while he was on his way to voluntarily surrender before the court — and the subsequent denial of his basic rights in jail reflect a disturbing pattern of political persecution and a blatant disregard for human dignity,” it stated.
 






The PTI strongly demanded that Raza be immediately provided access to necessary medical care and legal facilities in jail.
“His family and legal counsel must be allowed to meet him in a proper and unhindered environment. PTI also calls for the prompt and impartial hearing of his appeals to ensure that justice is delivered without delay,” it stated.
The statement further asserted that his sentence reflected a broader political vendetta, while the conditions he was enduring in jail were “utterly intolerable”. The PTI expressed serious concern for his health and fundamental rights.
“He is being denied essential medication, while his family members and lawyers are forced to meet him through bars in inappropriate and restrictive conditions — an outright violation of constitutional guarantees,” the statement claimed.
It stated that equally troubling was the fact that a Lahore High Court (LHC) judge recused himself from hearing the petitions of Raza and others on November 14, resulting in unnecessary delays in the judicial process and undermining their right to timely justice.
Furthermore, the party noted that the failure to stay the by-election in constituency NA-104 had paved the way for an imbalanced and one-sided electoral process.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17210505829acb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955609/fm-dar-arrives-in-moscow-for-shanghai-cooperation-organisation-summit' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar arrives in Moscow for Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in Russian capital Moscow on Monday to attend the Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

The opener at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium — which will host the entirety of the tournament — will be played between the hosts and Zimbabwe, and Pakistan will look up to their all-rounders to make a difference again.
The strategy, which has emerged as a blueprint of Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson since was appointed in May this year, has come under heavy criticism due to its nature of ignoring the importance of specialist batters and bowlers.
But for Pakistan T20 captain Salman Ali Agha, it is the go-to approach given what he believes is a “luxury” to have good enough all-rounders to deliver with both bat and ball.
“As you may have seen, we try to go for all-rounders mostly, and thankfully we have some who bowl and bat equally well,” he said in the pre-series press conference at the venue on Monday.  “So we’ll try to carry on the same combination for the tri series.
“All of the all-rounders we have can bowl all four overs, and they bat really well too. So why would we not try to utilise them?
“Mohammad Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf are full bowlers and full batters. All top teams are doing that [relying on all-rounders]. We take [having that option] it as an opportunity.”
Samad likely to return
Pakistan had named the squad for the tri-series, earlier this month and will carry on with the same players, barring batter Hasan Nawaz, who was dropped and asked to play first-class cricket following a series of poor performances.
While there was no replacement announced, Abdul Samad, another batter known for his power-hitting, is being seen as Pakistan’s choice for the lower middle-order finishing position.
“In the middle-order, you can say we are not performing the way we would like to,” Salman admitted. “Yes, Hasan Nawaz isn’t there — I hope he makes a comeback soon — but we have Abdul Samad, so we may give him a go. He bats at number six and  can play the finisher’s role.”
Pakistan are unlikely to experiment further as they look to fine tune their combination with the T20 World Cup set to be held in February-March.
“We’ll try to give opportunities to all of the 15 players in the squad, but the priority is to win matches,” Salman noted. “In T20 cricket you can’t take any team lightly.
“Whichever series we play in the near future, it is for the preparation for the World Cup.”
Salman’s own form was poor during the Asia Cup, of which Pakistan lost the final against India in September. The Pakistan skipper accumulated a paltry 72 runs across seven matches.
The right-hander, however, bounced back with a century against Sri Lanka in the first match of the ODI series, which concluded with Pakistan completing a 3-0 sweep on Sunday. Salman had earlier also scored a half-century against South Africa.
“I wasn’t in the best form during the Asia Cup, neither in a good frame of mind, perhaps,” said the 31-year-old. “Failures do really affect you in international cricket. But I’ve done well in the ODIs and will try to carry that confidence into the T20s as well.”
Sri Lanka duo sent back home
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka suffered a setback ahead of the tri-series as captain Charith Asalanka and fast bowler Asitha Fernando were ruled out due to illness and sent home as a precaution.
Sri Lanka Cricket said both players needed rest and proper medical care to ensure full recovery before future assignments.
Asalanka’s absence has led to an immediate change in leadership, with experienced all-rounder Dasun Shanaka appointed captain for the tournament.
Sri Lanka have also added young batter Pavan Rathnayake to their squad as a replacement.
The tri-series format will see each team play four league fixtures before the top two sides qualify for the November 29 final.
All matches are scheduled for a 6:00pm start, with the toss taking place at 5:30pm.

The Indian army chief’s remarks come a week after an explosion near the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10, leaving 12 people dead in the first such explosion in the Indian capital since 2011.
Delivering a speech at a defence conference in New Delhi, Gen Dwivedi said, “I’d like to say that the movie hasn’t even started — only a trailer was shown, and, after the trailer, it was over within 88 hours.“
“So, we’re fully prepared for the future, and if Pakistan gives us such an opportunity, we’d like to provide them with a thorough education on how a responsible nation should behave with its neighbours.“
The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Delhi blast suspect presented in court
Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented a suspect linked to the bombing in court, one of two men accused of involvement in the suicide attack. Officials have not disclosed any details on the motives or organisational backing of the alleged attackers, both of whom they claim came from India-occupied Kashmir.
India’s National Investiagtion Agency (NIA) alleged that Amir Rashid Ali “conspired with the alleged suicide bomber, Umarun Nabi, to unleash the terror attack” last Monday.
It remains unclear whether Nabi is included in the tally.

An AFP photographer saw Ali being taken under heavy guard from a police truck to a New Delhi court to face charges. Indian media reported that the court had ordered that he be held in custody for 10 days by the NIA.
Nabi was a medical professor at a university in Haryana state, just outside the capital, while Ali had allegedly travelled to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED)”, according to the NIA.
India has provided no further information on the alleged motives or network behind the two suspects.
Another suspect apprehended: NIA
Later on Monday, the NIA said in a statement that it “arrested another key associate of the terrorist involved in the blast” in Delhi.
According to the statement, the suspect was arrested from Srinagar in India-occupied Kashmir by an NIA team, with the agency stating that he “allegedly provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast which killed 10 persons and left 32 persons injured”.
“The accused, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district of [India-occupied Kashmir], was an active co-conspirator behind the attack and had worked closely with the terrorist, Umarun Nabi, to plan the terror carnage,” the statement read.
“NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing,” it added. “Several teams of the anti-terror agency are pursuing multiple leads and are conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the terror attack.”
The Indian government has since branded the Delhi car blast a terrorist attack, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing not to spare anyone involved in the “conspiracy” the day after the blast. Yesterday, the NIA said the blast was a “suicide bombing”.</p><small>2025-11-17 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17180710f4283e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955652/pakistan-has-become-extremely-relevant-tarar-says-of-foreign-policy-on-global-stage-after-may-skirmish' target='_blank'><strong>‘Pakistan has become extremely relevant,’ Tarar says of foreign policy on global stage after May skirmish</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May.
The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries.
Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.”
He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.”
The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.”
 


He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place.
The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain.
“So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken.
“That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world.
“So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said.
He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said.
National synergy and Gen Z
Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise.
“So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire.
“So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.”
The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict.
“When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way.
“So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants.
“And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.”
Relevancy in global events
Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process.
 
 

“If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire.
“And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.”
Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.
“After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity.
“So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.”
Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union.
Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia.
Acknowledgement of economic stability
He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world.
“I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance.
“So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey.
“And I think the future is very bright.”
Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right
The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism.
“And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard.
“So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.”
Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment.
“So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership.
“So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.”
US and China
 
 

The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief.
“I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US.
“Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature.
So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“</p><small>2025-11-17 14:14</small></div><hr>
