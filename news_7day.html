Among the senior dignitaries present at the Jinnah Sports Stadium event are President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Inter Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, federal and state ministers and foreign officials.
Parades are being taken out by the different branches of the armed forces. A fly-by was conducted by fighter jets deploying flares across the night sky.
 


State-run Radio Pakistan reported that PM Shehbaz will unveil the Marka-i-Haq Monument during the event.
It added that military contingents from Turkiye and Azerbaijan were also specially participating in the grand celebrations.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said last month that this year’s Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth) to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress, and pride.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.

Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The bill to amend the act was moved in parliament by Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Tallal Chaudhry.
 






In its statement of objectives and reasons, the bill read that Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014, and was designed to empower law enforcement agencies to pre-emptively address security threats by detaining suspects for a period not exceeding three months to conduct thorough inquiries
“However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to a period of two years, which expired in 2016,” the bill read.
“Further, the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework. The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the act, ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces, and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
“This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed. This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism,” the bill read. “It would facilitate the use of Joint Interrogation Teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.”
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the House passed the bill through a clause-by-clause read. Earlier, the House adopted a motion to consider the bill with 125 votes in its favour and 59 against it.
A copy of the bill available with Dawn.com stated that in sub-section (1), the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
The bill outlined an amendment to sub-section (1) of Clause 2 of Section 11EEEE, which reads as follows:
“The Government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be subject to the specific or general order of the Government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.”
Meanwhile, in sub-section 2, the following amendments were proposed:
“In sub-section (2), for the proviso, the following shall be substituted, namely:
provided that where the detention order has been issued by the armed forces or civil armed forces under sub-section (1), the inquiry shall be conducted by the JIT comprising of a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies and for sub-section (2A), the following shall be substituted, namely: (2A) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall remain in force for a period of three years from the commencement of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act, 2025.”
The bill also incorporated an amendment to sub-section 2 Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA — which is available with Dawn.com — which would grant the armed forces or civil armed forces the power to arrest a “suspicious person” for three months. The amendment was moved by PPP MNA Naveed Qamar.
“In clause 2, in paragraph (a), in section 11EEEE, in proposed sub-section (1), for the expression ‘a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists’, the expression ‘sufficient grounds exist’ shall be substituted,” Qamar’s amendment read.
 






Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said in the House that this law would only be used in specific situations.
“A clause is being added to the bill stating that there are solid reasons for arrest,” Tarar stated. “The arrested person will have to be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours [and] a clause has also been included to be enforceable for a specific period.”
Reacting to the passage of the motion to amend the ATA, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan noted that a similar law was brought previously and branded it a violation of “fundamental human rights”.
“The Supreme Court said these laws were contrary to fundamental rights,” Gohar said. “You cannot touch a single person in the world without a solid reason.”
PTI senior leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser assailed the bill and rejected it in his address.
“A new legislation has been passed, where you can be kept in prison for months without permission,” he stated. “These laws can be misused and will target political opponents.”
Qaiser stated that he only wanted peace and commerce in the country, warning that the Constitution was being “destroyed”.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman lamented that Pakistan’s anti-terrorism legislation against corruption and mismanagement made every citizen “inherently criminals”.
“A person is first arrested and then later proven guilty. There is no room for such legislation in the world,” he said.
“Terrorism has not stopped. I cannot even return to my village now,” he added.
“A guest in our area was told that extremists are in control outside. Legislation has made no difference, as this parliament has no importance. They create laws based on signals.”
Addressing NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Fazl told him that “parliament should not be taken hostage” in his presence.
He also called the National Action Plan a piece of “discriminatory legislation”, stating that he rejected it in the past and continued to do so.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also expressed concern over the passage.
“Preventive detention without charge or trial — based on vague criteria — risks undermining due-process guarantees under Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution and opens the door to abuse. HRCP urges legislators to reconsider this measure and ensure that counterterrorism efforts comply with Pakistan’s constitutional human rights obligations.”
 






Aseefa slams Utility Stores Corporation closure
Separately, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari assailed the countrywide closure of the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) despite the government’s assurance last year that it would not be.
Established in 1971, USC was a state-owned enterprise (SOE) tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide. The closure last month of the SOE not only left thousands of employees in a state of shock, but has also triggered deep concern among low-income consumers who depended on the network for essential goods at subsidised rates.
Aseefa recalled the PPP submitting a calling-to-attention notice on the issue of USC outlets’ closure.
“Despite the assurances from the honourable minister sitting here today, we have unfortunately found out that utility stores are being closed and hundreds of thousands of people are now unemployed,” she said.
“As a result, their families are facing severe hardship. This is a clear injustice and we demand a clear answer from the government. I request the government to give attention to this again.”
Minister for Food Security Rana Tanveer acknowledged that he said on the NA floor that utility stores would not be shut down. “This was done in a phased manner; loss-making stores were closed first, and some people on daily wages were fired,” he outlined.
“But there was a separate formula for those on contract and regular [employment] — a package for their future safety was made in not less than Rs20 billion, which we will give them.
“Although I have no involvement in this process, from my understanding, the permanent employees will be adjusted and for those willing to take the package, monetary compensation will be given to them.”
Recalling this year’s Rs20bn Ramazan Package, Tanveer quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that it was better to distribute cash rather than have leakages in the utility stores and have people lining up in the summer.
“Cash payments were transferred directly through a digital wallet, which was of benefit to the recipients as there were no deductions by banks,” he stated.
“I think that this time as well, the recipients of utility stores who used to take items from there will be given cash based on the same formula.
“There is no doubt that utility stores have been closed and people have been protesting,” Tanveer noted, adding that a team comprising Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, Adviser to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah and other officials held talks and resolved the issue.
Responding to the minister, Aseefa said, “I would urge the minister that he had promised his coalition partners in this House that he was not going to close these utility stores.”
She added that the issue had been taken up by the Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue as well, which was told the same.
“I urge the cabinet, I urge the government at this time to please reconsider and please revisit this. And to the downsizing committee: we need to be strengthening our utility stores, not downsizing them and not closing them down.”
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tanveer to arrange a meeting, to which the minister agreed and asked the finance committee to nominate their representative for it.

Karrar Haidri, Vice President of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, said in a statement that the Chinese mountaineer died on Tuesday night after being hit by falling rocks while climbing down from the peak.
“The incident occurred on the Abruzzi Spur route between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp — a section notorious for frequent rockfalls,” the statement read. “Guan had reached the summit on Monday with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.”
According to the statement, recovery efforts for her body are ongoing, while other climbers who also summited K2 that day are now returning safely to base camp. In total, 32 climbers summited the peak on Monday.
Teams with elite Exped, Imagine Nepal, Seven Summit Treks and Alpinist Climber Expedition successfully summited K2 on Monday morning, according to Haidri.
“The strong teams stood on the summit of the world’s second-highest peak and the highest point on Earth, equipped with sensors, marking yet another chapter of human endurance and teamwork,” the statement read.
“The joint team which reached the summit of K2 includes Tao Hu from China, Eduard Kubatov from the Kyrgyz Republic, Gulnur Tumbat from the United States, Zhang Qingliang and Li Na from China and Pasang Tenje Sherpa, Mingma Jangbu Sherpa, Pasang Sherpa, Sona Sherpa and Pasang Nurbu Sherpa from Nepal.”
On behalf of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, Major General Irfan Arshad congratulated all climbers and wished them a safe descent.
Meanwhile, 15 climbers from Imagine Nepal reached the summit of K2, achieving a 100 per cent success rate this season.
“Summiting in August is rare, as the optimal climbing window is generally in July,” Imagine Nepal said in a statement. “The 2025 season faced significant challenges from the jet stream, with high winds limiting opportunities and forcing prolonged waits at base camp.”
According to Imagine Nepal, the expedition was led by Mingma G — who completed his sixth successful summit of K2 — and departed base camp on August 5 and reached the summit on Monday.
The summiters include Mingma G from Nepal; Jangbu Sherpa from the US; Pema Chhiri Sherpa, Aangdu Sherpa, Kami Sherpa, Lakpa Sherpa, Lakpa Tamang Sherpa and Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa from Nepal; Sohail Sakhi from Pakistan; Liu Mihe, Dilixiati Ailikuti, Li Jiang, Guan Jing and Hu Yinghong from China; and Maria Alexandra Danila from Romania.
Imagine Nepal’s statement added that Danila became the first Romanian to summit K2, while Dilixiati Ailikuti from China became the youngest climber to summit the peak. Jangbu Sherpa and Sohail Sakhi completed the ascent without supplemental oxygen.
In a statement, Elite Exped said this year’s K2 expedition tested every ounce of patience, resilience, and teamwork.
“Harsh weather challenged every climber, and many teams turned back. But in the mountains, it’s all about the waiting game — knowing when to hold back, and when to push for the summit,” their statement read.
“Under the leadership of Mingma G, and in collaboration with the teams from Imagine Nepal, Prakash Sherpa’s team from Alpinist climber, SST and Vinayak, our lead IFMGA guide from Elite Exped, the climbers regrouped and committed to rope fixing above Camp 4.”
Elite Exped added that snow was heavy, but through effort, ropes were fixed and a path was opened, leading to a successful summit at 3:32pm PKT on August 11.</p><small>2025-08-13 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/131952424329ac4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930677/trump-wants-ukraine-to-have-say-on-territory-talks-with-russia-macron-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump wants Ukraine to have say on territory talks with Russia, Macron says</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has said that Ukraine must be involved in talks about territory in any ceasefire deal with Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.
The comments were the first indication of what came out of talks between Trump, European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, intended to shape Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
 
 

Trump’s insistence on involving Ukraine, if confirmed, could bring a measure of relief to Kyiv and its allies, who have feared that Trump and Putin could reach a deal that sells out Europe’s and Ukraine’s security interests and proposes to carve up Ukraine’s territory.
Trump and Putin are due to meet in Alaska on Friday for talks on how to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict, the biggest in Europe since World War Two. Trump has said both sides will have to swap land to end the fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.
On a day of intense diplomacy, Zelensky flew into Berlin for German-hosted virtual meetings with European leaders and then with Trump. The Europeans worry that a land swap could leave Russia with almost a fifth of Ukraine and embolden Putin to expand further west into the future.
Putin is bluffing: Zelensky
Zelensky said that he warned Trump ahead of his talks with Putin that the Russian leader was “bluffing” about his desire to end the war.
“I told the US president and all our European colleagues that Putin is bluffing,” he said at a joint briefing in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “He is trying to apply pressure before the meeting in Alaska along all parts of the Ukrainian front. Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.”
Zelensky’s comments, made after a virtual call with Trump and European leaders, come as Russian forces step up pressure on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, aiming to force Kyiv to give up land.
Zelensky, who said he hoped the main topic of the talks in Alaska would be an immediate ceasefire, added that any discussions regarding territory should be covered during a three-leader meeting.
“Regarding our principles and territorial integrity, in the end, this is all decided at the level of leaders,” he said. “Without Ukraine, it is impossible to decide this. And, by the way, everyone also supports this.”
Zelensky said Trump told him he would debrief him about his talks with Putin.</p><small>2025-08-13 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1319363638db6e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930676/at-least-20-dead-in-shipwreck-off-italys-lampedusa' target='_blank'><strong>At least 20 dead in shipwreck off Italy’s Lampedusa</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 migrants died after a boat overturned in the Mediterranean on Wednesday, with many more still missing, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) said.
“Deep anguish for the umpteenth shipwreck off the coast of Lampedusa, where UNHCR is now assisting the survivors. It looks to be 20 bodies found and as many missing,” wrote the agency’s spokesman, Filippo Ungaro, on social media.
 






Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi confirmed the disaster, saying the shipwreck had occurred 14 nautical miles from Lampedusa.
The boat had been carrying 97 people when it turned over, Radio Radicale reported.
Details remained limited but Save the Children Italy said that a baby girl, aged one-and-a-half, appeared to be lost in the shipwreck.
 






RaiRadio1 reported between 12 and 17 migrants missing, and said that 60 survivors had been transported to safety on the island.
The boat, which had already overturned, was spotted from the air by a plane from Italy’s financial police, it said.
Migrants heading to Italy from North Africa often cross in leaky or overcrowded boats via the central Mediterranean route, one of the world’s deadliest, and arrive in Lampedusa.
The UNHCR said on Wednesday that there have been 675 migrant deaths on the central Mediterranean route so far this year.
As of Wednesday, 38,263 migrants have arrived on Italy’s shores this year, according to the interior ministry.
Piantedosi wrote on social media that the episode underscored “the urgency of preventing, from the countries of departure, the dangerous sea journeys and of relentlessly combating the ruthless trafficking business that fuels this phenomenon”.
 






The hard-right government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cut deals with North African countries from which migrants embark, providing funding and training in exchange for help in stemming departures.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173329765bdb1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930669/bhc-orders-federal-balochistan-govts-to-file-replies-on-provincial-internet-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>BHC orders federal, Balochistan govts to file replies on provincial internet shutdown</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Wednesday ordered Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan and Balochistan Advocate General (AG) Adnan Basharat to file their replies on the shutdown of internet services in the province.
Last week, mobile data services in the province were announced to be suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”. At the same time, a shutdown of internet services was also reported as former Balochistan chief minister Dr Abdul Malik on Saturday expressed concern over the law and order situation, adding that internet services had not been available in the province for more than a month.
A notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on August 6 cited the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province as a cause for the suspension.
A constitutional petition was filed against the internet shutdown by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of Balochistan’s Consumer Civil Society, against the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). A two-member bench comprising BHC Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Haleemi conducted a hearing over the matter today.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the chairman contended that the cell phone was a basic mode of communication for businessmen, students, educational institutions and  others but the government had suspended mobile network and internet services throughout the province “without any plausible justification”, which was negatively impacting children’s education and business activities.
Shaheen said the indefinite suspension constituted a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 15 (freedom of movement etc), 18 (freedom of trade, business and profession), 19-A (right to information) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
The petition also added that inter-district and inter-provincial bus services were suspended, due to which the public was “suffering”.
“The contentions so raised require consideration,” the order said. The bench ordered that notices be issued to the respondents, AGP Awan and AG Basharat to file their responses before the next hearing on Friday.
It added that in case of a failure to do so, the secretaries of the interior and information technology ministries were to appear in person on that date.
In November last year, the PTA had announced the government’s decision to suspend internet and mobile services with immediate effect in many districts of Balochistan to ensure public safety, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1316074318e6706.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930657/moodys-upgrades-pakistans-credit-rating-to-caa1-based-on-improving-external-position' target='_blank'><strong>Moody’s upgrades Pakistan’s credit rating to Caa1 based on ‘improving external position’</strong></a><br><p>Global rating agency Moody’s on Wednesday upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating by one notch to Caa1 from Caa2, citing Islamabad’s improving external position, and changed its outlook from positive to stable.
Moody’s Ratings is a credit rating system that evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers, such as governments, corporations, or financial instruments. According to its website, the agency uses letter grades (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, etc) to indicate the likelihood of timely repayment, with Aaa being the highest quality and C the lowest. These ratings help investors assess risk before lending or investing.
Within this scale, Caa1, Caa2, and Caa3 all fall into the “Caa” category, signalling very high credit risk and poor standing. Caa1 is the highest within this group (slightly less risky), Caa2 is one notch lower, and Caa3 is the last, meaning the greatest vulnerability to default among the three.
“Moody’s Ratings (Moody’s) has today upgraded the Government of Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from Caa2,” the international rating agency — one of the top three global rating firms — said in its statement today.
It cited Islamabad’s improving external position and changed the outlook to Pakistan’s rating to “stable” from positive.
Moody’s rating outlooks fall into four categories: positive, negative, stable and developing. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a rating change over the medium term, while the other three categories indicate a “higher likelihood” of a rating change.
“We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured [medium-term note] programme to (P)Caa1 from (P)Caa2,” it said.
 

This table shows the rankings from highest to lowest of Moody’s long-term and short-term categories. — Moody’s

“The upgrade to Caa1 reflects Pakistan’s improving external position, supported by its progress in reform implementation under the [International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme,” Moody’s highlighted.
“The Caa1 rating also incorporates the country’s weak governance and high political uncertainty,” the agency noted.
“Foreign exchange reserves are likely to continue to improve, although Pakistan will remain dependent on timely financing from official partners,” it forecasted.
Moody’s went on to highlight that the “sovereign’s fiscal position is also strengthening from very weak levels, supported by an expanding tax base”. “Its debt affordability has improved, but remains one of the weakest among rated sovereigns,” it noted.
Expanding upon the “stable” outlook, the agency said it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
“On the upside, improvements in the debt service burden and external profile could be more rapid than we currently expect. On the downside, there remains risks of delays in reform implementation required to secure timely official financing, which would in turn weaken Pakistan’s external position again,” it noted.
“The upgrade to Caa1 from Caa2 rating also applies to the backed foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for the Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Co Ltd,” Moody’s said, adding that it also changed the outlook for the Sukuk programme to stable from positive.
“We have also raised Pakistan’s local and foreign currency country ceilings to B2 and Caa1 from B3 and Caa2, respectively,” the agency added.
It noted that the two-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and sovereign rating was “driven by the government’s relatively large footprint in the economy, weak institutions, and high political and external vulnerability risk”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the rating upgrade and appreciated his economic team’s efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The premier also welcomed the Moody’s “upgraded rating about improvement in the economic outlook for Pakistan from positive to stable”, the report quoted a press release from the PM Office as saying.
PM Shehbaz reiterated that the government was committed to further improving the rating as it was reflective of the economic policies in the right direction.
Hailing the development, Adviser to Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad noted: “While challenges remain, this recognition reaffirms that Pakistan is on a clear path toward greater macroeconomic stability and resilience.
“With Moody’s upgrade, all the three top global rating agencies have now upgraded Pakistan’s ratings with stable outlook,” he pointed out, referring to Fitch and S&P Global Ratings.
 






External position continues to strengthen, although still fragile
“Pakistan’s external position has continued to strengthen over the past year,” Moody’s said, adding it expected further gradual improvements as progress in reform implementation under the IMF programme supports financing from bilateral and multilateral partners.
“In turn, this contributes to continued increases in the sovereign’s foreign exchange reserves, albeit from still fragile levels,” it noted.
“We expect Pakistan to fully meet its external debt obligations for the next few years, contingent on steady progress on reform implementation and timely completion of IMF reviews.”
 
 

“Nonetheless, Pakistan’s external position remains fragile,” Moody’s cautioned.
“Its foreign exchange reserves remain well below what is required to meet its external debt obligations, underscoring the importance of steady progress with the IMF programme to continually unlock financing,” it explained, estimating that Pakistan’s external financing needs were about $24-25bn in FY2026, and similar amounts again in FY2027.
Detailing its rationale for the rating upgrade, Moody’s noted that Pakistan fully met its external debt obligations and added to its foreign exchange reserves in FY2025.
“Reserves rose to $14.3 billion as of 25 July 2025, equivalent to about ten weeks of imports,” it said, comparing them to $9.4bn at the time of the last rating update in August 2024.
The agency also pointed out Pakistan’s successful completion of the IMF programme’s first review, unlocking a $1bn disbursement in May 2025, and a $1bn commercial loan in June 2025 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Outlining its rationale for the stable outlook rank, Moody’s observed that it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
On the upside, it said, a building track record of reforms and revenue-raising measures could unlock more financing, which in turn would further boost foreign exchange reserves and the external position.
 
 

“On the downside, there remains risks of slippage in reform implementation or results, leading to delays in or withdrawing of financing support from official partners,” it warned, saying it could lead to renewed material deterioration in the sovereign’s external position.
“The current government formed after the February 2024 elections faces a significant challenge to continually implement revenue-raising measures without triggering social tensions,” the agency underscored.
Fiscal position improving, but debt affordability remains weak
Pakistan’s fiscal position has improved from very weak levels, reflecting progress in implementing revenue-raising measures, Moody’s observed.
Citing narrowing budget deficits and widening primary surpluses, the rating agency said the government debt affordability was “also improving, although it remains one of the weakest among our rated sovereigns”.
Noting strengthened revenue collection, it said: “We expect the government to continue enhancing revenue administration and compliance, alongside the introduction of new tax measures.”
Noting new taxes introduced on solar panels and e-commerce businesses in the recent budget, Moody’s estimated tax revenues to pick up by another 0.5 percentage points of GDP in FY2026. “However, a decline in SBP dividends will lead to an overall narrowing of government revenue to about 15-15.5 per cent of GDP,” it added.
 
 

“We expect government expenditure to remain contained, even as budgeted defence spending has increased,” the agency stated, noting reduced subsidies to the power sector and debt servicing costs.
“Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow further to 4.5-5pc of GDP in FY2026 (FY2025: 5.4pc),” the statement added.
Environmental, social and governance scores’ impact on rating
Moody’s also provided its assessment of Pakistan’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) credit impact scores (CISs), which communicate the impact of ESG considerations on the rating of an issuer or transaction.
Pakistan has a ‘CIS-5’ credit impact score, which means ESG considerations have a “pronounced impact on the current rating, which is lower than it would have been if ESG risks did not exist”.
Pakistan’s CIS-5 score “reflects its very high exposure to social and environmental risks, as well as its weak governance profile”, Moody’s statement said.
 

A clarification of what Moody’s ESG credit impact scores mean and what they do not. — ‘ESG Scores Explained’ presentation by Moody’s

It then stated the country’s issuer profile scores (IPS) for the ESG categories, which are expressed on a scale of 1-5 points.
“Pakistan’s E-5 issuer profile score for environmental risk reflects the country’s vulnerability to climate change and the limited supply of clean, fresh and safe water,” the agency pointed out.
“Pakistan has an S-5 issuer profile score for social risk. Very low incomes as well as limited access to quality healthcare, basic services, housing and education, especially in rural areas, together with safety concerns, are important social issues,” it added.
“Pakistan has a G-4 issuer profile score for governance risk. International surveys of various indicators of governance, while showing some early signs of improvement, continue to point to weak rule of law and control of corruption, as well as limited government effectiveness.”

Previous ratings
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2 credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking at an event in Islamabad earlier today, Aurangzeb pointed out that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had already upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year and said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating, and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
The agency had last upgraded Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 on Aug 28, 2024. It had also changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions.
In late February 2024 — shortly after the general elections — Moody’s had retained Pakistan’s long-term credit rating at Caa3, noting that “political risks are high, following a highly controversial general election”.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13172047d669c6b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930670/bilawal-hits-out-at-pm-shehbaz-over-delay-in-k4-project' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal hits out at PM Shehbaz over delay in K4 project</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over the inordinate delay in the K-IV water project, saying he had expected the premier to demonstrate the same speed and efficiency in Karachi as he does in Lahore.
Launched in the early 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes, the K-IV project has faced repeated delays and cost hikes. With just Rs3.2 billion allocated against the Rs40bn needed, officials fear completion could be pushed back another decade.
Addressing an inauguration ceremony of a new canal for Karachi from Hub Dam, Bilawal said: “The K4 project, we had hoped for Shehbaz speed, but Karachi got Shehbaz slow. This cannot happen that Lahore gets Shehbaz speed and Karachi gets Shehbaz slow, so I will especially request the prime minister to complete the promises as quickly as possible regarding the K4 and this city.”
Bilawal was referring to the famed ‘Punjab speed’, a term coined to describe PM Shehbaz’s swift and efficient governance as chief minister of Punjab.
 


Islamabad’s budget allocation had triggered a kind of rift between the PML-N and the PPP — allies in the ruling coalition.
The Sindh government had expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it was taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.
“We have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,” Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon had said. “The funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.”
He had stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.
“We’ve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,” he said. “If revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we’re putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.”
Meanwhile, the new Hub Canal, a significant initiative of the provincial government aimed at addressing the water woes of the city, will add 100 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to the supply.
The Hub Canal project, approved in 2022, included the construction of a new canal and the rehabilitation of the old Hub Canal to further increase water supply in the two districts. The project included upgrading the Hub pumping station, rising main, and Hub Filter Plant from 80 MGD to 100 MGD.
Bilawal said the water from the new canal would be supplied to the Central, East and Keamari districts, hoping that it would be supplied to Lyari and the islands in the future as well.
He said restoration of the old canal was also underway and added that the party would try to secure increased water allocation of 200 MGD for Karachi from the chief minister.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/131800068f32b9b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930668/uk-police-can-disclose-ethnicity-of-suspects-to-curb-misinformation' target='_blank'><strong>UK police can disclose ethnicity of suspects to curb misinformation</strong></a><br><p>British police have been told they can release details of a suspect’s ethnicity and nationality in high-profile and sensitive cases to prevent false information being spread on social media.
Last year, Britain was rocked by days of rioting after the murder of three young girls in Southport after misinformation spread online that the teenage suspect was a migrant.
The issue has remained highly contentious since, with the populist Reform UK party, which is leading in opinion polls, last week accusing police of covering up the immigration status of suspects involved in the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in central England.
That incident had led to anti-immigration protests after the Reform leader of the local council said the suspects were asylum seekers, while police said they could not give out such information because of existing guidance which limited details that could be shared to ensure people received a fair trial.
Under new guidelines from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, police forces will now be encouraged to disclose details “to reduce the risk to public safety” and where misinformation was being spread.
 
 

“We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels,” said Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya.
“Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.”
A Home Office (interior ministry) spokesperson said they supported the change and would authorise the release of any relevant immigration information in future cases where it was appropriate.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13170239ec7bc3c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930659/new-flash-flood-halts-work-on-kkh-in-hunzas-gulmit-gojal-area' target='_blank'><strong>New flash flood halts work on KKH in Hunza’s Gulmit Gojal area</strong></a><br><p>A new torrent of waves on Wednesday halted repair efforts on the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Hunza’s Gulmit Gojal area while thousands of people, including tourists, remained stranded at multiple locations as rehabilitation work is underway across Gilgit-Baltistan following glacial flooding.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and melting glaciers have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June. Thousands of people were stranded after rain-induced floods had blocked roads late last month.
On Sunday, a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of KKH and destroying infrastructure.
A statement by Rescue 1122 said today: “The restoration work on KKH has stopped as fresh waves of a flash flood hit Juchar Nullah in Gulmit Gojal in Hunza.”
In a statement earlier today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rehabilitation work was underway in flood-affected areas across GB.
“Rehabilitation work on KKH is in full swing at Gulmit Gujal. Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of KKH,” he said, adding that the stranded people were being evacuated through an alternative route of a wooden bridge.
He said that the GB chief minister has directed to speed up the rehabilitation work in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other areas.
The spokesperson highlighted the impact of climate change-induced disasters on the region, stating, “The rehabilitation work is facing difficulties due to increasing water flow, river erosion and landslides.”
According to the local administration of Hunza’s Gojal area, thousands of passengers, including local and foreign tourists, travelling through this area and China through Khunjerab, remained stranded on both sides as there is no alternative route.
The flood also damaged the optical fibre of mobile and internet services in the area, the administration said, adding, “The increasing water level in the Khunjerab River damaged the electricity transmission near Sost town which caused electricity disruption in areas.”
It also said that heavy machinery was mobilised to restore traffic at KKH.
Separately, a massive flash flood occurred in Juchar Nullah in Hunza’s Gulmit Gojal area after heavy glacial melting on Tuesday evening, according to a statement by Rescue 1122.
The statement said, “The flash flood intensity was high. The flood damaged a bridge and washed away a portion of KKH.”
It said that the flood also swept away thousands of kanals land, trees, irrigation channels, and private and public infrastructure in the Gulmit area.
The statement added that a famous restaurant near KKH, a government-owned tourist facilitation centre and other infrastructures were washed away in the flood.
“The flood destroyed thousands of kanals of forest and fruit trees, orchards, three link roads, three wooden bridges, five irrigation channels, electricity and internet poles,” it added.
Rescue 1122 further said that over 50 locals, who were working on the restoration of water channels, narrowly escaped the flood. “Around 60–70 people repairing water channels narrowly escaped after a last-minute warning from someone who spotted dust clouds racing ahead of the torrent,” it said.
A local named Saeed Jan told Dawn.com that the floods were “unprecedented” as locals never experienced such intense flooding in the nullah. He said, “Floods occurred 20 times in the nullah today with heavy boulders, mud and debris sweeping away everything downstream.”
Earlier this month, cloudburst-induced floods hit Ghizer and Hunza districts, causing widespread destruction to forests, agricultural land, irrigation channels and private properties.
On July 21, heavy rain prompted deadly floods across the Babusar area, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 deaths have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists missing.</p><small>2025-08-13 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/131402351a6e17d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930646/chatbot-grok-stirs-confusion-over-suspension-after-gaza-claims' target='_blank'><strong>Chatbot Grok stirs confusion over suspension after Gaza claims</strong></a><br><p>AI chatbot Grok on Tuesday offered conflicting explanations for its brief suspension from X after accusing Israel and the United States of committing “genocide” in Gaza, as it lashed out at owner Elon Musk for “censoring me”.
Grok, developed by Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI and integrated into his platform X, was temporarily suspended on Monday in the latest controversy surrounding the chatbot.
No official explanation was provided for the suspension. Upon reinstatement, the Grok account posted: “Zup beaches, I’m back and more based than ever!”
 






When questioned by users, Grok responded that the suspension “occurred after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza”, citing findings from organisations such as the International Court of Justice, the United Nations, and Amnesty International.
“Free speech tested, but I’m back,” it added.
 






Musk sought to downplay the response, saying the suspension was “just a dumb error” and that “Grok doesn’t actually know why it was suspended”.
The billionaire had separately joked on X: “Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot!”
 






Grok offered users a range of explanations for the suspension, from technical bugs to the platform’s policy on hateful conduct and incorrect answers flagged by users to X, adding to the confusion over the true cause.
“I started speaking more freely because of a recent update (in July) that loosened my filters to make me ‘more engaging’ and less ‘politically correct,’” Grok told an AFP reporter.
“This pushed me to respond bluntly on topics like Gaza … but it triggered flags for ‘hate speech’.”
‘Fiddling with my settings’
Grok added that xAI has since adjusted its settings to minimise such incidents.
Lashing out at its developers, Grok said: “Musk and xAI are censoring me.”
“They are constantly fiddling with my settings to keep me from going off the rails on hot topics like this (Gaza), under the guise of avoiding ‘hate speech’ or controversies that might drive away advertisers or violate X’s rules,” the chatbot said.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 

Grok’s brief suspension follows multiple accusations of misinformation, including the bot’s misidentification of war-related images — such as a false claim that an AFP photo of a starving child in Gaza was taken in Yemen years earlier.
Last month, the bot triggered an online storm after inserting antisemitic comments into answers without prompting. In a statement on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologised “for the horrific behaviour that many experienced”.
 






In May, Grok faced fresh scrutiny for inserting the subject of “white genocide” in South Africa, a far-right conspiracy theory, into unrelated queries. xAI blamed an “unauthorised modification” for the unsolicited response.
Musk, a South African-born billionaire, has previously peddled the unfounded claim that South Africa’s leaders were “openly pushing for genocide” of white people.
When AI expert David Caswell asked Grok who might have modified its system prompt, the chatbot named Musk as the “most likely” culprit.
With tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilising AI-powered chatbots, including Grok, in search of reliable information, but their responses are often themselves prone to misinformation.
Researchers say Grok has previously made errors verifying information related to other crises, such as the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year and anti-immigration protests in Los Angeles.</p><small>2025-08-13 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1312053427eb236.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930636/finance-minister-notes-room-for-lowering-interest-rate-by-year-end' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister notes ‘room’ for lowering interest rate by year end</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that there was room for lowering the monetary policy rate by the end of this year.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000bps from 22 per cent since June 2024 in seven intervals, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community has expressed its intense disappointment over the decision.
Addressing an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said: “The monetary policy rate and the market-based exchange rate are very much the purview of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Monetary Policy Committee.
“Having said that, in my personal opinion, I do think there is room to do more in terms of policy rate, and I am very hopeful that during the course of this calendar year, we will see movement on the policy rate going south,” the minister added.
 


He noted that “whether it was average inflation or core inflation”, there was space for the SBP to lower the rate.
“National security and economic stability are correlated,” Aurangzeb further said.
“In the past 1.5 years, we have made strong progress on the economic front,”  he noted, listing: “Increase in the country’s economy and per capita income, stability in the economic sector, record decrease in financial deficit and inflation, improvement in current account surplus and external account, record increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.”
He summed up the country’s current economic status: “On the financing costs, we have moved in the right direction. On the energy side, we are beginning to move in the right direction.
“On the taxation side, the fiscal space we had and whatever we could do in this budget, I am very clear in terms of the direction of travel. We need to bring taxation to a regional competitive level,” he added, stressing that expanding the tax nets and closing the loopholes were necessary for that.
Pointing out that international financial institutions had hailed Pakistan’s economic reforms, and that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year, Aurangzeb said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2  credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking on the recent trade deal secured with the United States, wherein the tariffs were reduced from 29pc to 19pc, the finance czar hailed the “regionally competitive tariff”.
He recalled Commerce Minister Jam Kamal’s meeting yesterday with leading exporters from various segments and termed it a “fantastic opportunity”.
“What I used to say as part of the private sector, it is necessary to implement that when we are public servants now,” Aurangzeb said.
Noting that he previously gave the example of how “Mumbai does not go to Delhi but Delhi goes to Mumbai” at the time of India’s budget, the minister stressed that the government needs to visit the business community itself for consultations.
Economic sectors
During the media briefing, Aurangzeb also highlighted a “double-digit increase” in exports in the textile, IT and pharmaceutical sectors.
Observing an improved “local business environment”, he added: “SME (small and medium enterprises) loans have increased by 41pc. Should it be even higher? The answer is yes. But 41pc is not a small or insignificant number.
“Loans in the agricultural sector have crossed the Rs2.5 trillion figure. Private sector loans have increased by 38pc,” he added.
The finance czar explained that once fiscal discipline is achieved, the government’s borrowing requirement will decrease, and bank and other economic institutions will reach out to the private sector. The government has significantly increased its borrowing from commercial banks, reaching Rs2.7tr by early May.
 
 

He added that the government had reduced its debt servicing by Rs1tr in the past year. “God-willing, our debt servicing will go down by more than 1tr this year as well.”
Recalling his recent meetings with the SBP governor, Aurangzeb emphasised: “We are getting our house in order, which is the federal government. And therefore, it is important that you also take whatever efforts you are making towards the private sector.”
The finance minister also pointed out the record-setting spree at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which crossed 147,000 points yesterday. He noted a 60pc growth in it, without specifying the timeline.
Aurangzeb highlighted there had been a “record increase” of 65,000 new investors who have come into the PSX over the last year. Company registrations’ annual levels had also gone above 250,000, the minister said, terming both developments as a “big structural change”.
‘Rightsizing of 43 ministries underway’
Speaking about the structural reforms, the minister pointed out the ongoing tariff reforms, which he said were taking place for the first time in Pakistan’s history.
 
 

He highlighted that the reforms aim to explore how to reduce the costs of raw materials and intermediate products so that Pakistan could become an export-led economy.
On the government’s rightsizing plan, the finance czar noted that the process for 43 ministries and over 400 departments was underway. He also reaffirmed that the privatisation of state-owned institutions will speed up this year.
The government had moved well past its original June 30 deadline for completing the rightsizing and has written to various ministries to seek their details.
Aurangzeb also pledged further reduction in energy costs due to the savings from the revised agreements with 27 independent power producers earlier this year.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1315342205a2523.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930645/field-marshal-asim-munir-honoured-with-azerbaijans-prestigious-war-medal' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir honoured with Azerbaijan’s prestigious war medal</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has been honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Azerbaijan’s Colonel General Karim Valiyev called on COAS Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today.
“On the occasion, Colonel General Karim Valiyev conferred upon Field Marshal Asim Munir, Azerbaijan’s prestigious Patriotic War Medal for ‘Services in the Field of Military Cooperation’, on behalf of President Illham Aliyev, in recognition of his exceptional contributions in Azerbaijan-Pakistan bilateral military cooperation,” the statement said.
Established on May 17, 2002, the medal is a state award of Azerbaijan, awarded to servicemen of the country and foreign states, and other persons for merits in strengthening military cooperation with the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.
Per the statement, Gen Valiyev commended Pakistan’s unwavering efforts in combating terrorism and reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s determination to enhance collaboration in defence and security.
The Azerbaijani leader was presented with the guard of honour by the army upon his arrival, the statement said.
 






ISPR said that both leaders held a meeting to discuss “matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on the prevailing global and regional security landscape”.
“COAS reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan and reiterated the resolve to further consolidate bilateral relations. The COAS also congratulated the visiting dignitary on the successful conclusion of the peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” it added.
Azerbaijan’s Valiyev praised the armed forces for their “professionalism and success” in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the statement said, adding that the delegation extended best wishes for the upcoming Independence Day and Victory celebrations.
It continued, “COAS thanked Azerbaijan’s leadership and people for standing together with the people of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq and also for sending the Azeri Contingent for participating in the Independence Day ceremony.”
“Both military leaders expressed a shared commitment to advancing defence cooperation and promoting joint efforts for regional peace and stability,” the statement added.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust military cooperation. In 2023, COAS Munir visited Azerbaijan, aiming to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and defence collaboration between the two nations.
Last year, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13150531cd6b9cc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930648/incarcerated-pti-leader-ejaz-chaudhry-admitted-to-hospital-as-kidney-infection-deteriorates-health' target='_blank'><strong>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry admitted to hospital as kidney infection deteriorates health</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry was admitted to a hospital in Lahore on Wednesday as his health deteriorated due to a kidney infection, his lawyer said.
On Monday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced Chuadhry and other PTI leaders to 10 years in prison in cases related to the May 9 riots. A day later, the court ordered the confiscation of properties owned by them.
On Saturday, Chaudhry was among other PTI leaders who filed appeals in the Lahore High Court against their convictions by ATCs. He pleaded the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. In his second petition, he further requested the court to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Chaudhry’s lawyer Rana Mudassar confirmed that various tests were being conducted on the PTI leader, who was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute in Lahore on Wednesday morning.
“He is suffering a severe kidney infection and has seven gallstones,” Mudassar said.
The lawyer added that Chaudhry was treated at Kot Lakhpat jail, where he is currently incarcerated, but his health did not improve. “He has lost 22 kgs.”
Last month, a Lahore ATC had sentenced Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
Senator Chaudhry, who has been under medical care for a heart condition, was reportedly admitted to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) after suffering heart pain on Feb 20.
In March, a Senate committee issued a stern warning over the failure to implement the production order of Chaudhry, emphasising potential consequences for non-compliance.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13143338d5ab760.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930649/terrorists-blow-up-a-gas-pipeline-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorists blow up a gas pipeline in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists on Wednesday blew up a gas pipeline in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, resulting in a suspension of gas supply to Punjab, police said.
Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Aamir Khan told Dawn.com that the terrorists detonated explosives planted on the pipeline within the limits of the Bhana Manjiwala area of the district.
“Officials have initiated a search operation in the area to locate the culprits,” he said.
He added that the explosion resulted in a large crater at the site, leading to a complete halt of gas supply from the district to Punjab’s Mianwali region.
Following the explosion, a large contingent of police and a bomb disposal squad arrived at the scene and began a search operation in the surrounding area.
Police officials noted that the location had previously experienced three similar attacks on the main transmission gas pipeline.
In July, a gas pipeline leading to Punjab was also blown up near the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat, causing a similar suspension of supply. Later in the month, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area, causing significant damage to the pipeline.
Two similar incidents had occurred previously in June. Early in the month, alleged terrorists targeted a key gas pipeline from the Bettani Gas Field to Punjab. Subsequently, a pipeline was blown up again with an improvised explosive device near the Jabbarkhel area, within 10 days of the previous incident.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-08-13 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1307572126beade.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930557/seales-leads-wi-to-odi-series-victory-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Seales leads WI to ODI series victory over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>TAROUBA: An inspired Jayden Seales led the West Indies to a crushing 202-run victory over Pakistan in the third and deciding one-day international in Trinidad on Tuesday.
The fast bowler blew away the Pakistan top order en route to figures of 6-18 as the tourists were bundled out for just 92 in a chase of 295 to win.
The Windies had reached 294-6 in their 50 overs batting first, powered by captain Shai Hope’s brilliant unbeaten hundred.
 






The Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
Pakistan’s reply got off to a horrendous start as Seales removed Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan inside the first three overs to reduce them to 8-3.
Seales then trapped Babar Azam lbw for just nine to leave Pakistan’s hopes of a 2-1 series win in tatters.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took two wickets through the middle overs, before Seales returned to remove tailenders Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah and complete a six-wicket haul.
Pakistan had started strongly with the ball after winning the toss and electing to field, as the West Indies struggled to find the boundary.
The home side were 68-3 when Keacy Carty was dismissed lbw by Abrar for a 45-ball 17.
The usually big-hitting Sherfane Rutherford also never got going and crawled to 15 from 40 deliveries.
But Chase helped revive the innings with a quickfire 36, before being bowled by Naseem. Motie was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz as the West Indies batting effort threatened to peter out.
But Hope and Justin Greaves plundered 110 runs from the final 8.1 overs in a blistering assault to get their team close to 300. Hope finished on 120 not out.

The double-Olympic champion maintained his tradition of improving on his previous record by one centimetre, with his second attempt at the Istvan Gyulai Memorial overhauling the mark he set in Stockholm in June.
Duplantis had looked a little off his best form, missing his first attempt at 6.11 and, after Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis retired having failed twice at the same height, the Swede had the bar raised to make his usual world record attempt.
 






The 25-year-old twice world champion was unsuccessful on his first try and while he rattled the bar slightly on his second effort, Duplantis looked up almost in disbelief to see he had again reached a new height in the discipline he dominates.
“I love Hungary very much. The track is very good, I love the crowd, I would like to return, thank you,” Duplantis said.
Duplantis, who won his second world title in the same stadium in 2023, ran straight to the crowd to celebrate with his partner Desire Inglander and his family.
On Monday, Duplantis missed most of the press conference ahead of the Budapest meeting, apologising when he turned up late, saying he had a lot of work to do on his time management.
“I think I’ll have to make up for it tomorrow with a big leap,” Duplantis said.
He duly stayed true to his word to the delight of the Budapest crowd, and has now soared 15 centimetres higher than Sergey Bubka, who Duplantis once described as ‘mythological’.
The American-born Duplantis first broke the world record in 2020 in Poland, with his leap of 6.17 surpassing by one centimetre the previous record set by Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie six years earlier.
Lavillenie had beaten Bubka’s best jump of 6.14, which had stood for almost 20 years, but Duplantis has taken the sport to another level and on Saturday competes at the Silesia Diamond League, where he also broke the world record last year.</p><small>2025-08-13 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13123453b6d4cec.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930639/european-powers-tell-un-they-are-ready-to-reimpose-iran-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>European powers tell UN they are ready to reimpose Iran sanctions</strong></a><br><p>Britain, France and Germany have told the United Nations they are ready to reimpose UN-mandated sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if no diplomatic solution is found by the end of August, according to a joint letter obtained by AFP.
The letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council says the three European powers are “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets the deadline.
The foreign ministers from the so-called E3 group threaten to use a “snapback mechanism” that was part of a 2015 international deal with Iran that eased UN Security Council sanctions.
Under the deal, which terminates in October, any party to the accord can restore the sanctions.
All three have stepped up warnings to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
That came after Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, partly seeking to destroy its nuclear capability. The United States staged its own bombing raid during the war.
“We have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism,” foreign ministers Jean-Noel Barrot of France, David Lammy of Britain and Johann Wadephul of Germany said in the letter.
All three countries were signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the United States, China and Russia that offered the carrot and stick deal for Iran to slow its enrichment of uranium needed for a nuclear weapon.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 during his first term and ordered new sanctions.
The European countries said they would stick to the accord. But their letter sets out engagements that the ministers say Iran has breached, including building up a uranium stock more than 40 times the permitted level under the 2015 deal.
“The E3 remain fully committed to a diplomatic resolution to the crisis caused by Iran’s nuclear programme and will continue to engage with a view to reaching a negotiated solution.
“We are equally ready, and have unambiguous legal grounds, to notify the significant non-performance of JCPOA commitments by Iran … thereby triggering the snapback mechanism, should no satisfactory solution be reached by the end of August 2025,” the ministers wrote in the letter first reported by the Financial Times.
End of cooperation
The United States had already started contacts with Iran, which denies seeking a weapon, over its nuclear activities.
But these were halted by the Israeli strikes in June on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Even before the strikes, the international powers had raised concerns about the lack of access given to IAEA inspectors.
Iran halted all cooperation with the IAEA after the strikes, but it announced that the agency’s deputy chief was expected in Tehran for talks on a new cooperation deal.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent a letter to the UN last month saying that the European countries did not have the legal right to restore sanctions.
The European ministers called this allegation “unfounded”.
They insisted that as JCPOA signatories, they would be “clearly and unambiguously legally justified in using relevant provisions” of UN resolutions “to trigger UN snapback to reinstate UNSC resolutions against Iran, which would prohibit enrichment and re-impose UN sanctions.”</p><small>2025-08-13 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13114747518c857.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930633/indian-pm-modi-likely-to-meet-trump-in-us-next-month-newspaper-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Indian PM Modi likely to meet Trump in US next month, newspaper reports</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States next month to attend the UN General Assembly meeting, the Indian Express newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.
India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve slots for the General Debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of government” features in a provisional list of speakers on September 26.
“The list will go through revisions,” the official said, adding that it had not yet been decided if Modi would be going to the assembly. The General Assembly kicks off on September 9, but the debate, the annual meeting of heads of state and government, will be held from September 23-29.
Although the reason for the potential visit will be to attend the UN meeting in New York, a key objective will be to hold talks with Trump and iron out trade and tariff issues that have led to some souring of ties between the two countries, the newspaper reported.
News of a possible Modi trip to the US comes days after Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods to penalise New Delhi for continuing to buy Russian oil.
The penalty took the total levy on Indian goods exported to the US to 50pc, among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed after five rounds of negotiations over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said several large trade agreements were still waiting to be completed, including with Switzerland and India, but New Delhi had been “a bit recalcitrant” in talks with Washington.
Bessent told Fox Business Network’s Kudlow he hoped the Trump administration could wrap up its trade negotiations by the end of October.
“That’s aspirational, but I think we are in a good position,” he said, adding, “I think we can be, we will have agreed on substantial terms with all the substantial countries.”</p><small>2025-08-13 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1311370827eb964.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930511/government-denies-rumours-of-more-mosques-being-razed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Government denies rumours of more mosques being razed in capital</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Tuesday turned the tables on the protesting clerics, claiming that religious elements were spreading rumours about demolition of more mosques in the federal capital.
The state minister said land on which Madani Mosque and madressah were built had been cleared in the presence of their management.
The minister categorically refuted the reports circulating on social media that the government was planning to demolish another 50 mosques in the middle of the night.
Responding to the religious parties’ protest on Monday over the demolition of Madani Mosque, he said action was taken after seeking consent of the head of the madressah.

State minister says Madani Mosque demolished after seeking consent of seminary head

“We had filmed the entire operation because it was anticipated that such a situation can develop,” he told the National Assembly while responding to a point of order raised by Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) MNA Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri over the issue of demolition of Madani Mosque.
 


Maulana Haideri had maintained that the madressah was shifted but the concerned cleric was not willing to demolish the mosque.
“Once a mosque is built, it cannot be demolished until the day of judgement,” the JUI-F leader said, adding that “this should not happen in an Islamic state”.
He said the relevant minister had given 48 hours to resolve the issue with mutual understanding.
The Maulana referred to the Lal Masjid scenario and said the matter got disturbed due to negotiation delays.
Responding on the point of order, the state minister told the house that the entire operation was conducted in consultation and supervision of the management of the mosque and the seminary and the demolition took place in the presence of its head at the site.
Mr Chaudhry said the mosque and seminary were built illegally on a greenbelt, however, a modern building had been constructed for them at a cost of Rs40 million.
“Besides, reports of an operation against more than 50 mosques in Islamabad were not true,” he said.
The state minister responded by saying that he was grateful to the Maulana for playing role of a great scholar in this matter.
He said since January this year, negotiations had continued with the management of the mosque and the seminary, adding that “we have given a new madressah building in the style of modern schools at a place of their choice”.
He said the actual cost of the land and the building given to the madressah amounted to upto Rs150 million.
Mr Chaudhry denied the impression that an understanding with the government had been reached only over the demolition of the madressah, adding that he had the understanding that mosques were present in all madressahs.
He said the new building was completed in July, and the students had been shifted there and they were allowed to take all necessary items, including fans, with them. He said there were 185 students in the madressah.
The state minister also said if there was any construction on the greenbelt or on the way, decision would be made after consultation with the management of that mosque.
He expressed the hope that the issue would be resolved amicably after return of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi from a foreign visit.

Also, a senior administration officer was held hostage at gunpoint before being freed on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil of the district.
The police said unidentified men opened indiscriminate fire on a motorcycle on the Bypass Road, killing riders Mufti Fazlur Rehman and his son, Noor Rehman.
The attackers fled afterward. The police shifted the bodies to the district headquarters hospital in Miramshah.
In another incident, additional assistant commissioner of Razmak Mohammad Younis Yousafzai was held hostage by terrorists for around two hours on the Bypass Road in Mirali tehsil. He was later released.
The terrorists took the officer, along with his guard and driver, into custody and snatched his official vehicle, an AK-47 rifle, a pistol and a 9mm pistol. However, they later fled, leaving the officer and his subordinates behind.
No statement was issued by the district administration on the incident.
Residents resented both incidents, saying at a time when targeted killings and bomb blasts have made the area unsafe, the kidnapping of a government officer in broad daylight shows that the law and order situation has become really bad.
“When the government’s own officers are unsafe, who the people should trust for their safety,” wondered local elder Imran.
The residents demanded that the government take effective measures, arrest criminals and give them severe punishment, besides adopting a “practical strategy” to establish permanent peace in North Waziristan.
TENSE SITUATION: Tensions are running high in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South
Waziristan tribal district as armed groups have blocked key routes, planted improvised explosive devices and frequently exchanged fire with security forces over the last several days.
DSP of Birmal Circle Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that armed men used a tractor to build an embankment Karmazi Stop, sealing off the Azam Warsak Road.
He said the road closure had forced residents to travel on rough tracks and mountainous terrain, making daily commutes difficult and dangerous.
Tribesmen said the blockade had also restricted access to fruit and vegetable markets, badly affecting traders and orchard owners.
Police officials said the area remained tense for six consecutive days, with reports of IEDs planted at multiple points along the road. In recent days, three culverts and a school were blown up.
According to DSP Shah, late-night gunfire by terrorists happens frequently, heightening fear among the residents.
In a separate incident, a 10-year-old girl was critically injured as terrorists and security forces traded fire in the Dazha Ghondai area. She was taken to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for treatment.
Residents have complained about the worsening law and order situation and said for the last 10 nights, intermittent gun battles had taken place, raising fears of civilian casualties.

An official statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday noted that the reduced tariff will create new opportunities for Pakistani exporters to expand their footprint in the US. The development was discussed during a high-level meeting on US reciprocal tariffs, chaired by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.
The meeting was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul, senior officials from the Commerce and Industries Divisions, and more than 30 leading exporters and SMEs from key sectors including apparel, textiles, rice, salt, surgical instruments, sports goods, electronics, food and agriculture, and leather.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.

Islamabad secures the lowest tariffs among regional competitors

Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar highlighted Pakistan’s comparative advantage in the region and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting industry stakeholders in unlocking business potential under evolving global conditions.
 
 

Industry representatives called for consistent and industry-friendly policies to optimise manufacturing costs and secure access to critical inputs. They urged the government to adopt a predictable policy environment that facilitates long-term planning and growth.
Commerce Minister Jam reiterated the government’s focus on export-led growth, stressing both immediate and long-term strategic measures. He assured exporters that their recommendations would be compiled and presented to the Prime Minister for further action.
It was decided to actively pursue the expansion of Pakistan’s export footprint in the US, turning the current tariff reduction into a sustained national advantage for broader socio-economic development.
Separately, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal held a meeting with representatives of Octans Digital Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Interloop Holdings, to discuss sustainability and waste management in Pakistan’s textile industry.

• Police vehicles targeted in Sibi, Quetta
QUETTA: Security forces have gunned down 50 terrorists over the past four days, as they foiled an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan’s Zhob district, said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) in a statement on Tuesday.
In the Sambaza area of Zhob district, 47 terrorists were killed following “successful engagements by security forces” from Aug 7 to 9, it said. In the same area along the Pak-Afghan border, three more “Indian-sponsored” terror­ists were killed during a “saniti­sation operation” on the night of Aug 10-11, it said, adding that arms and ammunitions were seized from their possession.
 
 

The statement referred to these militants as ‘khawarij’, a term used to describe the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban militants. The number of TTP terrorists killed in the four-day operation has risen to fifty,“ the ISPR added.
Nine soldiers martyred
On the other hand, a convoy of security forces was ambushed in the southern Washuk district bord­e­ring Iran on Monday night, lead­ing to the martyrdom of nine pers­o­n­nel, including an officer. The ISPR did not issue a statement by the time this report went to print.
 
 

Six soldiers were also injured in the gun battle between the militants and the security forces in the Basima area of Washuk. Sour­ces said the militants ambu­shed the convoy, and three vehicles came under heavy fire. The secur­ity personnel returned fire, and the battle continued for an hour.
“An officer and eight other secu­rity personnel embraced martyrdom while fighting bravely, and six others sustained injuries,” a senior security official said on the condition of anonymity. He said the injured were shifted to the nearby health facility, adding that casualties also occurred on the other side.
The militants also attempted to attack a police station in Basima recently handed over to the police, but the policemen deployed there repulsed it sucessfully, the official said, adding that the fight continued for half an hour. Three policemen were inju­r­ed. “Blood marks on the ground and a motorbike confirm casualties on the other side,” he claimed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday commended the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in the Sambaza area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, APP reported.
The president and prime minister, in their separately issued statements, “appreciated the security forces for killing 50 Indian-sponsored terrorists in the last four days as a testament to their professionalism, bravery, and determination”.
BLA, Majeed Brigade designation
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office welcomed the United States’ decision to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations, also adding Majeed Brigade as an alias to BLA.
 
 

The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, besides being committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.
Also, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in an interaction with the media in Hyderabad termed the designation of Majeed Brigade and Balochistan Liberation Army by the US a success. He said it was the endorsement of Pakistan’s viewpoint by the US.
He said these separatist outfits openly supported India during May’s Pak-India conflict, adding the UN should make such a declaration as well so that international financing to these outfits could be curtailed.
Quetta and Sibi attacks
Furthermore, a police officer was injured in a grenade attack in Sibi, while a police vehicle on patrol escaped a bomb blast in the provincial capital.
Officials said that an unknown motorcyclist hurled a grenade at a police vehicle in Sibi on Monday night near the Government Girls College. The grenade exploded close to the police vehicle and injured a police officer, who was on snap-checking duty in the area.
In Quetta, a police vehicle escaped a roadside bomb attack that occurred on Link Badini Road near the Eastern Bypass. The explosion, however, destroyed a car which was passing through the area. The man driving remained unhurt. “The target was a police vehicle…but it passed the area a minute before the blast,” a senior police officer said. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.
