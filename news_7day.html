The United States military has hammered the Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15 in an operation dubbed “Rough Rider”, seeking to end the threat they pose to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
The Houthis launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas conducted an unprecedented attack on Israel in October 2023.
On Sunday, the US said it had hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since mid-March, killing hundreds of Houthi rebels, including members of the group’s leadership.
Just hours later, Houthi media said the latest barrage by US forces had hit a migrant detention centre.
“The civil defence has announced that 68 African migrants were killed and 47 others wounded in the US attack targeting a centre for illegal migrants in the city of Saada,” the Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV said.
AFP could not independently confirm the veracity of Al-Masirah’s claim that the strikes had hit a migrant detention centre, or the toll.
AFP has contacted the US military for comment.
According to a statement cited by Al-Masirah from the Houthi administration’s interior ministry, the centre housed “115 migrants, all from Africa”.
The broadcaster showed footage of bodies stuck under the rubble and of rescuers working to help the casualties.
Each year, tens of thousands of migrants brave the Eastern Route from the Horn of Africa, seeking to escape conflict, natural disasters and poor economic prospects by sailing across the Red Sea towards the oil-rich Gulf.
Many hope for employment as labourers or domestic workers in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries, though they face a perilous journey through war-torn Yemen.
The UN migration agency (IOM) said it was closely monitoring the situation following the latest strike, but said the facility in question was not being managed by their personnel.
“It is imperative that all efforts are made to avoid harm to civilians and to protect those most vulnerable in these challenging circumstances,” the IOM said in a statement.
We will continue
The Houthis began targeting shipping in late 2023, preventing ships from passing through the Suez Canal — a vital route that normally carries about 12 per cent of global trade — forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.
In a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far, the US military command responsible for the Middle East said: “Since the start of Operation Rough Rider, USCENTCOM has struck over 800 targets.
“These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders. The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defence systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,” Centcom (US Central Command) said.
Despite the strikes, the Houthis, who control large swaths of Yemen, have continued to claim attacks against both US vessels and Israel.
Centcom said that “while the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69pc. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55pc.
“Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,” the military command said.
“We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,” it added.
Strikes on Sanaa
Al-Masirah TV on Sunday reported that US strikes on the rebel-held Yemeni capital Sanaa had killed at least eight people and wounded others.
The channel also broadcast footage of the rubble of destroyed homes and cars, as well as blood stains on the ground, while rescuers collected what appeared to be human remains in white cloth.
Also on Sunday, Houthi media said earlier strikes on Sanaa had killed two people and wounded several more.
The United States first began conducting strikes against the Houthis under Joe Biden’s administration, and President Donald Trump has vowed that military action against the rebels will continue until they are no longer a threat to shipping.</p><small>2025-04-28 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28181704261aaca.jpg?r=182245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907149/massive-blackout-hits-spain-portugal-france' target='_blank'><strong>Massive blackout hits Spain, Portugal, France</strong></a><br><p>A massive blackout hit Spain, Portugal and part of southern France on Monday, grid operators said, leaving millions of people affected.
The cause for the outage was not immediately reported.
Spain’s railway operator Adif said that the power cut halted trains across the entire country, while airports operator Aena said “several incidents” occurred in Spanish airports.
Mobile phone networks went down. AFP reporters in Madrid and Barcelona saw many inhabitants coming out into the streets, holding their smartphones up to try to connect to a network.
Many people had to use the radio instead of the inaccessible internet to get news
on the situation.
Many traffic lights had ceased to function, forcing vehicles to slow down to avoid collisions, while metros and trains were halted. Spain’s national road authority DGT urged motorists to stop using the roads.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was on his way to the headquarters of the state electricity network operator Red Electrica to be briefed on the emergency, his office said.
Portugal’s REN operator said in a statement to AFP that the entire Iberian Peninsula was affected by the blackout, as well as part of France, adding that the outage occurred at 11:33am.
Spain’s Red Electrica said it had managed to start restoring power in the north and south of the country but the problem was not yet resolved. “We are continuing to work to bring back power,” it said.
Spain’s El Pais newspaper posted photos on its website of stopped metro trains in Madrid, police directing traffic, and its own reporters working in a darkened office by the torchlight.
Power cut interrupts play at Madrid Open
Play was interrupted at the Madrid Open on Monday when the city lost power, after world number four Coco Gauff and rising Russian star Mirra Andreeva booked their quarter-final spots.
On Centre Court, the match between Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov and British qualifier Jacob Fearnley was suspended when the Bulgarian was leading 6-4, 5-4 with his opponent serving to stay in the match.
“The outage is preventing the use of electronic line calling systems and also left a spider cam dangling over the court inside Monolo Santana Stadium,” the ATP said on its website.
Tournament organisers said on social media they were “working to restore” power “as quickly as possible”, without giving a timetable.
 





</p><small>2025-04-28 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/281449038b609eb.png?r=145045' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>China urges India, Pakistan to exercise restraint after Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>China on Monday urged India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC) for a fourth night in a row in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“China hopes that the two sides will exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
“China welcomes all measures that will help cool down the situation,” Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
The statement came after Pakistan and India reportedly exchanged gunfire for a fourth night in a row across the LoC, after four years of relative calm.
“During the night of April 27-28… Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control”, the Indian army claimed in a statement.
 
 

There were no reported casualties, and Islamabad did not immediately confirm the gunfire.
India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Some of these are routine preparedness drills, Reuters quoted a defence official as saying.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
 
 

On Thursday, Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to pursue the attackers to the “ends of the earth” and said that those who planned and carried out the attack “will be punished beyond their imagination”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” in an international probe into the Pahalgam attack, but also warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Separately, ex-foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari said today that if India was committed to combatting terrorism, “they should agree to talking and having dialogue with Pakistan”.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

In an interview with Deutsche Welle (DW), the PPP chairman said: “We want to combat terrorism. […] We can only work together to combat terrorism.”
Bilawal said that Pakistan had offered to be part of any impartial inquiry into the incident, stating that the country also wanted “the truth to get out”.
“Pakistan is sick and tired of the Modi government scapegoating Pakistan for every single security failure within India,” the former foreign minister said.
US in touch with India and Pakistan, urges work toward ‘responsible solution’
China’s call for restraint added to the United States’ statement from Sunday, urging India and Pakistan to work towards what it called a “responsible solution”, as Washington said it was in touch with both countries.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
 
 

The State Department spokesperson also said Washington “stands with India and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”, reiterating comments similar to recent ones made by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan. While Saudi Arabia and Iran have offered to mediate, Trump last week said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
India is an increasingly important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence in Asia while Pakistan remains a US ally, even as its importance for Washington has diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said India is now a much closer US partner than Pakistan.
“This may worry Islamabad that if India retaliates militarily, the US may sympathise with its counterterrorism imperatives and not try to stand in the way,” Kugelman told Reuters.
Kugelman also said that given Washington’s involvement and ongoing diplomatic efforts in Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, the Trump administration is “dealing with a lot on its global plate” and may leave India and Pakistan on their own, at least in the early days of the tensions.
Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, also said that there seemed to be no US appetite to calm the situation at this moment.
 
 

“India has a longstanding grievance about terrorism emanating or supported from across [the] border. Pakistan has a longstanding belief that India wants to dismember it. Both work themselves into a frenzy every few years. This time, there is no US interest in calming things down,” Haqqani said.
Ned Price, a former US State Department official under the administration of former president Joe Biden, said that while the Trump administration was giving this issue the sensitivity it deserved, a perception that it would back India at any cost may escalate tensions further.
“The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to deepen the US-India partnership a laudable goal but that it is willing to do so at almost any cost.
“If India feels that the Trump administration will back it to the hilt no matter what, we could be in store for more escalation and more violence between these nuclear-armed neighbours,” Price added.
2,000 detained as Indian forces continue crackdown
Meanwhile, Indian soldiers have blown up nine homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris and detained nearly 2,000 people since the Pahalgam attack, sparking public anger and accusations of “collective punishment”.

Police have launched a vast manhunt and detained a long list of suspects for questioning, including nearly 2,000 residents across the territory, a senior police official told AFP.
“It’s a revolving door in police stations as part of the ongoing investigation,” the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.
“Some have already been let go, and more are being summoned to police stations,” the officer added. “These are not arrests, just for seeking information that could lead to the terrorists,” the official insisted.
Security forces have searched nearly 1,000 houses and forests hunting for the attackers in India-held Kashmir, a local police official told Reuters on Monday.
 
 

Political leaders in the state have called for caution to ensure the innocent are not harmed in the government’s actions against terrorism.
“It’s time to … avoid any misplaced action that alienates people. Punish the guilty, show them no mercy but don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” Omar Abdullah, the territory’s chief minister said on X on Saturday.
Another former chief minister made an appeal to the Indian government “to take care that innocent people are not made to feel the brunt as alienation aids terrorists’ goals of division and fear”.
Aga Ruhullah, a federal lawmaker from occupied Kashmir, said: “Kashmir and Kashmiris are being given a collective punishment”.

“The oil tanker was parked at a truck depot when it caught fire, injuring at least 40 people,” Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Soomro told Dawn.com, adding that the fire was caused by welding work on the tanker.
“The fire brigade was trying to control the fire when the truck exploded,” DC Soomro said, adding that fire brigade personnel were seriously injured as a result.
He said that four police personnel present a the scene to move citizens away were also injured, while those near the oil tanker suffered 70 to 80 per cent burns.
“Those with severe burns will be shifted to Quetta via helicopter,” DC Soomro said.
In a statement, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind noted that over 30 people were burned in the incident.
“The fire was so intense it engulfed the fire brigade vehicle present at the scene,” Rind was quoted as saying. “There are reports of more than 30 people being burned in the accident.
“The injured are being shifted to the Civil Hospital and BMC (Bolan Medical College) after [receiving] first aid,” he said, adding that an emergency had been declared in hospitals.
“The incident is unfortunate … investigations are being conducted,” Rind was quoted as saying.
Oil tanker explosions frequently result from high-impact collisions. Beyond crashes, explosions can stem from defective fuel tanks, overloaded tanks, faulty muffler systems sparking fires, or various other issues. Given that tankers transport highly flammable or hazardous materials, accidents are not unexpected.
Last year, a man was killed while five others were injured in an oil tanker explosion in Karachi’s Shireen Jinnah Colony near the terminals of the 20-bus route.  Police said some workers were welding under the oil tanker, which was empty of oil, but some gases had accumulated in it, leading to the explosion.
In 2017, 212 people were killed when a tanker carrying 40,000 litres of fuel overturned after trying to make a sharp turn while travelling from Karachi to Lahore on the main highway. The incident occurred when hundreds of residents of a nearby village gathered at the site of the overturned oil tanker to collect the leaking fuel.
According to initial investigations, a cigarette was suspected to have caused the massive blaze that engulfed the people collecting the spilled fuel.</p><small>2025-04-28 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/281702443e56219.png?r=170428' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907136/blast-at-peace-committee-office-kills-7-in-kps-south-waziristan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Blast at peace committee office kills 7 in KP’s South Waziristan: police</strong></a><br><p>A blast at a peace committee office in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan tribal district on Monday killed at least seven people, police and health officials said.
While no one has claimed responsibility for the blast, the security situation in KP has continued to deteriorate, particularly after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase its attacks against the security forces.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on Monday.
“Five of the injured are in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition is not critical”.
KP Health Adviser Ehtesham Ali condemned the blast in a statement and said that seven bodies had been transferred to the hospital.
“Around 15 injured have been brought to the hospital,” Ethesham said. “The injured are receiving treatment and an emergency has been declared in the hospital. Staff leaves have been suspended.”
Meanwhile, the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) in Wana confirmed that seven bodies were brought to the hospital after the blast, but the list issued by the hospital stated that a total of nine people were injured.
Thick black smoke was visible in the photos from the scene posted on social media.
 






Senator Sherry Rehman published a statement on X condemning the blast, calling the attack “a cowardly act”.
“I am deeply saddened by the loss of six lives,” she wrote. “Targeting innocent civilians is a cowardly act and terrorists who target the innocent do not deserve any leniency.”
Sherry added: “No matter what the terrorists do, they cannot break the resolve of the security forces and the brave public.”
 






Peace committees have existed in the area since 2007, such as that led by Mullah Nazir which was assigned the task of evicting Uzbek, Tajiks and other foreign fighters from the area.
Mullah Nazir was killed along with his 10 associates in a US drone strike in the Birmil area of South Wazi­ristan Agency in January 2013.</p><small>2025-04-28 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28153912005f8ee.png?r=154448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907126/security-forces-kill-17-more-terrorists-operating-at-behest-of-indian-masters-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 17 more terrorists operating at ‘behest of Indian masters’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 17 terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the military’s media wing said on Monday.
A day ago, the forces had neutralised 54 terrorists  while they were attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the same region. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), this is the highest-ever number of terrorists killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
According to an ISPR statement issued today, “a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Hassan Khel, North Waziristan District, along Pakistan-Afghanistan Border.
“During the conduct of the operation, seventeen more khawarij, who were operating [at] behest of their Indian masters, were hunted down and successfully neutralised,” ISPR said.
The ISPR added that a large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the slain khawarij, a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
“The number of khwarij killed in three days anti [infiltration] operation has risen to 71,” it added.
The security forces remain committed to securing the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging the peace, stability and progress of Pakistan, the statement said.
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operation in North Waziristan.
According to Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), the president and the prime minister lauded the bravery of the security forces in separate statements.
The president reaffirmed to continuation of security operations until the complete eradication of terrorism.
“The successful operations by our security forces against terrorists are commendable,” the president said, vowing to uphold the unwavering commitment to the defence of the country and the elimination of terrorism.
The premier pointed out, “The killing of 71 Khawarij terrorists during the security operations in North Waziristan over the past three days clearly shows that our law enforcement agencies are fully determined and vigilant in their mission to eliminate terrorism.”
“We will continue to thwart the nefarious designs of these terrorists (enemies of humanity), in the same resolute manner,” he said, expressing the determination to continue the war against terrorism until the complete eradication of terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-28 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28170140758c134.jpg?r=171809' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907138/putin-announces-surprise-ukraine-truce-for-may-8-10' target='_blank'><strong>Putin announces surprise Ukraine truce for May 8-10</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a surprise three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, coinciding with Moscow’s World War II Victory Day commemorations, the Kremlin said on Monday.
Moscow said it expected Kyiv to issue a similar order, and that it stood ready to respond to any violations of the possible halt in fighting.
Putin made a similar order to stop combat over Easter — a truce that both sides accused the other of violating hundreds of times, but did lead to a temporary reduction in fighting.
“The Russian side is declaring a ceasefire during the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, from midnight on May 7-8 to midnight on May 10-11. All combat operations will be suspended during this period,” the Kremlin said in a statement.

“Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example. In the event of violations of the truce by the Ukrainian side, the Russian armed forces will give an adequate and effective response,” it added.
Putin last month rejected a US proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire that had been accepted by Ukraine.
Kyiv and its European backers accused Putin of announcing the 30-hour Easter truce as a PR exercise and said he had little desire for peace.
Since launching its Ukraine offensive in February 2022, Russia has seized large parts of four Ukrainian regions and claimed them as its own, in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.
‘Tapping me along’
Putin’s order of a ceasefire comes at the beginning of what the United States indicated would be a crucial week for the chances of a ceasefire that could determine how long Washington keeps trying to broker a deal.
After a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday, Donald Trump questioned whether the Russian leader was serious about peace.
“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along,” Trump had said on Truth Social.
 


Russian missiles have killed dozens of civilians over the last month in large-scale strikes on Zelensky’s home city of Kryvyi Rig, the northeastern city of Sumy and the capital Kyiv.
Russia had earlier on Monday said it was ready to negotiate directly with Ukraine, but that recognition of its claims over five Ukrainian regions, including Crimea, were “imperative” to resolving the conflict.
Ukraine has denounced the annexations as an illegal land grab and says it will never recognise them, while European officials have warned that accepting Moscow’s demands set a dangerous precedent that could lead to future Russian aggression.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with Brazilian newspaper O Globo published  on Monday that “we remain open to negotiations.”
“But the ball is not in our court. So far, Kyiv has not demonstrated its ability to negotiate,” he said, adding Moscow’s position on the conflict was “well-known”.
“International recognition of Russia’s ownership of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Lugansk People’s Republic, the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions is imperative,” he said, using the Kremlin’s names for the Ukrainian regions.
Zelensky said last Friday that Ukraine would “not legally recognise any temporarily occupied territories”, and has previously called the demilitarisation demand “incomprehensible”.
Kursk retaken
Trump, who boasted before his inauguration that he could halt Russia’s assault on Ukraine within “24 hours”, launched a diplomatic offensive to stop the fighting after taking office in January.
But the White House has voiced frustration with both sides, as the conflict that has devastated swathes of eastern Ukraine and killed tens of thousands of people drags on.
Russia and Ukraine have not held direct talks on the fighting since the start of Moscow’s offensive in 2022.
Early Monday, a Russian attack on a Ukrainian village near the frontline city of Pokrovsk killed a married couple and another local resident, regional prosecutors said.
Meanwhile, Russia over the weekend announced it had taken full control of its Kursk region with the help of North Korean troops, more than eight months after Kyiv launched a cross-border ground assault.
Putin thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday for help with the operation, which has denied Kyiv a key bargaining chip in future talks with Moscow.
The Russian army said on Monday it had taken control of the village of Kamianka in the northeastern Kharkiv region, in its latest battlefield advance.</p><small>2025-04-28 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28125916afbfcc2.png?r=132128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907114/16-pakistani-youtube-channels-banned-in-india-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>16 Pakistani YouTube channels banned in India after Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Indian government has banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels on recommendations from its Ministry of Home Affairs, Pakistani and Indian media outlets reported on Monday.
Tensions have risen between the two Asian nations following a recent attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).

India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The YouTube channels blocked by the Indian authorities include those of Dawn News, Samaa TV, ARY News, Geo News, Bol News, Suno News and Raftar.
Journalists whose channels were banned included Irshad Bhatti, Asma Shirazi, Umar Cheema, Muneeb Farooq and Rizwan Razi.
Dawn.com confirmed that these YouTube channels could not be accessed in India.
No authority or official in Pakistan has commented on the matter so far.
The sites were blocked in India on Monday, with a message reading it was due to an “order from the government related to national security or public order”.
Even renowned former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar’s channel was not spared. Uzair Cricket was another commentary channel reportedly banned in India.
 


The Pakistan Experience, a podcast channel by content creator Shehzad Ghias, said it was also banned in India.
“Is our minor podcast a national security risk?” it quipped in a post on X, sharing a screenshot of a message by YouTube addressed to the podcast account.
“In my opinion, Uzair Younus and I did quite a sensible balanced discussion on the issue. There is nothing in this podcast that warranted us getting banned in India,” Ghias asserted on X, sharing a link to the video titled ‘Are India and Pakistan about to go to war? - The aftermath of the Pahalgam incident’.
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claimed that these YouTube channels were pushing “false narratives” against India, its army and security agencies.
The Indian authorities further alleged that these channels were spreading “provocative, communally sensitive” content aimed at “inciting communal tensions”.
Indian news agency ANI shared the list on its X account.
 


On April 24, a day after India announced a slew of measures, Indian media reported that the Modi-led regime had blocked the Pakistani government’s X account in the country as tensions escalated between the neighbours.</p><small>2025-04-28 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28164558fde8d87.jpg?r=164707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907131/fact-check-viral-video-of-massive-fire-at-lahore-airport-is-old-from-may-2024' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video of massive fire at Lahore airport is old from May 2024</strong></a><br><p>Multiple Indian media outlets and social media users have been sharing a video of Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport since Saturday, claiming that a missile battery of the Air Defence System exploded during installation, resulting in the suspension of all services at the airport. However, the incident is from May 2024 when a short circuit in the ceiling caused smoke and flight delays.
An attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer, on April 22. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000. A hitherto unknown group, named by several Indian outlets as ‘The Resistance Front’, is said to have claimed responsibility for the attack.
India followed suit by announcing a series of actions against Pakistan. Responding in kind, Pakistan’s top brass also announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect.
As diplomatic channels dry up and treaty frameworks teeter, analysts warn that relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours may be approaching a dangerous tipping point, with limited space remaining for de-escalation.
On Saturday, a known Indian propaganda account posted a 32-second long clip showing a crowd with suitcases standing at the airport covered with smoke.
The caption of the post said, “Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore, Pakistan is burning after a missile battery of Air Defence System exploded during installation. Fourteen Pakistani soldiers died due to this incident. All services have been suspended at Lahore airport and the Pakistan Army has taken control.”
The post gained 479,400 views.
The same video with similar captions was shared by Indian as well Pakistani and Afghani accounts on X which can be seen here, here, here, here and here with 19,200, 52,600, 295,400, 54,700, and 6,200 views respectively.
Indian media outlets such as Financial Express, ABP News, News Arena India, Kalinga Tv and Lokmat Times also reported the same incident on Saturday.
The same clip was also shared by Facebook users as can be seen here, here, and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the events unfolding between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam attack.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged development yielded no news stories regarding any recent fire at the airport or the deaths of soldiers and the suspension of operations.
A reverse image search yielded a Pakistan Today report published on May 9, 2024, that featured a screenshot from the viral video.
According to the report, a fire erupted at Allama Iqbal International Airport due to a short circuit in the ceiling of the immigration counter, leading to delays in both Haj and international flights.
The screenshot was also featured in a YouTube news bulletin from Indian channel CNN-News18 on May 9, 2024.
 


Several other reports published by Pakistani, as well as Indian media outlets, were also found on the actual incident.
A keyword search also yielded a statement from the Pakistan Airports Authority, published by state news outlet The Associated Press of Pakistan, rejecting the reports about the suspension of operations.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows a massive fire at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal Airport, resulting in flight cancellations, is misleading.  The clip actually dates back to May 2024, when fire and smoke from a short circuit in the airport’s ceiling led to flight delays.

“We have signed the deal for 26 Rafale jets,” a spokesperson for India’s defence ministry told AFP.
When delivered, the jets would join 36 French-made Rafale fighters already acquired by New Delhi as part of its efforts to rapidly modernise its military hardware.
 






The Indian government first announced its intention to procure 26 Rafales in 2023, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited France for the Bastille Day celebrations.
The jets made by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation are expected to operate from Indian-made aircraft carriers, replacing the Russian MiG-29K jets.
“The Rafale-Marine is a carrier-borne combat-ready aircraft with proven operational capabilities in a maritime environment. The delivery of these aircraft would be completed by 2030, with the crew undergoing training in France and India,” the statement by the Indian Ministry of Defence said.
Indian media reports suggest that the deal would include training, equipment, weapons and other related logistical support for the Indian military.
Despite historical ties with Russia as its key supplier for military equipment, India has diversified with key purchases including from France as well as from the United States and Israel.
It also marks another step in India’s long-standing reliance on French military hardware, including Mirage 2000 jets bought in the 1980s and Scorpene-class submarines ordered in 2005.

The World Bank had predicted Pakistan’s economy to grow by 2.8 per cent during the current fiscal year in its Pakistan Development Update (PDU), released in October last year. However, the Bank last week slightly lowered its growth forecast for the country to 2.7pc for the current fiscal year, citing continued economic stabilisation but persistent constraints from tight monetary and fiscal policies.
“After inheriting an economy facing significant challenges —from contracting GDP (gross domestic product) to depleting reserves—we have stabilised the fundamentals, restored confidence, and reignited growth,” the report quoted the finance minister as saying.
Speaking at length about the country’s economic growth, the finance minister outlined a few key achievements, including “a historic reduction in inflation to 0.7pc, the lowest in 60 years; doubling of foreign exchange reserves; a 3pc currency appreciation; and a current account surplus exceeding $1 billion in March 2025”, the report added.
He further said that in the current fiscal year, Pakistan saw a 44pc increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) along with a 24pc rise in IT exports. He also highlighted record-high remittances — currently projected at $38bn.
Aurangzeb noted that, following Fitch’s upgrade of Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to B-, the country achieved its highest fiscal surplus in 24 years
He also highlighted Pakistan’s success in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 75pc to 67.2pc, adding that Pakistan planned to bring it below 60pc over the medium term via “prudent fiscal management, enhanced domestic financing, and tax reforms.”
With a focus on transparency, competitive processes, and investor confidence, he explained that rightsizing government expenditures and privatising loss-making state-owned enterprises will save up to 2pc of GDP annually.
As per the report, “He also laid out plans to build a deeper and more resilient system by expanding digital banking, capital markets and green finance.”
Emphasising that “stability is not an end but a means to an end, “ the finance minister outlined the government’s strategy, including maintaining fiscal discipline, controlling inflation, and pushing ahead with deep structural reforms in energy, taxation, governance, and the management of state-owned enterprises, the report added.
Stressing the need for strengthening human development, he identified opportunities in sectors such as the IT sector and green energy initiatives, maintaining that human development was “critical to sustaining high, inclusive growth”.
In his concluding remarks, the finance minister said, “Pakistan’s future will be shaped by bold, necessary choices. By investing in our people, modernising our economy, and staying committed to reform, Pakistan will emerge stronger, greener, and more competitive.”
The 2025 conference about Pakistan, titled “Bridging Divides, Building Tomorrow: Pakistan’s Path to Inclusive Growth and Governance,” is an annual Harvard event — the largest student-led conference on Pakistan in the United States — aimed at discussing the political, economical and social trajectory of Pakistan. The forum brings together policymakers, business leaders, academics and students.
“The conference serves as a vital forum to advance collaborative solutions, promote global engagement, and showcase the creativity and resilience of the Pakistani people,” as per the report.</p><small>2025-04-28 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/281004251c52f9d.jpg?r=101435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907093/shares-at-psx-shed-1400-points-as-pakistan-india-tensions-loom' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX shed 1,400 points as Pakistan-India tensions loom</strong></a><br><p>Bears took control of the trade floor on Monday as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) reversed their short-lived gains in intraday trade, declining more than 1,400 points after a week of volatility due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed by 941.79 points, or 0.82 per cent, to stand at 116,411.13 from the previous close of 115,469.34 at 10:05am.
However, at 3:03pm, selling pressure ensued as the index decreased by 969.19 points, or 0.84pc, to stand at 114,500.15 from the previous close.
Finally, the index closed at 114,063.90, down by 1,405.44 points or 1.22pc, from the last close.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Corporate results of heavyweight companies caused the index to fluctuate in today’s trading session.
“While investors remained cautious due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India,” he added.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said,“Though some buying was seen in the morning session amid no major development on Pak-India front, investors remained cautious fearing that coming few days seem crucial in the ongoing tension between the two neighbours.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “The market opened slightly higher today and then pulled back as initial excitement faded.”
On a positive note, Farooq said that market sentiment was supported by relief that “no major escalation” occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend, along with the country’s monthly current account “in a comfortable position” and corporations “posting strong profits”.
In other positive developments, Farooq added that inflation was at a record low, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood at 101.
“The market opened slightly higher today, supported by relief that no major escalation occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend [following the Pahalgam attack],” he added.
“With most market participants expecting interest rate cuts ahead, there is potential for a rerating of the market’s PE [price-to-earning] multiple,” he said.
“However, a significant upward move will likely require de-escalation between India and Pakistan.”
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations had unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
AKD Securities noted that the market had remained volatile last week due to escalating geopolitical tensions following the Pahalgam attack, and India’s subsequent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan in the aftermath of the incident, undermining investor sentiment.</p><small>2025-04-28 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/281348000930cfc.jpg?r=142249' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907121/five-of-a-family-die-as-jeep-plunges-into-ravine-in-mansehra' target='_blank'><strong>Five of a family die as jeep plunges into ravine in Mansehra</strong></a><br><p>Five members of a family died and seven others were injured when a Jabori-bound jeep plunged into a ravine in the Sundi area of Mansehra district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday, police said.
Most parts of Battal, Shenkiari, and Upper Mansehra in the district comprise of mountainous, hard terrain with roads with sharp turns, and traffic accidents frequently occur on these roads due to their bad condition.
“The jeep was heading towards the Jabori area when the driver lost control and it plunged into a deep ravine, resulting in the death of four on the spot, while one injured person succumbed on the way to the hospital,”
Nawazabad police station Station House Officer (SHO) Abdul Waheed told Dawn.com.
According to the SHO, seven other people were injured in the incident and have been shifted to the Shenkiari Rural Health Centre. The critically injured among them were moved to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital in Mansehra city.
Waheed said three women, a child and a young man were among the deceased.
“Nine [Including the deceased and injured] were from the same family, and three others were local residents from the nearby localities of Sundi, he added.
The SHO continued that the bodies had been handed over to their relatives, and the injured were undergoing treatment at the hospital.
Earlier in the month, Japan’s Ambassador to Pakistan Akamatsu Shuichi remained safe after being involved in a road accident in Mansehra.
The mishap occurred after the brakes of the vehicle the ambassador was travelling in failed, leading to a collision with a police escort van, which subsequently fell into a deep ravine in the Makriha Jandwal area.</p><small>2025-04-28 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28131016d8450ef.gif?r=133443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907120/canada-votes-for-new-government-to-take-on-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Canada votes for new government to take on Trump</strong></a><br><p>Canada elects a new government on Monday to confront annexation threats from the United States and deal directly with US President Donald Trump, whose trade war has defined the campaign.
The Liberal Party, led by new Prime Minister Mark Carney, looked set to lose easily to the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre until the US president’s attacks on the country sparked a sudden reversal in poll forecasts.
Carney, 60, has never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month. He had a lucrative career as an investment banker before serving as the central bank governor in both Canada and Britain.
 
 

Carney has argued his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada’s response to Trump’s tariffs.
He has also promised to revitalize internal trade and expand Canada’s economic opportunities abroad to cut reliance on the United States, a country Carney says “we can no longer trust.”
The United States under Trump “wants to break us, so they can own us,” he has warned repeatedly through the campaign.
“We don’t need chaos, we need calm. We don’t need anger, we need an adult,” Carney said in the campaign’s closing days.
Poilievre, a 45-year-old career politician, has tried to keep the focus on domestic concerns that made Trudeau deeply unpopular toward the end of his decade in power, especially soaring living costs.
The Tory leader has argued Carney would bring a continuation of what he calls “the lost Liberal decade,” arguing that only a new Conservative government can take action against crime, housing shortages and other non-Trump issues Canadians rank as priorities.
“You cannot handle another four years of this,” he said over the weekend.
Poilievre has critiqued Trump, but insisted ten years of poor Liberal governance had left Canada vulnerable to a newly hostile United States.
A good pick
Final polls indicate a tight race but put Carney as the favourite.
Surveys have also consistently shown voters view the ex-central banker as the best candidate to deal with Trump.
Jeff Sims, who lives in Quebec near Canada’s capital Ottawa, said he believes Carney has “the pedigree” to be prime minister.
“Two central banks under his belt, I think that’s a good pick,” the 46-year-old told AFP on Sunday.
At a weekend Conservative rally in the battleground city of Oakville, west of Toronto, Janice Wyner rejected the notion that Carney marked a departure from Trudeau.
Trudeau’s “policies stunk and it’s the same party,” she told AFP.
“Canada is just in a mess. I’m 70 years old. It’s not even a country that I recognize and I’m worried for my grandkids.”
Like many voters, Nadine Sokol, a 41-year-old who also lives near Ottawa, listed “the threat coming from the US” as her “number one issue.”
Historic turnaround
If the Liberals win, it would mark one of the most of dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.
On January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, and Poilievre looked on track to be Canada’s next prime minister.
But Carney replacing Trudeau combined with nationwide unease about Trump transformed the race.
Public broadcaster CBC’s poll aggregator on Sunday put the Liberals’ national support at 42.8 per cent, with the Conservatives at 38.8pc.
As with US elections, national polling numbers may not predict a result.
The performance of two smaller parties — the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) and the separatist Bloc Quebecois — will be closely watched.
In past elections, strong NDP performances in Ontario and British Columbia, and a good showing by the Bloc in Quebec, have curbed Liberal seat tallies, but polls suggest both smaller parties could be facing a setback.
Nearly 29 million of Canada’s estimated 41m people are eligible to vote. A record 7.3m people cast advanced ballots.
In the massive G7 country which spans six times zones, polls open at 8:30am local time (4pm PKT) in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Canadians will elect 343 members of parliament, meaning 172 seats are needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.</p><small>2025-04-28 08:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28113131dbb3f89.jpg?r=120522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907108/cci-meeting-to-decide-canals-issue-to-be-held-today-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>CCI meeting to decide canals issue to be held today: Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has convened a meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for today (Monday) to discuss the matter of the much-contested six new canals on the Indus River, according to Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz inaugurated the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate South Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh.
After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh, the federal government on April 23 announced it was halting the contentious project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the CCI. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) last week.
While the government had earlier decided to convene the CCI meeting on May 2, Memon said today that the huddle had been moved earlier and would be held in the evening today.
“[Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif] has summoned a meeting of the CCI today on the request of the Sindh government,” Memon said in a statement issued by his spokesperson Husain Mansoor.
 


“The CCI meeting chaired by the prime minister will be held in Islamabad in the evening today,” the statement said, adding that a decision on the canals’ matter will be made there.
“Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah will attend the meeting on behalf of Sindh,” Memon confirmed.
“A decision will be made as per the discussion between [PPP Chairman] Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the prime minister, and the issue of canals will end,” he said, referring to Friday’s meeting between the coalition allies.
The scheduling of the meeting earlier comes amid increasing concerns of traders and the business community as protests against the project have paralysed interprovincial traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh.
 
 

The legal fraternity has been staging a sit-in at the Babarloi bypass in Sindh’s Khairpur district since April 18.
Speaking to Geo News, Memon confirmed that the Sindh government had made the request for the meeting to be moved ahead due to the ongoing protests.
The minister noted that the CCI meeting was to be called on May 2, but despite that, “some groups refused to end the protests until the CCI meeting happens and its [decision’s] formal announcement” is made.
“In light of that, the Sindh government requested the prime minister to summon the meeting today, and it is set to take place in the evening in Islamabad,” Memon added.
 


Responding to a query, he said the provincial government had requested earlier as well to call the meeting “soon but considering the state of the country at the moment, it was difficult”.
“We had to appeal again as transport had come to a halt due to the protests, resulting in economic loss for businesses as well as farmers,” the minister stressed.
Asked about the Sindh government’s plan of action if the protests on highways continued even after the CCI meeting, Memon said: “We are hopeful that if we don’t give them an excuse, even though there was no excuse before either, but the government believes in dialogue.”
He highlighted, “The public interest is important to us at the moment as it was creating issues for the business community and the farmers.”
In a statement posted by the Sindh Information Department on X today, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said the government acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but requested the lawyers not to create difficulties for the public.
He asserted that no legal action would be taken against those protesting peacefully and urged the lawyers to “keep an eye on miscreants around them”.
 






Transporters to hold protest outside Sindh CM House today
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance (APGTA) has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House in Karachi at 4pm today (Monday).
Yesterday, Nisar Jafry of the APGTA said he had received a call from Memon — also Sindh’s transport minister — requesting him to call off today’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
Jafry said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded. He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be they meant for import, export or locally produced.
 
 

In his statement, Memon had called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Manufacturers said they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The past few months have seen nationwide protests from political parties, including the ruling coalition ally PPP, and residents against the proposed project. The Sindh Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution against the project in March.</p><small>2025-04-28 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2812450608ed64b.jpg?r=124630' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907112/brics-set-to-meet-over-trump-trade-policies' target='_blank'><strong>Brics set to meet over Trump trade policies</strong></a><br><p>Senior diplomats from Brics countries will meet on Monday in Brazil to present a united front in the face of threats emerging from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies.
The meeting comes at a critical moment for the world economy after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week slashed growth forecasts over the impact of the American leader’s sweeping new tariffs.
Diplomats from the trading bloc that includes current president Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will meet for two days in Rio de Janeiro, as a precursor to a leaders summit in July.
“The ministers are negotiating a declaration aimed at reaffirming the centrality and importance of the multilateral trading system,” Brazil’s Brics representative Mauricio Lyrio told reporters Saturday.
The group has expanded significantly since its inception in 2009 — and now includes Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. It makes up nearly half of the global population and 39 per cent of global GDP.
Trump since returning to the White House in January has hit dozens of countries with a blanket 10pc tariff, but China faces levies of up to 145 percent on many products. Beijing has responded with duties of 125 percent on US goods.
Trump has threatened to impose 100pc tariffs on Brics countries if they undercut the US dollar.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira will host the meeting that will be attended by Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi among others.
It is scheduled to begin at around 11:00am (1400 GMT) with a statement expected in the afternoon.
Climate change is expected to feature high on the agenda ahead of the United Nations COP30 climate summit in November hosted by Brazil in the Amazonian city of Belem.
The group is also likely to discuss the war in Ukraine, as Trump seeks to push Russia and Ukraine toward a peace agreement.
The Brics will be joined for discussions on Tuesday by nine other “partner” countries, including several former Soviet states, as well as Cuba, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda and Nigeria.
China says ‘no phone call’ recently between Xi and Trump
Beijing insisted that “no phone call” took place recently between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, after Donald Trump said he had spoken with the Chinese leader.
The world’s two biggest economies are locked in an escalating tit-for-tat trade battle triggered by Trump’s levies on Chinese goods, which have reached 145pc on many products.
In an interview conducted on April 22 with TIME Magazine and published Friday, Trump insisted Chinese leader Xi called him despite Beijing denying there had been any contact between the two countries over their bitter trade dispute.
The US president did not say when the call took place or specify what was discussed.
Asked about the comments Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said: “As far as I know, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently.”
“China and the United States are not conducting consultations or negotiations on tariff issues,” he added.</p><small>2025-04-28 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/680ecec5944b9.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906986/hbl-psl-2025-batters-faheem-give-quetta-gladiators-huge-win-over-peshawar-zalmi' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025 : Batters, Faheem give Quetta Gladiators huge win over Peshawar Zalmi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Quetta Gladi­ators looked much more compact than Peshawar Zalmi in all departments here Sunday night at the Gaddafi Stadium as the former recorded a comprehensive 64-run win to boost their campaign in the Pakistan Super League.
The way an animated Mohammad Amir trapped Zalmi captain Babar Azam in front of the wicket as his team looked to chase 179, showed how well prepared Gladiators were for the game. If their top five batters made useful contributions, their fast bowlers, particularly Faheem Ashraf (5-33), were spot on.
The win lifted Gladia­tors, who recorded their second consecutive win of this PSL season, to third in the six-team league while Zalmi slid to fifth spot.
 


Saim Ayub’s cracking shot over cover on the very first ball of the opening over bowled by Amir signalled that Zalmi were ready and positive for the challenge. However, that was not to be.
Saim (five) was caught by wicket-keeper Kusal Men­­dis off fast bowler Faheem Ashraf in the second over as the batter tried unsuccessfully to play a fast rising delivery. Zalmi were 17-1.
Babar’s departure in the next over delivered by Amir proved a massive setback for Zalmi. The former Pakistan captain failed to negotiate a typical swinging ball from the left-armer that came in sharply. The batter opted for DRS that showed ball would have hit top of middle-stump.
When pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr disturbed the timber behind Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who missed the line of the delivery while trying to play through the onside, it made 33-3 in the fifth over. Mohammad Haris started his cameo with a six on the very first ball he faced from Amir.
A dismal 41-3 at the end of powerplay asked for a solid rescue mission by Zalmi that never came as they kept losing wickets.
Faheem jolted Zalmi further with a double strike in the eighth over.
First, he induced Haris (17 off 16) to hole out to Rilee Rossouw at long-on and two balls later forced Abdul Samad (two) to get a very faint edge as Mendis took another catch to leave Zalmi tottering at 50-5.
After reaching 76-5 in 10 overs Zalmi needed a significant boost. Though Hussain Talat and Mitchel Owen (15 off eight) added 31 off 18 balls to give their team some hope but those were ended by fast bowler Khurram Shahzad with a double blow in the 11th.
Owen was caught nicely by Wasim at sweeper cover and when Khurram on his very next ball sent Alzarri Joseph, caught down the leg-side by Mendis, back to the pavilion, a big defeat started staring Zalmi in the face. They were now 81-7.
Luke Wood (eight) hit Fah­eem for a six  in the 12th over but the batter was und­one on the very next ball.
Hussian Talat, who made a 34-ball 39, was the ninth wicket to fall, as the left-hander was caught by Rossouw off spinner Abrar Ahmed in the 15th over.
Sufyan Muqeem became Faheem’s fifth victim in the next over when Ros­souw took his fourth catch of the innings.
Khurram took 2-9 in his three overs while Amir claimed 1-18 and Wasim 1-21 in three.
Earlier, captain Saud Shakeel and Finn Allen gave Gladiators a brisk start of 46 in 4.2 overs after Zalmi invited them to bat first before the latter misjudged a short ball outside off and was caught by Saim at point off Joseph. Allen made 31 off 16 with four fours and a couple of sixes.
Incoming Rossouw (27 off 18) kept the momentum going alongside Saud as the former cracked four fours in the sixth over bowled by pacer Ali Raza to help Gladiators end the powerplay at 67-1. Rossouw, was cleaned up by Saim in the 10th over as Gladiators were now 91-2. Gladiators reached 100 in 10.2 overs.
Saud’s innings (32 off 26, five fours) was ended by Saim in the 12th over as the southpaw played a slog sweep only to be caught by Samad just inside the mid-wicket boundary. The scoreboard now read 105-3.
Mendis smashed five boundaries in his 27-ball 32 before he was caught by Haris off Joseph.
Ali’s last over, 18th of the innings, produced 17 runs for Gladiators, who in the process reached 150 in 17.3 overs, as Mark Chapman (33) collected three fours.
Faheem (one) skied a short-pitched delivery from Joseph who himself took the catch. Hasan Nawaz (eight), after being hit by a Joseph bouncer, struck him for a six. He was eventually run out in the last over bowled by pacer Wood after a mix-up with Chap­man.
Wood dismissed Chap­man who, trying to play a big shot, was caught by Owen nicely at long-on as Gladiators lost their seventh wicket at 173.
Saim gave away only 24 runs for his two wickets while Joseph claimed three wickets for 33 in his four overs. Ali conceded 48 without a wicket while left-arm wrist spinner Sufiyan remained wicket-less for 33.

Senior PPP leaders Nasir Shah, Saeed Ghani, Waqar Mehdi, Sohail Siyal and others arrived at the temporary headquarters of the MQM-P in Bahadurabad.
During the meeting, both sides discussed political cooperation, urban development issues in Karachi and future coordination between the two parties.
The session was marked by an atmosphere of goodwill with leaders on both sides recognising the importance of continued dialogue.

Nasir Shah-led delegation visits MQM-P headquarters

Later, speaking to the media after the meeting, PPP’s Nasir Shah confirmed that the party leadership had sought support for Mr Mehdi for the Senate seat that fell vacant after the death of senior PPP leader Taj Haider.
“We are thankful to MQM for their cooperation, especially on the canal issue,” he said. “We are hopeful that MQM will support our candidate in the upcoming by-election.”
MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar emphasised the need for continued political engagement. “Politics is all about dialogue. PPP is our ally in the federal government, and we were also partners during the PDM-led government,” he said.
“There should be flexibility in our approach, and we must move discussions forward,” he said.
Dr Sattar also highlighted the need to revisit the past agreements between the PPP and the MQM.
He stressed the importance of continued informal dialogue on key issues such as water scarcity, constitutional amendments and the local government act. “Karachi’s issues require collective focus, and we must sit together regularly to find solutions,” he said.
He told reporters that the MQM-P filed nominations of Nighat Shakeel and Mujahid Baig for the Senate by-election. “We have received a formal request from the PPP. Our central committee, under the leadership of Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, will deliberate and finalise this matter,” he said.
To a question, Nasir Shah said: “If the decision regarding the six canals project on the Indus River is not reversed at the May 2 meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), the PPP will consider parting ways with the federal government.”
“We are not in the coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by choice, but out of necessity for the sake of Pakistan. The  canals issue is highly sensitive and that the party cannot back down on this matter,” he said.
He reiterated that PPP had always advocated for development and cooperation. He acknowledged the visible progress in development work.
He also thanked MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal for acknowledging that Karachi received federal funding during Asif Ali Zardari’s tenure. “This meeting is a gesture of goodwill and a step toward strengthening ties between our two parties,” he said.

• Metropolitan Police say at least one person held
• Tarar accuses New Delhi of sponsoring the attack
LONDON: As tensions between Pakistan and India rise in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistani diaspora protesters came face to face with their Indian counterparts outside the missions of both countries in central London, over the weekend.
The scenes outside the Pakistan High Commission in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, on Saturday and the Indian High Commission in Aldwych on Sunday showed that emotions are running high, with both sides chanting derogatory slogans and making offensive gestures against each other.
Met Police confirmed in a statement that officers were called at 5:03am on Sunday to reports of a man smashing windows at the Pakistani High Commission and that a 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of criminal damage and remains in custody. Eyewitnesses said eggs and saffron dye were also thrown at the embassy walls.
On Sunday, a handful of Pakistani protesters countered a sizeable number of Indian protesters, who were also joined by pro-Israel protesters who chanted anti-Pakistan slogans.
 
 

Outside the Pakistan mission, Pakistani protesters set up a chai stall in reference to the viral line by Indian pilot Abhinandan, who in 2019 was held captive by the Pakistan army when his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory and later repatriated. One gentleman stood on the balcony of the Pakistan mission and waved a cup of tea.
One eyewitness said that a pro-BJP group decided to initiate the anti-Pakistan protest outside the Pakistan mission, calling on scores of protesters. To counter the protest, PML-N’s UK chapter staged a counter-protest and used a sound system to drown out the anti-Pakistan slogans.
At both protests, Met Police officers stood forming a protective line between the two sides as anger and derogatory slogans were chanted. Indian protesters carried “I am Hindu” placards and waved empty water bottles, saying “do you want water”, referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Music was also blared by both sides, with the Pakistani protesters saying “Pak Fauj Zindabad” and “ISI Zindabad”. Anti-Modi and anti-Hindu slogans were also shouted, with Palestine flags and Pakistan flags waved together.
A pro-India protester was detained after making rude gestures and reportedly making racist comments. Indian protesters claimed that Met Police officers were being racist and that they pushed the protester “without listening”, adding that no one was arrested.
One Indian protester said the Met Police sides with Pakistan during the protests. Another said, “They have challenged Modi openly, now they will see the consequences.”
‘India responsible for attack’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar has accused India of being responsible for the attack on the Pakistan High Commission in London.
Speaking to reporters about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad, Mr Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London. Our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” the minister said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
Mr Tarar said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.

The FIR accused Ms Haider of attempting to “create anxiety in the society” and “weaken the state” through the spread of misinformation.
Ms Haider, while confirming the FIR, rejected the allegations levelled against her and said she has been facing harassment since 2018 for raising her voice for human rights.
According to Ms Haider, she criticised the arrest of Dr Baloch and pointed out her organisation — BYC — has not been banned.

“The car was blown up and badly damaged in the powerful blast, causing panic among the people of Pasni town,” a senior police officer said, adding that soon after the blast the personnel of law enforcement agencies rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to the district hospital.
 
 

The deceased were identified as Nawab Salman, a resident of Pasni, and Muhammad Nawaz, a resident of Khushab district of Punjab.
Also, some armed men hurled hand grenades at the Police Lines area of Dhahar in Kacchi district and at a livestock office in Sibi. However, no loss of life was reported in the grenade attacks.

The arrests were carried out across  multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian, and Kulgam, according to the Kashmir Media Service.
In the Islamabad district of held-Kashmir alone, cordon-and-search operations and house raids resulted in the arrest of over 175 people. The detainees have been transferred to police stations and army camps.
A police spokesperson said that 175 individuals had been detained during house raids and search operations across various areas of the district, adding that additional checkpoints had been set up and patrolling had been intensified, particularly in densely forested regions.

More than 2,000 people picked up, shifted to police stations, army camps

Following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian troops and paramilitary forces escalated operations across the valley, carrying out widespread house raids and arbitrary arrests.
 
 

Indian forces have also launched a campaign of demolishing the homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris. Since Saturday, the ancestral homes of seven  Kashmiris have been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces, the Kashmir Media Service reported.
On the other hand, the houses of five more Kashmiris were demolished in what critics described as ‘collective punishment’.
The demolished houses belonged to the families of Amir Nazeer Wani, Jameel Ahmad Sher Gojri, Adnan Safi Dar, Amir Ahmed and Farooq Ahmad Tedwa. High-intensity explosives caused extensive damage to surrounding homes, leaving dozens of families homeless and in distress.
Critics accuse Indian authorities of mimicking Israeli tactics of occupation and dispossession to render Kashmiris homeless and break their resistance to Indian rule.
Abdul Rashid Minhas, a spokesman for the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), condemned the demolitions and arrests in a statement issued in Srinagar.

• Kh Asif calls for int’l probe
• No official word on Nawaz-Shehbaz huddle
ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership continued to engage with foreign capitals over the weekend to highlight India’s attempts to cloak its provocative actions and false accusations in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
In separate calls with leaders from China, UK and Iran, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar drew attention to the “baseless propaganda and unilateral measures” taken by New Delhi, including the decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which is a clear violation of the country’s international obligations.
Mr Dar, who also hold the foreign affairs portfolio, spoke to his counterparts from the UK and China and stressed Islamabad’s unwavering resolve to defend its national interests, while continuing to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Mr Dar that Beijing was paying close attention to the evolving situation between Pakistan and India.
He reaffirmed China’s consistent support for Pakistan’s firm counterterrorism efforts.
 
 

“As an ironclad friend and an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
“China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,” Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s Central committee, hoped that both sides would remain restrained, move toward each other, and work together to de-escalate the situation.
In a separate call with the UK foreign secretary, Mr Dar briefed David Lammy on “India’s false accusations, baseless propaganda, and unilateral measures”, while reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to a Foreign Office readout of the call, the UK foreign secretary emphasised the imp­o­rtance of de-escalating the situation thro­ugh dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues.
Appreciating these efforts, Mr Dar conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to participate in any independent and transparent investigation to ascertain the facts.
Both leaders agreed to maintain active contact regarding the evolving situation.
Call for int’l commission
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khaw­aja Asif called on India to stop levelling baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, he said the UN Security Council and key regional powers should investigate the Pahalgam incident, warning that if two nuclear powers collided, world peace would also be destroyed.
Calling for the formation of an international commission to investigate the incident, he said that the UN should consider including China, Russia, Iran and Arab countries in the body. Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.
He accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.
Call with Iranian president
Speaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.
During their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.
Referring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.
The PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.
 
 

Pakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.
Separately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.
However, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.

• Condition applies to both contract, regular re-employment after age 60
• Move aims to curb rising pension costs under IMF requirements
• Govt pension bill estimated at over Rs1tr in current fiscal year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has formally notified that retired public servants rejoining government service, whether on a contract or regular basis, will now have to choose between drawing a salary or receiving their pension and may no longer claim both simultaneously.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” said a notification issued by the regulation wing of the Ministry of Finance.
Earlier, rehired government employees used to avail of the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously — and in some cases, multiple pensions. This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
The latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.
 
 

The measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.
In September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.
According to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.
The scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.
The federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.
On the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.
Subsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.
It had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.
This was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.
However, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.

• Ports anticipate crisis; manufacturers face raw material shortages
• President wades in to resolve situation
KARACHI: Efforts to disperse protesters, who have paralysed cross-country traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh, remained futile on Sunday, with manufacturers saying they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The road closures in several parts of Sindh are due to continuing protests against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the River Indus.
Although the federal government and the PPP regime in Sindh have agreed to postpone the project, nationalist parties, lawyers and other civil society groups do not appear convinced by the assurance and have vowed to continue their protests until the government makes the postponement official.
According to Dawn’s correspondent in Sukkur, thousands of heavy vehicles are stuck in long queues on different roads in the Kandhkot, Kashmore, Ghotki, Sukkur and Khairpur areas.
Manufacturers and transporters are surprised by the persisting impasse, even though the provincial government has been calling on protesters to clear the roads.
 
 

On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, where the issue of the controversial projects and its fallout also came under discussion.
Sources privy to the meeting said the chief minister expressed concern over attempts by some political parties to exploit the issue for what he termed “vested interests”, referring to the ongoing protesters, staged mainly by nationalist parties in different parts of the province.
The CM also briefed the president about measures the Sindh government was taking to address public concerns and restore normalcy in affected areas, sources said.
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House at 4pm today (Monday).
Transport at a standstill
An official at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) told Dawn that export cargo was not arriving, while imported cargo was piling up and not moving out of the port due to the closure of roads in Sindh.
“We are managing this situation to avoid congestion at the port, especially with the continuous arrival of imported goods . But in case goods movement remains held up, the port will face severe congestion, the official said.
Transporters say that in addition to worrying manufacturers and exporters, their drivers and helpers are also in a dire situation. Nisar Jafry of the All Pakistan Goods Transporters Associa­tion said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded.
He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be their meant for import, export or locally produced.
Giving an estimated headcount, he said that around 90,000-100,000 drivers and their helpers have been stranded alongside their vehicles on the highways for over 10 days now. They are also facing food and water shortages.
 
 

Transporters also alleged that protesters had damaged dozens of vehicles parked on the roads, and that over 100 sacrificial animals that were part of their cargo had already died.
Mr Jafry said he had received a call from Sindh transport minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, requesting him to call off Monday’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Memon called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Due to the closures, the public, livestock, import and export sectors, farmers, and the poor are being severely affected, he said, adding that if the sit-ins must continue, the roads should be opened so that the flow of traffic is not hampered.
Representatives of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oil Companies Advisory Council and the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council have all warned that the disruptions to the logistics supply chain are creating a severe crisis.
Although around 800-1,000 oil trucks are also stranded, the OCAC representative ruled out the possibility of a fuel shortage just yet.
