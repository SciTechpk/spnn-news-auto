<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24195713c56288c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968802/trump-threatens-canada-with-100pc-tariff-over-possible-deal-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens Canada with 100pc tariff over possible deal with China</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would impose a 100 per cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China and warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that a deal would endanger his country.
“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.







“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100pc Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA.”
Carney during a recent visit to China called the Asian superpower a “reliable and predictable partner” and in Davos encouraged European leaders to seek investment from the world’s second-largest economy.
Trump suggested that China would try to use Canada to evade US tariffs.
“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”
Tensions between the U.S. and its northern neighbour have grown in recent days.
Trump on Thursday withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.
That about-face followed Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.</p><small>2026-01-24 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24180215b11b084.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968799/at-least-3-killed-in-fire-at-hotel-in-lahores-gulberg' target='_blank'><strong>At least 3 killed in fire at hotel in Lahore’s Gulberg</strong></a><br><p>At least three people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Lahore’s Gulberg, according to rescue officials.
Punjab Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said at least three people had been killed in the fire at the Indigo Hotel.
He said the victims were identified as Shehreyar, approximately 25-years-old, Imran, approximately 30-years-old, and Riaz, approximately 30-years-old.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif also shared several updates about the incident on the social media platform X.
She said the fire occurred in the basement of the hotel. She said 280 people, including 180 guests and 100 staff members, had been rescued.







Earlier, she said she was monitoring the evacuation and rescue operation through the Safe City drone system.







She had also said the incident was caused by the “explosion of the air-conditioning system boiler”, terming it “severe”.
“Strict directives have been issued: All commercial boiler and cylinder installations across Punjab must fully comply with safety standards. Any premises found compromising public safety will be sealed immediately, without exception,” she said.







The development comes as Karachi is reeling from a deadly fire at a popular shopping mall, which has claimed 71 lives so far.
On Thursday, the Punjab government gave two weeks to stakeholders to implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) in plazas, schools and hospitals in the wake of Gul Plaza inferno.
“A building grading system has now been introduced across the province, under which safe buildings will be categorised as A-grade, while others will be graded according to their condition. The firefighting sector is being upgraded with modern technology, drones and state-of-the-art equipment,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference in Lahore.</p><small>2026-01-24 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24193155f82ec67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968800/snow-heavy-rain-kill-61-in-three-days-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Snow, heavy rain kill 61 in three days in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Snow and heavy rain have killed 61 people in Afghanistan in the past three days, disaster officials said on Saturday, with a major road and power also cut in several provinces.
The deaths occurred mainly in central and northern provinces between Wednesday and Friday, according to a map released by Afghanistan’s disaster management authority (ANDMA).
The “initial figures of casualties and destruction” also include 110 injured people and 458 houses that were either partially or fully destroyed, ANDMA said on social media platform X.







A total of 360 families were affected, said a spokesman who asked people in a video message to avoid unnecessary travel on snowy roads.
The spokesman also told AFP that most of the casualties were caused by roof collapses and avalanches, while many also died from frostbite in sub-zero temperatures.
The emergency department in the southern province of Kandahar said six children were killed when the roof of their home collapsed in strong wind and heavy rain on Wednesday.
Houses were also damaged in other districts.
Major highway cut
The Salang highway, one of Afghanistan’s main roads, has been closed, authorities in Parwan province north of Kabul said. The highway is a vital connection to Afghanistan’s northern provinces.
Food supplies were also distributed to travellers stuck on a mountain pass in central Bamyan province, west of the capital.
A transmission line importing electricity from Uzbekistan was also damaged on Thursday, leaving households in almost 12 provinces without power.
“The technical teams are ready but cannot reach the area because of the blockage of Salang pass,” said Mohammad Sadiq, the spokesman for Afghanistan’s national power utility DABS.
The heavy snow and rain also destroyed shops and killed livestock in different parts of the predominantly rural country.
“Snow and rain, when managed properly, contribute positively to Afghanistan’s environment and livelihoods,” the Kabul Times daily wrote in an editorial.
“However, without sufficient preparation and timely intervention, these natural phenomena can quickly turn into sources of tragedy,” it said.
Around half of Afghanistan’s population of more than 40 million people will need humanitarian assistance this year, according to the United Nations, after a sharp drop in foreign assistance in recent years.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes and drought also often compound the daily struggle to survive.</p><small>2026-01-24 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241811228a2a4f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968798/legal-system-in-pakistan-is-dead-condemnations-pour-in-after-imaan-hadi-sentenced-in-social-media-posts-case' target='_blank'><strong>‘Legal system in Pakistan is dead’: Condemnations pour in after Imaan, Hadi sentenced in social media posts case</strong></a><br><p>A sessions court on Saturday sentenced lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her spouse, Hadi Ali Chattha, to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case about controversial social media posts, a day after they were arrested in Islamabad.
According to the written order, Imaan “consistently disseminated highly offensive, misleading and anti-state contents on social media”, with the “active connivance” of Hadi.
The order also observed that Imaan’s tweets made between 2021 and 2025 from “portrayed the agenda” of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Lawyers, activists and politicians expressed their outrage over the sentencing. Here are some of the reactions.
‘Completely illegal’
Digital rights expert and activist Usama Khilji said, “Completely illegal, unconstitutional and baseless order without any roots in due process, especially as the transfer application is pending in the high court.”
He said that the sentencing of human rights lawyers for “tweets rights violations makes Pakistan a laughing stock”.







‘Judge has no jurisdiction’
Lawyer Jibran Nasir stated that Judge Afzal Majoka “has no jurisdiction” to convict Imaan and Hadi, as he was barred from doing so because of an application to transfer the couple’s case from his court.
“We filed this transfer application on behalf of Imaan and Hadi on December 5, 2025, seeking transfer of the trial from the court of Afzal Majoka. The application is yet to be heard and decided,” he wrote.
“It does not matter what the findings of the judge are. It does not matter what the merits or demerits of the evidence are. Nothing matters,” he added.
“This act of Judge Afzal Majoka is coram non judice. It is not a judicial order, it is a nullity, not even worth the paper it is written on.”
Nasir added that the trial “proved to be a sham” and irreparably prejudiced the couple’s right to a fair trial. He argued that, thus, it should be considered vitiated”.
“Whether the judge acted out of contempt, incompetence or under duress, the express and mandatory command of law was ignored,” he wrote.
“No high court or Supreme Court can defend this even after the 27th Amendment. Imaan and Hadi have again won in exposing the regime,” he said.







‘Blot on democracy and justice’
The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) condemned the “harsh” sentences following “unfair and non-independent trials”.
“This decision is contrary to the fundamental principles of judicial independence and is a manifestation of a fearful, pressured judicial environment, where political objectives have been prioritised over justice,” the statement, posted on X, read.
The TTAP branded the sentences a “terrifying reflection of the controlled judicial structure” which emerged after the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments.
The amendments “effectively stripped the judiciary of its constitutional independence, subjecting it to administrative and political pressure, as a result of which decisions are emerging that do not meet the demands of justice but rather reflect the will of the centres of power”, the statement added.
Declaring the court’s decision “a blot on democracy and justice”, the TTAP demanded Imaan and Hadi’s immediate release.







‘Apalling judgment’
Lawyer Reema Omar said the judgment against Imaan and Hadi was “apalling” and “should be of concern for anyone who believes in dissent and the freedom of expression”.







‘Legal system in Pakistan is dead’
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan noted that the “kangaroo court” conviction of Imaan and Hadi proved that “the legal system in Pakistan is dead”.
“Members of the judiciary, from the highest to the lowest foru,m should hang their heads in shame,” he said.
“The judiciary is a willing accessory and accomplice with the illegal imposed fascist regime ruling Pakistan,” he said.







‘Law and basic decency decimated’
Activist Ammar Ali Jan said that the couple were the latest victims of “state gangsterism” and that their “only crime is that they consistently spoke up for victims of enforced disappearances and false blasphemy accusations”.
“This regime has decimated law and basic decency. Everyone’s turn will come if we don’t speak up,” he said.







‘We have made ourselves far poorer’
Journalist Benazir Shah noted that Imaan and Hadi defended those accused of blasphemy and the families of missing persons, whom she deemed “the most vulnerable and silenced people in the country”.
“By punishing Imaan and Hadi, we have made ourselves far poorer — morally and legally,” she wrote.







‘Clear message for others who rise to challenge and question the state’
Veteran journalist Mariana Baabar posted a copy of the court order on X, listing the years of imprisonment handed to the couple.
“[This is a] clear message for others who rise to challenge and question the state,” she wrote.







‘Judge will be remembered in history’
Journalist Azaz Syed noted that Judge Majoka will be remembered in history for “delivering justice to the state at remarkable speed”, adding that he “set a new record”.
“Reportedly, [the] judge neither allowed them the right of cross-examination nor permitted them to give their final statements, known in court as the Section 342 statement,” he said.







‘Grave miscarriage of justice’
Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called the verdict “a grave miscarriage of justice”.
“These human rights lawyers were convicted under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act solely for social media posts criticising what they saw as state abuses and advocating for marginalised communities,” he said.
“The unfair sentences, procedural irregularities, and apparent motivations behind the case reveal a weaponisation of the law to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend vulnerable groups,” he said.
“This ruling sends a chilling message that peaceful advocacy and criticism of power will be met with severe repression. Genuine accountability for human rights violations should be pursued instead of punishing those who expose them,” he said, expressing the hope that the higher judiciary would grant the lawyers relief.

Bangladesh had announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
Subsequently, the ICC rejected the country’s request to shift its games. However, Bangladesh insisted it would not travel to India for the tournament.
In the statement posted on its website on Saturday, the ICC stated that the decision was made in the absence of “any credible or verifiable security threat” to the Bangladesh national team in India.
“Scotland has been called up to take Bangladesh’s place in Group C, joining England, Italy, Nepal and the West Indies,” the ICC announced.
The ICC noted that Scotland, ranked the 14th-highest T20 team in the world, was selected since they were the next-highest ranked team after Bangladesh.
The statement read that the governing body rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to move their matches from India to Sri Lanka, who are co-hosts of the tournament.
“Independent security assessments were conducted from internal and external experts,” the statement read.
“The [ICC] Board made the difficult decision that it was not feasible to meet the BCB’s requests so close to the tournament,” the ICC stated.
“The decision follows an extensive process undertaken by the ICC to address concerns raised by the BCB regarding the hosting of its scheduled matches in India,” it said.
Engagement between the ICC and the BCB took place over more than three weeks, the statement outlined, adding that multiple rounds of dialogue were conducted “in a transparent and constructive manner” with meetings held both via video link and in person.
“As part of this process, the ICC reviewed the concerns cited by the BCB, commissioned and considered independent security assessments from internal and external experts, and shared detailed security and operational plans covering federal and state arrangements, as well as enhanced and escalating security protocols for the event,” the statement added.
“These assurances were reiterated at several stages, including during discussions involving the ICC Business Corporation (IBC) Board. The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India,” it stated.
Based on the findings, cricket’s governing body determined that it was “not appropriate” to amend or change the tournament’s schedule.
Furthermore, the statement added that following a meeting on Wednesday, the BCB was granted 24 hours to confirm its participation in India as scheduled.
“As no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC proceeded in line with its established governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement team,” it added.
Naqvi rues unfair treatment of Bangladesh
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.
Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, made the remarks while speaking to the media in Lahore.
In his media talk, Naqvi said that the PCB’s stance on the situation would be according to the government of Pakistan’s instructions.







“Bangladesh has been treated unfairly. I said the same in the board meeting of the ICC. You cannot have double standards, where one country can make whatever decision whenever and do the total opposite for another country.
“That is why we have taken the stand that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly and should be allowed to play the World Cup in any case. They are a major stakeholder and this injustice should not be done.”
Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, he said the government of Pakistan would make the decision. “We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.
He was also asked whether he would suggest to the ICC a hybrid model for Bangladesh, similar to the one between Pakistan and India.
“The thing is that Bangladesh is the same member as Pakistan. And our stance is that if you have done this favour with Pakistan and India, then you should do the same with Bangladesh,” he said.
“The main reason for this is that one country cannot dictate another. And if this dictation is attempted, then Pakistan definitely has its own stance,” he said.
Asked whether there was a “Plan B” for a scenario in which Pakistan would also not play the T20 World Cup, he quipped, “Let the decision come first; we have Plan A, B, C, D.”</p><small>2026-01-24 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241054475061710.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968777/outcome-of-negligence-and-carelessness-karachi-police-register-fir-of-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>‘Outcome of negligence and carelessness’: Karachi police register FIR of Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>Police on Saturday registered a first information report (FIR) over the devastating Gul Plaza inferno, citing the incident as an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed. It has so far claimed 71 lives.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the FIR had been registered on behalf of the state, through a police official, under relevant laws.
According to the FIR, Nabi Bux Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Nawaz Ali Zardari said the police received information about the fire in the plaza at around 10:30pm on January 17.
The FIR added that the fire was “rapidly spreading and engulfed the entire plaza” while firefighters and other rescue personnel were engaged in efforts to extinguish the blaze.
It further stated that the fire erupted in shop number 193, a flower and gift shop, located on the ground floor, and quickly spread in the shopping plaza.
“Rescue work is ongoing and there are apprehensions of more deaths,” said the FIR.
The police also blamed the lack of firefighting equipment and “no reasonable arrangements” in the case of an emergency for the tragedy.
The report added that there were “no emergency exits” and that electricity had been switched off, complicating the evacuation of those inside the shopping plaza.
“Due to these reasons, precious human lives were lost and substantive financial losses also occurred.”
The FIR has been registered under Sections 322 (murder without intention), 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
Police have not nominated anyone in the case; therefore, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons.



Sindh home minister says tragedies should not be politicised
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that tragedies such as the Gul Plaza fire should not be turned into political controversies, according to a statement from his office.
Speaking to the media at the Police Training College in Shahdadpur, Lanjar expressed deep sorrow over the Gul Plaza tragedy, stating that precious human lives had been lost and the entire provincial government was in mourning.
According to the statement, he added that an FIR had been registered in connection with the incident, including sections related to negligence and carelessness, and assured that action would be taken against those responsible in accordance with the law.
“Tragedies such as the Gul Plaza incident should not be turned into political controversies,” he was quoted as saying, regretting that the matter was being linked to the 18th Constitutional Amendment and the NFC Award, which he described as “beyond understanding”.







Criticising leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), he added, “Politics over dead bodies are unacceptable under any circumstances. Such incidents could occur in Lahore, Peshawar, or any other city.”
The home department stated that Lanjar clarified that Gul Plaza’s lease had been granted in the past and that the Sindh chief minister had already placed all facts of the tragedy before the nation.
He was further quoted as saying that the chief minister had announced financial assistance for the families of the deceased, and affected traders would also be provided with rebuilt shops.
Need to learn lessons: Khaqan Abbasi
Awaam Pakistan Convenor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a visit to Gul Plaza, where he stressed the need to “learn lessons” from the incident and take corrective measures.
“This has been a complete failure […] There are thousands of such buildings in Karachi. What will the government do about those?” he said while speaking to the media.
The ex-premier remarked that possibly replacing a “few officials” after an investigation was “no compensation” for the loss of lives and property caused by the fire.
During the media talk, a citizen decried that the relatives of the deceased who had come for shopping were “not getting any information” or propoer responses.
“We had given our DNA report from the first day [of the incident], but we have got nothing so far.”
Responding to him and another query, Abbasi said, “Whenever such incidents take place, the government institutions come and analyse how many people have been martyred and how their relatives can be helped.
“[…] It takes some time but it appears that such a procedure has not been employed […] how they can be consoled, helped in the identification.”
Addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club later, the Awaam Pakistan chief stressed that it was the responsibility of the government to “at least listen” to the affected people.



CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures
On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance.
Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution.
About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people.
The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation.
“This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted.
The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year.
“My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said.
He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans.
The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years.
The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed.
He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.</p><small>2026-01-24 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24171631cff4bcf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968788/day-after-dramatic-arrest-imaan-and-hadi-handed-jail-sentence-in-controversial-social-media-posts-case' target='_blank'><strong>Day after dramatic arrest, Imaan and Hadi handed jail sentence in controversial social media posts case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A sessions court on Saturday sentenced lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her spouse Hadi Ali Chattha to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to social media posts.
The lawyer couple were already on judicial remand at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail after they were arrested in Islamabad in connection with a separate case on Friday.
The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka stated that the “prosecution has been able to prove its case against both the accused” under sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), 26-A (false and fake information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
Hence, under Peca’s Section 9, Imaan and Hadi were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years each with a fine of Rs5 million each. If they failed to pay, the two will have to spend one more year of jail.
Under Section 10 of Peca, they were each handed 10 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs30m each, with an additional two years for each for failure to pay.
Lastly, the couple were sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment each under Section 26-A of Peca with a fine of Rs1m each. The failure to pay the fine will result in being jailed six months each.
The sentences will run concurrently.
The order noted that the convicts were “present in custody in some other case on video link”, adding that they be kept in jail to undergo their sentences.
The court gave both the benefit of Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which allows the period of detention to be considered as part of the sentence.
In his judgment, Judge Majoka recalled Sub-inspector Sharooz Riaz’s August 2025 complaint that Imaan “consistently disseminated highly offensive, misleading and anti-state contents on social media”, with the “active connivance” of Hadi.
“She propagated a narrative that aligned with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations and individuals. Her contents incited ethnic hatred, undermined public trust on state organisations and portrayed the armed forces are behind terrorism and forced disappearances.”
The order observed that Imaan’s tweets made between 2021 and 2025 from “portrayed the agenda” of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka stated: “Both the accused persons are advocates by profession and they have fully knowledge that the [sic] Pakistan is not included in the list of terrorist states but they have intentionally in their tweets mentioned the [sic] Pakistan as a terrorist state, which in fact is the agenda of BLA, TTP.”
“Both the accused persons portrayed the armed forces as being responsible for the act of terrorism in the country and alleged that the state and its institutions are working in collusion with the proscribed individuals and organisations,” the judgment read.
“I found both the accused persons have been fully involved in the commission of an offence punishable under sections 9,10,11/26-A Peca, 2016,” Judge Majoka observed.
The order further noted, “During the course of inquiry, it came to light that accused persons are involved in the propagation and dissemination of narratives aligned with the proscribed individuals/organisations.
“The content, including tweets, re-tweets, shared and uploaded by the accused persons, expressed solidarity and support for the proscribed organisations (BLA, TTP and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement) and proscribed individuals (Mahrang Baloch, Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pashteen).”

 

The judgment referred to five prosecution witnesses produced before the court, including National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) Reporting Centre Assistant Director Imran Haider and Riaz.
While mentioning X posts made by Imaan in favour of Mahrang or the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), the order noted that several of them had been reposted by Hadi.
The court did “not agree” with the arguments of the defence counsel that the mere view of the accused about any proscribed individual was not enough to determine them guilty of committing an offence under Section 9 of Peca.
The judge stressed that glorification has been defined in Peca as including “any form of praise or celebration” of proscribed organisations or individuals or groups.
“The said tweets of the accused persons damaged public trust in state institutions, especially law-enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and blamed the state for terrorism and enforced disappearances,” the order stated.
“The matter does not rest here. Imaan Zainab Mazari accused claimed that the state runs torture cells and that dehumanisation, alienation and uncalled for crackdown/violence are the state-standard response to peaceful Baloch voice,” it further highlighted, declaring her as guilty under Section 10 of Peca.
Regarding the charge for spreading false information, the order noted: “There was no proof with the accused that the state has forcibly disappeared any person but despite that, in number of tweets they claimed that the state is responsible for it.”
Earlier on Saturday, the couple briefly appeared via video link before Majoka’s court in Islamabad. However, court proceedings were disrupted when the couple boycotted the hearing, following which the court reserved its order.
Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday prompted criticism by rights bodies, politicians, and journalists, who stressed the couple’s right to a fair trial.
Amnesty International noted the “lack of adherence to due process” and said these were “retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Imaan and Hadi for their human rights work and dissent”.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also condemned the arrests, terming the case a “tool to harass, intimidate and ultimately muzzle dissent”.







‘Totally illegal’
Imaan’s mother Shireen Mazari, a former human rights minister, reacted to the sentencing by terming it “totally illegal”.
“Their [transfer application] is still pending in [Islamabad High Court] so legally judge cannot pass judgment till [transfer application] is heard,” Mazari contended.







In another post, she said: “They got their pound of flesh [through] an order passed illegally but the emasculated men don’t give a damn. It was always about ‘off with their heads’.”







On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar hailed the verdict, quipping on X: “As you sow, so shall you reap!
“The first official and final result of Peca. One should fear God,” he added.







Today’s hearing
At the start of the hearing on Saturday, the court sought compliance with earlier directions regarding the production of the accused for cross-examination, which the court had declared as the final opportunity in light of orders issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Citing security concerns, police submitted a report stating that it would take five to six hours to transport the accused from jail and requested permission for them to appear through a video link. The court accepted the request and directed that Imaan and Hadi be presented via video link.
However, technical issues, including internet connectivity problems at Adiala jail, delayed the proceedings. After a brief adjournment, Imaan and Hadi finally appeared before the court via video link.

 

When the judge asked whether the defence wished to begin cross-examination, Imaan questioned whether media representatives were present in the courtroom.
She then alleged that both she and her husband were being subjected to mistreatment in custody, adding that they were not being provided food or water.
Imaan addressed the judge directly, saying, “You are doing your job … everything is happening because of you.”
The incarcerated lawyer then announced that both she and her husband were boycotting the proceedings.
In response, Judge Majoka asked whether they no longer wished to participate in the trial and advised them to wait for the verdict. Despite this, both the accused left their seats before the conclusion of the hearing, effectively refusing to take part in further proceedings.
Following the boycott, the judge directed the court staff to record the entire proceedings and place them on the judicial record.
Defence counsel Ashraf Gujjar later moved a request for summoning a person relevant to the case. The judge noted that the individual had already appeared online and stated that the entire record would be reviewed.
Subsequently, Judge Majoka announced that he would pass a written order on the defence request and reserved the decision, while the trial remained pending.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the BLA and TTP.
Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.

 

Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
Separately, earlier this week, a case related to a protest by the BYC and dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Friday, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.</p><small>2026-01-24 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24171047bfed526.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968794/pakistan-us-to-take-joint-action-against-fraudulent-visa-networks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US to take joint action against fraudulent visa networks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the United States on Saturday decided to take joint action against fraudulent visa networks under comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The decision came during a meeting between US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. According to a handout by the interior ministry, a detailed discussion was held on Pakistan–US relations and increasing cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
Talks were also held on preventing illegal immigration and the effectiveness of the pre-immigration clearance system, the statement said.
It added that an agreement was reached on increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies, with a particular focus on police training.
“The meeting decided that joint action will be taken against false and fraudulent visa networks under comprehensive SOPs,” the handout stated.
Naqvi was quoted as saying that a zero-tolerance policy had been adopted against the “agent mafia” and welcomed cooperation with Washington in this sector.
“I am personally supervising action against fraudulent visa networks,” he stated. He said security features had been added to passports using modern technology, making the travel document “foolproof”.
The interior minister noted that illegal immigration had become a serious issue and acknowledged Washington’s full-scale crackdown against those who enter the US illegally.
“Due to the government’s effective measures, there has been a 47 per cent drop in illegal immigration,” Naqvi said.
There will be no leniency for the elements involved in fraudulent documentation networks, he said.
Meanwhile, Baker was quoted as saying that the US attached “special importance” its relationship with Pakistan.
“Our priorities are aligned and promoting mutual cooperation will further strengthen relations,” she was quoted as saying.</p><small>2026-01-24 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241629448e2ef63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968790/iran-fm-thanks-pakistan-for-strong-support-at-un-human-rights-council' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM thanks Pakistan for ‘strong support’ at UN Human Rights Council</strong></a><br><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar for his “strong support” and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) amid the prevailing tense situation between Washington and Tehran.
On Friday, the UNHRC adopted a resolution — with 25 votes in favour, seven against and 14 abstentions — to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years.
The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran by one year and called for an urgent investigation by the mission, in the context of the deadly nationwide protests in Iran that started in December.
Pakistan, along with China and India, voted against the resolution.
In a post on X on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Dar, who is on a visit to Dubai, received a telephone call from Araghchi.
The Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”, the FO added.







The ministry said the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people.
Separately, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also thanked the country’s leadership for its “historic and unwavering support” at the UNHRC by “calling for a vote and casting a negative vote against the unjustified resolution targeting Iran”.
In his post on X, Moghadam also conveyed special appreciation to the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Pakistan in Geneva for “their tireless efforts and dedication” in the pursuit of justice.







“This principled stance marks the third consecutive defeat of unprovoked and politically motivated actions against Iran over the past year, including the unprovoked twelve-day aggression, recent foreign-backed riots aimed at destabilising the country, and the misuse of international organisations to pursue capricious and hostile agendas by certain members.”
The envoy went on saying that such “steadfast support” was a clear reflection of the country’s “enduring commitment to justice, multilateralism, respect for human rights, and national sovereignty”, adding that it would be “remembered with deep appreciation”.
On Friday, a senior Iranian official said the country would treat any attack “as an all-out war against us”, after US President Donald Trump’s comment that a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely.</p><small>2026-01-24 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24121443c079561.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968776/mqm-p-urges-pm-shehbaz-to-form-high-level-inquiry-commission-to-probe-negligence-in-gul-plaza-incident' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P urges PM Shehbaz to form high-level inquiry commission to probe ‘negligence’ in Gul Plaza incident</strong></a><br><p>The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Saturday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to constitute a high-level inquiry commission to hold those accountable whose negligence led to the Gul Plaza inferno.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 71 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said the citizens of Karachi had “questions of a very serious nature regarding the responsibilities of the Sindh government in this incident”, as well as those of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the mayor.
He called for an “independent judicial inquiry” into the Gul Plaza tragedy to ensure the truth comes to light. Sattar questioned what the “fear and obstruction” was in setting up a judicial commission.
“Incapability, mistake, apathy, shamelessness, impudence — these should be exposed,” Sattar demanded.
Sattar further demanded that the top officials of various departments be included in the commission, echoing a letter written by MQM-P Convener Khalid Maqbool to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday.



In a letter dated January 23, Maqbool Siddiqui called on the premier to notify a “high-powered independent, transparent, and impartial commission of inquiry” under Section 3 of the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act 2017 (PCIA).
The MQM-P leader called on the premier to take “serious notice in exercise [of] your constitutional powers” for providing justice to the Gul Plaza victims.
The commission would aim to “inquire comprehensively into the said incident and to fix the [responsibility] and to bring to justice […] all those Sindh Govt. officials and other culprits, private persons, etc, who have been found to be involved in the happening and the subsequent deaths and loss of valuable lives of hundreds of victims, injured etc, either directly or indirectly in any manner, specially due to criminal professional negligence of Sindh Govt. officials”, the letter added.
It further urged the premier to make the inquiry commission’s report public under Section 15 of the PCIA to “ensure transparency and accountability, such that no said tragic, traumatic and inhuman incident” will take place in the future.
“It is also requested on behalf of the victims and injured affectees and their families of the said incident that federal government may immediately take into custody all the incident area into its custody and thereby direct federal departments and armed forces help to search and rescue operation the remains and scattered body parts and valuable of the victims such that the same may be securely preserved and thereby properly delivered after identification to their relevant heirs and families,” the letter added.
Siddiqui also requested that “necessary actions for immediate rehabilitation and financial assistance of the victims and injured persons’ immediate families and dependents” be taken, including the establishment of a “relief and rehabilitation fund” at the federal level to minimise the affected people’s economic hardships.
He suggested that the commission include the director generals (DGs) of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Sindh National Accountability Bureau (NAB); the directors of Military Intelligence (MI) and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI); the State Bank of Pakistan joint director; as well as members from Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Council of Architects and Town Planners, and National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak).
The MQM-P convener, who is also the federal education minister, highlighted the alleged “severity, intensity, and the scale of criminal professional negligence, mismanagement, professional misconduct by the [Government] of Sindh and its allied [government] machinery” during the incident.
He contended that “economically approx. 12,000 plus families have been directly affected, whereas thousands have been indirectly affected, prima facie due to gross criminal professional negligence, mismanagement, professional misconduct, rampant cancer of corruption, of the Sindh Govt. and its relevant officials, as per their respective domains”.
Those officials “primarily” included the local government secretary; the Karachi mayor; the deputy mayor; KMC and its Fire and Rescue Department; the Karachi municipal commissioner; the Karachi commissioner; the Sindh Building Control Authority (SCBA) DG, director (South), deputy director (South) and building inspectors; the district administration; and the Civil Defence Organisation.
The letter contended that lives could have been “saved if timely and effective, organised rescue and recovery actions had been taken on the said day”.
“However, unfortunately it reportedly took approximately 03 days to control the fire in the said incident, leading to hundreds of tragic deaths on record whereas, dozens of missing perons whose remains have been reportedly lying there at the incident area in the forms of thousands of bones and scattered body parts showing how the tragic and catastrophic deaths were happened there solely due to failure of Govt. of Sindh and its [government] machinery,” it alleged.
Claiming that the Sindh government was not “cooperating” with the victims’ families, the MQM-P leader called for the federal government’s “intervention on war-footing basis as per constitutional mandate before it’s too late”.
Siddiqui asked PM Shehbaz to take the said actions for the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 10A (right to fair trial), 14 (inviolability of dignity of man), 18 (freedom of trade, business or profession), 24 (protection of property rights) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
Farooq Sattar responds to CM Murad
He contended that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was “misleading the people” and diverting attention away from the Gul Plaza incident, mentioning his remarks on the floor of the Sindh Assembly.
On Friday, while detailing the history of Gul Plaza’s construction, CM Murad had pointed out that Sattar had approved the regularisation of building violations as the mayor in 2003.
In response, Sattar argued that regularisations were also done by his successor, Naimatullah Khan and that the PPP had been in power in Sindh since 2008.

 

Sattar also lashed out at the chief minister for reaching the site “22 hours” after the incident occurred, adding that Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab visited “after 23 hours”.
He criticised the Sindh government for terming the questions raised by them as “politicising” the matter. “Should someone not ask where the mayor was, when he did not arrive until 23 hours later? Should someone not ask why the deputy mayor did not come at all?”
Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad had paid a visit to the site by the afternoon of January 18.
“Make no mistake, chief minister Sindh. Make no mistake, mayor Karachi. The time is coming; the noose of accountability on your neck is tightening. The people of Karachi would not let you escape so easily,” he said.
“You can fool some people sometimes. You can fool some people all the time. You can fool all the people sometimes. But you can’t fool all the people all the time. Enough is enough.” Sattar quipped.</p><small>2026-01-24 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241538473843fa1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968787/imaan-hadi-arrest-and-a-state-at-war-with-dissent' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan-Hadi arrest and a state at war with dissent</strong></a><br><p>
“As dissenters challenge existing ideas, social consciousness grows, the condition of human existence and rights improve and society progresses …Thus, it is in society’s collective interest that the right to dissent be upheld, even though critical ideas might seem unpalatable. It is in the state’s own interest to tolerate ideas critical of it. Criticism of the state and its policies is a natural outcome of the democratic system of governance … the security of the state must not be projected by the state itself to be so fragile that critical speech would shake its foundation.”

— Justice Babar Sattar in the case of Shoukat Ali vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135)
On Friday, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were arrested while they were reportedly on the way to the Islamabad district courts. The multiple cases registered against them invoke provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), anti-terrorism legislation, and laws regulating public assembly. Their arrest demonstrates how the law is being employed to silence opposition, revealing a state increasingly at war with dissent.
The allegations against Imaan include ‘offensive tweets’ against ‘important state institutions’. While Imaan is being prosecuted for posting content, Hadi is being prosecuted for reposting and resharing her content. Even clicking ‘repost’ on content that the state finds objectionable can subject an individual to criminal prosecution.
A state that treats criticism as a crime undermines both democracy and the rule of law. When lawyers are punished for challenging state excesses, it is not just an attack on individuals, but on the legal system itself.
Peca: an instrument of control
When Peca was amended last year to include a punishment for “false and fake information” through Section 26-A, the government claimed the aim was to counter misinformation. The intent was clear then, and it is clear now: the amendment has nothing to do with fake news. It is an instrument of control. The Peca case against Imaan and Hadi includes provisions of cyberterrorism and the offence of fake/false information.
The fundamental problem with Peca is that it has been structured in a manner to shield state institutions from criticism. By defining “unlawful content” as “aspersions against any person, including members of the judiciary, the armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly”, the amendment seeks to elevate members of these institutions above public scrutiny or accountability. Constitutional democracies do not insulate individuals from criticism; they protect a citizen’s right to free speech.
Freedom Network, a media watchdog that works on freedom of speech, reported that as per the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, 150 journalists faced charges under Peca in December 2024 alone, “often for allegedly spreading false narratives against state institutions”. When a law is enforced primarily against lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders, its purpose is clear.

 

Case after case, the reliance on a vague charge of propagating a “false narrative against the state” reveals the true function of Peca: it is not about countering misinformation, but transforming lawful dissent into a punishable offence.
No society can claim to be governed by the rule of law when those defending it are themselves under attack.
A mockery of the justice system
When the Islamabad High Court granted Imaan and Hadi time to appear before the trial court in the Peca case and expressly ordered that they shall not be arrested in the case, another first information report (FIR) suddenly emerged against them, levelling absurd allegations.
The state’s conduct exposes a dangerous and unlawful pattern. When courts provide protection, coercive machinery is redeployed through new FIRs to nullify that relief. This creates a situation where court orders are rendered meaningless. If such conduct is permitted, the courts cease to operate as a check on executive power and judicial orders are immediately undone by executive action.
According to reports, an FIR against Imaan was registered for a protest in February 2025, the day the Judicial Commission of Pakistan convened to appoint judges to the Supreme Court pursuant to the 26th Amendment. It also names several other lawyers who were at the protest.
The FIR alleges, among other things, that slogans were raised against the constitutional amendment, the higher judiciary, and other state institutions. No action was taken at the time (nearly a year ago). Instead, criminal cases purportedly lodged months earlier are allowed to remain dormant, without investigation, only to be suddenly revived when judicial protection is granted in an unrelated case.
The latest FIR also includes provisions of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act 2024, an oppressive law that effectively does away with the right to protest in Islamabad. The law defines ‘assembly’ as any gathering of more than 15 people, and makes assemblies subject to prior permission from the district magistrate. Authorities have the power to “recall” or “amend” permission. A police officer, on the instructions of the district magistrate, can order dispersal of a protest “likely to disturb the public peace”. The law imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment of up to three years or fines for being a member of an assembly classified as unlawful.
The message that is being sent through these cases is that no form of dissent — whether online or on the streets — is acceptable. Legal resistance will be met with retaliation.
Speaking out against enforced disappearances on social media is being treated as a criminal offence. Protesting against the destructive constitutional amendments can lead to criminal cases being registered.
The anti-terrorism law was introduced as a special law to address terrorism offences, and special courts were created to hear terrorism cases. Using this law against human rights defenders, journalists, and lawyers subverts its very purpose. There are reports of a spike in terrorism incidents, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Yet, the state is focusing its resources on categorising human rights defenders and lawyers as terrorists.
The misuse of power is a betrayal of the state’s responsibility. And this conduct reflects a deliberate strategy of intimidation designed to silence voices that hold state power accountable.
The visuals and manner of the arrest were equally shameful. “Eyewitnesses report that law enforcement officials used undue force against both the lawyers, and no reasons were provided at the time of arrest, raising serious concerns about their safety,” per Amnesty International.







Imaan’s mother, former federal minister for human rights Dr Shireen Mazari said: “I have no idea where my daughter and her husband have been taken”.







The state’s actions signal a breakdown of the law and the increasing capacity of the state to act with complete impunity. Arresting individuals without informing them of the charge and withholding information from their legal counsel and families is a clear violation of due process. Such actions are the hallmarks of authoritarianism, not lawful governance.
Post-amendment judiciary
While two officers of the court are subjected to legal harassment, the post-amendment judiciary serves its intended purpose by allowing it to continue. A society in which the judiciary does not defend rights and prevent blatant abuse of power is a frightening place, leaving citizens entirely unprotected and vulnerable to arbitrary executive action.

 

As per the 26th and 27th amendments, the Judicial Commission, including members of the executive, shall conduct an “annual performance evaluation” of the judges of high courts. If judges are to be “evaluated” by a commission that has government representatives on it, independent decision-making is compromised. If a judge renders a decision against the government, the government representatives in the commission may render a negative evaluation against the judge. The provision effectively places a sword of Damocles over the judiciary and allows the executive to intimidate judges.
Imaan and Hadi are among the few lawyers in Pakistan who consistently represent the most vulnerable victims of state abuse, from families of victims of enforced disappearances to those caught up in blasphemy cases. Pakistan’s fear of its human rights defenders is a confession: the truth is more threatening than anything else.
This is not just about two individuals facing legal harassment. It is about the reality that tomorrow it could be any lawyer, journalist, or citizen who speaks out and challenges state excesses.</p><small>2026-01-24 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241443190e1847e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968791/china-says-top-military-official-under-investigation-for-serious-violations-of-discipline' target='_blank'><strong>China says top military official under investigation for ‘serious violations of discipline’</strong></a><br><p>China said on Saturday the senior vice chairman of its powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) and another high-ranking official were under investigation for suspected “serious violations of discipline”, a common euphemism for corruption.
The announcement marks the latest push in a sweeping drive to root out graft at all levels of the party and state since President Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago.
“Following a review… it has been decided to initiate an investigation into Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli,” the defence ministry said in a statement.
The two men were “suspected of serious violations of discipline and the law”, the ministry said.
Zhang Youxia, 75, is China’s highest-ranked general as the more senior CMC vice chairman.
He is also a member of the powerful Politburo, the 24-member executive body of the Chinese Communist Party.

He shares the vice chairman title with Zhang Shengmin, a general in Beijing’s secretive rocket force and who is no relation.
Zhang Shengmin was promoted to the post in October after Beijing expelled his predecessor in another sweeping corruption purge.
Both generals rank below Xi, who has held the CMC chairmanship since 2012.
Liu, 61, is the chief of staff of the CMC’s joint staff department, which oversees combat planning.
Rumours of a probe swirled this week after Zhang Youxia and Liu appeared to miss an official meeting chaired by Xi and attended by second-ranked CMC vice chairman Zhang Shengmin.

 

Xi has called graft the “biggest threat” to the Communist Party and said “the fight against corruption remains grave and complex”.
Proponents say the policy promotes clean governance, but others say it also serves as a tool for Xi to purge political rivals.
In October, China announced it had launched corruption investigations into nine military officials.
As part of those probes, the defence ministry said it had expelled two top generals from the military.
They were He Weidong, the former second-ranked CMC vice chairman, and Miao Hua, the former head of the military’s political work department.
In 2024, former Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu was expelled from the Communist Party after being ousted over offences including suspected bribery.
Li’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also expelled from the party and passed on to prosecutors over alleged corruption.</p><small>2026-01-24 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24122911c205e5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968781/over-1500-people-rescued-after-heavy-snowfall-in-kps-tirah-valley-rescue-operations-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Over 1,500 people rescued after heavy snowfall in KP’s Tirah Valley; rescue operations continue</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: After heavy snowfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, rescue teams continued operations to evacuate those trapped by the snow, a spokesperson said on Saturday.
A large number of displaced families leaving Tirah in preparation for an operation in the valley were stranded in a snowstorm in Khyber district on Friday.
KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement that the rescue operations were ongoing for those trapped in the valley.
“Rescue 1122 has so far rescued more than 1,500 people and 350 vehicles and shifted them to safe places during the rescue operation, while more than 100 people have also been provided medical assistance,” he said.

The spokesperson added that over 100 personnel and officers from Khyber, Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera and Swabi’s Rescue 1122 divisions were participating in the operation.
In a later statement, Faizi said that the rescue operation had been ongoing for more than 36 hours.
“Despite the severe cold, sub-zero temperatures and difficult routes, rescue personnel are in the field and are carrying out rescue activities without interruption,” he said.
The Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah Valley in view of the heavy snowfall, asking them to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather.
Citizens advised to avoid travel
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said that the Murree Expressway had been opened to limited traffic due to an improvement in the weather conditions.
“However, due to the changing weather conditions and increasing rush, there is a possibility of closing the Murree Expressway,” the spokesperson added, requesting the public to avoid unnecessary travel.







The spokesperson said that the motorway police had performed their duties with diligence during the heavy snowfall and that traffic was controlled via the “best strategy according to the situation”, adding that the relevant officers themselves were in the field taking the lead.
According to the motorways spokesperson, more rain and snowfall is predicted in Murree and Galiyat on Monday and Tuesday.
NHMP’s media department requested that tourists cooperate with the Motorway Police, who would be on alert 24 hours a day to prevent any sudden disaster.
“The Motorway Police will be present to guide and protect tourists,” it said.
It advised citizens to contact its helpline at 130 in case of emergency and obtain guidance from the Motorway Police’s social media accounts before starting the journey.</p><small>2026-01-24 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24091228b18aa16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968774/iran-will-treat-any-attack-as-all-out-war-against-us-says-senior-iran-official' target='_blank'><strong>Iran will treat any attack as ‘all-out war against us,’ says senior Iran official</strong></a><br><p>Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.
“This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said.
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.
“If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like.
“A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said.
The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.
However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program.
Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights
At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation.
Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster.
“Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP.
The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights.
“Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said.
KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.
The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS.
Trump has repeatedly threatened US strikes on Iran over the crackdown on the protest movement that recently erupted across the Islamic republic.
The prospect of military action appeared to recede last week after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators, but Trump on Thursday confirmed continuing military preparations.

In a weather forecast, the PMD predicted a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, while it is expected to drop further between 7°C and 9°C on Sunday.
On Monday night, the minimum temperature is forecasted to rise slightly to 8-10°C.
Meanwhile, the maximum temperature is expected to remain between 19-21°C on Saturday and Sunday, rising further to between 20°C and 22°C on Monday.


Partial screengrab of the PMD weather forecast issued on Jan 24, 2026.

According to the Met Office, the humidity levels are predicted to remain between 40 and 55 per cent in the morning during the next three days, while at night, humidity can fall to between 10 and 25pc.
Northeast/easterly winds are expected to prevail till Monday, PMD added.
On Friday, the PMD predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country from Sunday night to Tuesday, with daytime temperatures likely to drop during the period.
According to the Met Office, a westerly wave is likely to approach western parts of the country on January 25 (Sunday) and is expected to grip the upper parts on January 26 (Monday).

Under the influence of this weather system, rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall are expected in most parts of Balochistan on Sunday night and on Monday. Upper Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Dadu, is also likely to receive rain on Monday.
Rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall, including heavy snowfall at a few places, are also expected in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). The weather system is also expected to affect several parts of KP and Punjab.
The weather forecasts come as heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides have brought life to a standstill across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, GB and AJK — blocking roads, stranding travelers, and disrupting electricity and relief operations.

The first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the proposal began Friday. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said the discussions focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”.
An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and western Europe for hewing too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers.
Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine.
The UAE foreign ministry said in a statement that the talks were scheduled to last two days and were “part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis”.
Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.
Donbas dispute
The Emirates meeting began as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes.
The European Union, which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of “deliberately depriving civilians of heat”.
Further Russian strikes killed one person and injured 22 others in Ukraine’s capital and the northeastern city of Kharkiv overnight, authorities said early Saturday.
“Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram, adding that several non-residential buildings had been hit and telling residents to remain in shelters.
While diplomacy to end Europe’s worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory.
Hours after Putin met Witkoff — and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood.
“Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“This is a very important condition,” he added.
Kyiv, which still controls around 20 per cent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms.
‘Desire to end the war’
Ahead of the talks Zelensky told reporters territory remained a “key issue” — with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region.
In a post online, he later added: “It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well.”
Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers.
The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration’s plan.
Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail.
After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was “genuinely interested in resolving” the war diplomatically.
But he added: “Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives… on the battlefield.” Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation.
Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.
“I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don’t, they’re stupid — that goes for both of them,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2413001153662fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968784/europe-and-india-seek-closer-ties-with-mother-of-all-deals' target='_blank'><strong>Europe and India seek closer ties with ‘mother of all deals’</strong></a><br><p>India and Europe hope to strike the “mother of all deals” when European Union (EU) chiefs meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties.
Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact — and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line.
“We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week.
Von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa will attend Republic Day celebrations on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord.
Securing a pact, described by India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal as “the mother of all deals”, would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.
But officials have been eager to stress there is more to it than commerce.
“The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday.
‘Untapped potential’
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have brought momentum to the relationship between India and the EU, said Praveen Donthi, of the International Crisis Group think tank.
“The EU eyes the Indian market and aims to steer a rising power like India away from Russia, while India seeks to diversify its partnerships, doubling down on its strategy of multi-alignment at a time when its relations with the US have taken a downward turn,” he said.

The summit will offer Brussels the chance to turn the page after a bruising transatlantic crisis over Greenland — now seemingly defused.
Together, the EU and India account for about a quarter of the world’s population and GDP.
Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn ) in trade in services.
But both parties are eager to do more.
“India still accounts for around only around 2.5 per cent of total EU trade in goods, compared with close to 15 per cent for China,” an EU official said, adding the figure gave a sense of the “untapped potential” an agreement could unlock.
EU makers of cars, machinery and chemicals have much to gain from India lowering entry barriers, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, an analyst at Brussels think tank Bruegel, who led EU trade talks with New Delhi over a decade ago.
“India is one of the most heavily protected economies in the world, with very, very high tariffs, including on many products where the European Union has a competitive advantage,” he told AFP.

 

With its economy in the doldrums, the 27-member EU is also pushing to ease exports of spirits and wines and strengthen intellectual property rules.
India — the fastest-growing major economy in the world — wants easier market access for products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals.
Defence pact
EU officials were tight-lipped about the deal’s contents as negotiations are ongoing.
But agriculture, a sensitive topic in both India and Europe, is likely to play a limited role, with New Delhi eager to protect its dairy and grain sectors.
Talks are focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Still, EU officials said they were confident negotiations could be concluded in time for the summit.
An accord on mobility to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, is also on the menu, alongside a security and defence pact.
The latter envisages closer cooperation in areas including maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism, an EU official said. It is also a “precondition” for the possible joint production of military equipment, said a second EU official.

 

New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base.
Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the US.
“We’re ready to open a new chapter in EU-India relationships, and really to unlock what we think is the transformative potential of this partnership,” said another EU official.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/240830217f24145.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968717/world-spends-30-destroying-nature-for-every-1-spent-protecting-it' target='_blank'><strong>World spends $30 destroying nature for every $1 spent protecting it</strong></a><br><p>• UNEP report says total nature-negative finance flows reached $7.3tr in 2023• Private sources accounted for $4.9tr
ISLAMABAD: For every $1 the world invests in protecting nature, it spends $30 on destroying it. This stark imbalance is the central finding of a new report released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
The ‘State of Finance for Nature 2026’ report finds that total nature-negative finance flows stand at $7.3 trillion. Of this, $4.9tr comes from private sources, highly concentrated in a few sectors including utilities, industrials, energy, and basic materials. Public environmentally harmful subsidies — mainly for fossil fuels, agriculture, water, transport and construction — amounted to $2.4tr in 2023.
Released on Thursday, the rep­ort called for a major shift in global financing towards nature-based solutions (NbS) and the phasing out of harmful investments to deliver high returns, reduce risk exposure, and enhance resilience.
The report further finds that finance flows for NbS totalled $220 billion, with nearly 90 per cent coming from public sources, reflecting a steady rise in domestic and international support.
Globally, finance flows remain heavily skewed towards nature-negative activities, threatening ecosystems, economies and human well-being. Nearly half of the global economy significantly depends on nature, yet governments, businesses and financial institutions continue to erode the world’s collective natural capital.
In 2023, finance directly harmful to nature reached $7.3tr, while investments in NbS amounted to only $220bn. To meet global commitments under the Rio Conventions, NbS investment must increase by more than two and a half times to $571bn by 2030, while harmful finance flows must be phased out and repurposed, emphasised the report.
While finance for NbS has continued to grow, it remains far below the level required to meet global biodiversity, climate and land restoration goals.

ISLAMABAD: Young people are under-represented in positions of power and often excluded from policy decisions that disproportionately affect them, such as on public debt, climate change and, most directly, education, said a new Unesco report released on Friday on the eve of International Day of Education.
Unesco’s Global Education Monitoring Report 2026, titled “Lead with youth”, said that while young people and students are not well represented in formal politics, they remain politically active and frequently demand good governance and social justice.
“They want their voices to be heard and to be engaged meaningfully on issues that affect their present and future, notably on education,” it said.
It added that youth and students’ calls for meaningful engagement in education decision-making are part of a broader global movement for youth agency that has grown over the past three decades.
The report said stronger youth and student engagement requires formal mechanisms and a seat at decision-making tables, representative and inclusive participation, institutional support and resources, and the willingness of authorities to value and act on feedback.
According to the report, only one in three countries has formal bodies to engage youth or students in education discussions.
However, the report found that satisfaction with engagement is lowest among school student groups. Asked to assess the depth of their participation, ranging from exclusion to being treated as valued partners, only 20 per cent said they felt they were genuinely collaborating with government or that their contributions mattered. Satisfaction rises when students are given formal roles and responsibilities in policy reform, it added.
Meanwhile, in a message issued on the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari said Pakistan’s future was closely linked to its youth.
“As a nation with a rich cultural heritage and a large young population, we must ensure that education nurtures curiosity, competence and character. It should enable young people to think critically, act ethically and contribute positively to their communities,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was paying special attention to promoting higher education and skills through various programmes to strengthen the education system and empower youth.
In a message on International Day of Education, he said Pakistan joined the international community in recognising those associated with education and training, including students, teachers, parents, educators and researchers.
To mark the day, Unesco and the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training held an event at Islamabad Model College for Girls under the global theme, ‘The Power of Youth in Co-creating Education’, with organisers saying the forum aimed to bring students into education policy discussions.
Minister of State for Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar described education as a national priority, calling it “the most powerful investment a country can make”.
Unesco’s representative in Pakistan, Fuad Pashayev, said the education emergency could not be addressed through policy alone and stressed that young people were “not just the future” but also the present.
Separately, the World Bank said its group was the largest financier of education in the developing world, with a $26.4 billion portfolio across 81 countries, supporting 324 million students to date through education-related programmes.

Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause.
He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added.
According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework.
Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance.

Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long

Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled.
“With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024.
He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security.
As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said.
Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said.
Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China.
“The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift.
He also criticised the “Board of Peace” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process.
Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved.
“The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said.
However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said.
‘Diplomatic honeymoon’
In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations.
Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia.
“This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long.
“The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said.
“Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.”
Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States.
“The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

Taliban authorities have told them that Pakistani diplomatic missions should officially approach them and verify the list with an official stamp. However, Pakistani officials are reluctant to do so, the affected students told Dawn from Kabul and Jalalabad.
The Taliban allowed the first group of 26 students to cross Torkham on Jan 12, and Pakistani authorities also opened the border specifically for them.
However, the students who arrived at Torkham on Jan 13 have not yet been allowed to cross, as Taliban authorities insist that the Pakistani embassy or the consulate in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, should officially verify the list.
Dr Riazullah Wazir and Amanullah Wazir, representatives of the students in Kabul, said students had met the Nangarhar governor and officials at the Pakistani embassy and the Jalalabad consulate, but the issue remained unresolved.
Dr Noman Amir, the students’ representative in Jalalabad, said the current tensions had multiplied their problems, leaving them stuck in Afghanistan for months. He added that the students could not cross the border despite repeated requests to authorities on both sides.
“Visas of many students have expired, and they cannot travel to Islamabad due to the border closure. Dozens of students are also stuck in Pakistan and are facing difficulties attending exams and classes in Afghanistan,” Dr Amir, a final-year medical student in Jalalabad, told Dawn.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul remained in contact with the Pakistani community and assistance was extended to those who approached it.
“We will explore how these 200 students can be facilitated. It is currently winter holidays, and many students may be seeking to return during this time. We will review the situation accordingly after receiving updated information from our embassy,” Mr Andrabi said at his weekly briefing.
However, Dr Amir said that the parents of a couple of students had passed away in Pakistan, but the students were unable to attend their funerals.
“Our exams have ended and winter vacations have already started in Afghanistan, but students still cannot go to Pakistan,” he said. He added that students had contacted officials on both sides, but no one had taken “our problems seriously”.
He appealed to PM Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari to take notice of their situation and find a solution to their problem.
A Pakistani official, requesting not to be identified, told Dawn that the Torkham border was meant to remain open for two days, Jan 12 and 13. He said Pakistan had taken the decision after students stated in a video that the Afghan side had promised to allow them to cross the border.
“We held consultations in Islamabad and decided to open Torkham for our students. But now the Taliban have attached conditions for allowing them to cross,” he said, adding that Pakistan had also agreed to open the border for more students even after Jan 13.
The problem started when students arrived at Torkham on Jan 13 after the first group had already entered Pakistan.
“We spent two nights at Torkham and were hoping to cross the border, but it did not happen,” students said in a video posted online.
One student said the Afghan interior ministry told them to have the list verified with an official stamp from the Pakistani embassy. He claimed that neither the embassy nor the consulate agreed to the demand. However, a consulate official said the mission was in contact with the students as well as officials in Islamabad to resolve the issue.
An official in Islamabad said Pakistan would not make any official communication with the Taliban authorities.
“If they allow the students [to cross], we will open the border crossing,” the official told Dawn.

ABBOTTABAD: Rescue officials remove snow from their vehicle after heavy snowfall blanketed the Galiyat with a coat of white. According to the Met Office, more rain and snowfall is expected in various parts of the country from Sunday.—Dawn

• KKH, other major roads blocked• Murree sees 15 inches of snow• Quetta records coldest night at -13°C• More rain, snow expected from Sunday
CHITRAL/GILGIT/RAWALPINDI/QUETTA: At least nine members of a family were killed when a snow avalanche buried their house in Chitral on Friday, as heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides brought life to a standstill across Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, blocking roads, stranding travellers and disrupting electricity and relief operations amid freezing temperatures.
The avalanche struck a house in Serigal village of the Damil area in the extreme south of the district on Friday afternoon. Lower Chitral Deputy Comm­issioner Hashim Azim said the bodies were recovered from the debris, while a nine-year-old boy survived and was rushed to hospital.
Officials said the avalanche was triggered after the area received over 20 inches of snowfall, with a huge mass of snow sliding down from a nearby pasture and hitting the isolated house in the sparsely populated mountainous village.
The deceased were identified as Bacha Khan, his wife, three sons, two daughters and two daughters-in-law. They were reportedly dining in the central room of the house when the avalanche struck.
Snowfall continued uninterrupted for more than 36 hours across the Chitral valley, from Arandu to Broghil, severely disrupting daily life. Vehicular traffic was suspended on several roads, including the approach road to the Lowari Tunnel, where thousands of passengers remained stranded for around 18 hours before traffic was restored on Friday evening after snow clearance.
Several roads in Upper and Lower Chitral remain closed due to heavy snowfall. Electricity supply was also disrupted after snowfall at Lowari Top severed the national transmission line connecting Chitral.
Large parts of KP received heavy rain and snowfall during the ongoing weather spell, resulting in road blockages, suspension of power supply and extreme cold. The mountains surrounding the Peshawar valley also received heavy snowfall, triggering a cold wave accompanied by chilly winds.
In Khyber district, a large number of displaced families returning from Tirah were stranded amid a snowstorm. Rescue 1122 said an operation was underway in Tirah Valley, Painda Cheena, Dawatoi and Bagh Maidan.
Gilgit-Baltistan
Meanwhile, fresh snowfall across GB on Friday further worsened conditions, triggering road blockages, power outages and extreme cold across the region.
In Chipurson valley of Gojal, upper Hunza, the situation of earthquake-affected families living in tents deteriorated as snowfall hampered relief activities.
Local residents said hundreds of families were facing severe shortages of food, medicine and heating facilities, with temperatures dropping to below minus 20 degrees Celsius.
Police said five to six inches of snow was recorded in upper areas of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Ghizer, Kharmang, Diamer, Hunza and Nagar. Major roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Highway and Ghizer-Shandur Road, were blocked at multiple locations due to heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides.
As a result, hundreds of passengers, including women, children and elderly people, were stranded for hours in various areas, particularly in Kohistan, where vehicles were stuck in extreme cold with limited access to food and shelter.
Later, the Kohistan administration cleared parts of the KKH and arranged food and temporary accommodation for stranded passengers.
Authorities said heavy snowfall cut off several communities from road access, while prolonged power outages of over 20 hours were reported in upper areas, forcing residents to struggle for firewood and heating.
Murree records 15 inches of snowfall
Heavy rain accompanied by a hailstorm lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Friday, while 15 inches of snowfall was recorded in Murree. Heavy snowfall in Murree intensified the cold, with the temperature dropping to four degrees Celsius. The Met Office said temperatures were likely to fall further in the coming days. Owing to the snowfall, the Murree Expressway was closed.
Around 15 inches of snowfall was recorded in Murree, prompting the district administration to stop the entry of vehicles into the hill station.
Balochistan
Biting cold continued to grip Quetta and several other districts of Balochistan, severely disrupting daily life. Residents of Quetta experienced the coldest night of the current winter season on Thursday as the mercury plunged to minus 13 degrees Celsius, while the absence of gas supply left households struggling to keep warm amid icy Siberian winds that blew throughout the night.
Temperatures dropped sharply, with Kalat recording minus 12 degrees Celsius and Ziarat minus 11 degrees, paralysing routine life in Quetta, Kalat, Ziarat and surrounding areas.
Normal life was severely affected, with people seen searching for gas cylinders to heat their homes as gas pressure remained extremely low.
Water supply through Wasa tube wells was suspended after pipelines burst due to sub-zero temperatures and power outages in various parts of the provincial capital and its surrounding areas.
Roads and streets in Quetta wore a deserted look as most shops in commercial areas remained closed. Traffic remained thin, with most vehicles off the roads.
Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority carried out a timely rescue operation near Muslim Bagh, safely evacuating 17 stranded people, including 14 women and children, who were trapped on a road due to severe weather conditions.
In the Zhob area, army troops assisted the local administration in rescuing people stranded on the N-50 after snow froze on the highway.
Forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country from Sunday night to Tuesday, with daytime temperatures likely to drop during the period.
According to the Met Office, a westerly wave is likely to approach western parts of the country on Jan 25 (Sunday) and is expected to grip the upper parts on Jan 26.
Under the influence of this weather system, rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall are expected in most parts of Balochistan on Jan 25 (night) and Jan 26. Upper Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Dadu, is likely to receive rain on Jan 26.
Rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall, including heavy snowfall at a few places, are also expected in GB and Kashmir. The weather system is also expected to affect several parts of KP and Punjab.

Investors must be upbeat as 10-gram and one-tola gold rates have surged by Rs206,671 and Rs241,062, respectively, if compared with the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates at Rs234,568 and Rs273,600 prevailing on Jan 1, 2025.
The world gold price was $2,624, up $2,299 per ounce from the above period.
Silver (24kt) rate had surged to Rs10,275 per tola, up by Rs372, while the 10-gram rate soared to Rs8,809, up by Rs319, owing to an increase in the world silver price to $98 per ounce, up by $3.72.

The agreement was reac­hed as Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met a high-level Somali delegation led by Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yusuf at the Ministry of Interior. 
During the meeting, Mr Naqvi announced visa facilitation for Somali citizens tra­velling to Pakistan for medical treatment and education. 
Mr Naqvi assured his cou­nterpart of Pakistan’s full su­­pport to Somalia in policing and counterterrorism. He said Pakistan would extend complete cooperation to So­­m­­alia across multiple sectors.
Mr Yusuf said his country was “facing a difficult situation and was actively fighting terrorists”. He expressed hope that the visit would expand bilateral relations between the two countries. 
Mr Yusuf expressed a str­ong desire to benefit from Pa­­kistan’s experience, noting that Naqvi’s initiatives for Islamabad’s infrastructure development were commendable. Both ministers stressed the need for impro­ved coordination to advance shared interests in various sectors. 
The Somali interior minister formally invited Mr Naqvi to visit Somalia and delivered a special message from the prime minister of Somalia for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

A three-judge SC bench comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Nae­em Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shake­­el Ahmed announced the verdict.  
District and Sessions Judge Aijaz Ali Khaskheli, who joined the Sindh judicial service in 1996, was removed from office in 2016 by then SHC chief justice Sajjad Ali Shah who was later elevated to the Supreme Court and retired upon reaching superannuation in 2022. 
The controversy stemmed from an appeal filed by the former SHC chief justice through the court registrar, seeking clarification on a point of law: whether a service tribunal could interfere with the lawful exercise of discretion by the competent authority, namely the chief justice of the high court, in awarding punishment. 
Mr Khaskheli, who was serving as a judge of the accountability court in Hyderabad at the time, is the respondent in the appeal. 

Three-judge bench sets aside former SHC chief justice’s petition

He was appointed as a civil judge in 1996 and promoted to the rank of district and sessions judge in 2014. In 2016, he was suspended and subsequently dismissed following disciplinary proceedings initiated by the then SHC chief justice on allegations of misconduct. 
The former judicial officer later approached the Sindh Subordinate Judicial Service Tribunal, which had on Sept 30, 2024, ruled in his favour. The tribunal held that the disciplinary proceedings were procedurally flawed and that the penalty of dismissal was disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.
The tribunal also noted that the then chief justice, who was the complainant in the case, had acted as both the initiating and punishing authority, in violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua — that no one should be a judge in their own cause. 
The dispute arose after the respondent judge issued what was termed an “unlawful notice” to the then Hyderabad commissioner, seeking his personal attendance. The notice alleged that funds for the construction of a compound wall of a bungalow occupied by the respondent judge had been withheld by the commissioner. 
The commissioner approached the office of the SHC registrar, who brought the matter to the attention of the then chief justice. The respondent judge was subsequently dismissed from service. 
After the service tribunal decided in favour of the respondent judge last year, the matter came before the Supreme Court. The SHC registrar argued that the tribunal’s decision should be overturned, contending that it had erred in applying the law and that the dismissal was justified. 
Conversely, the counsel for the respondent judge submitted that the disciplinary proceedings were fundamentally flawed as the SHC chief justice, who initiated the complaint, also acted as the punishing authority. This, he argued, violated the principles of natural justice. 
The respondent further contended that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated without first repatriating him to his parent department, as required under the Sindh Civil Servants (E&D) Rules, 1973. It was also argued that he was removed without a regular departmental inquiry, which was mandatory under the relevant rules.

According to Dera Ismail Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada, the explosion occurred during a wedding celebration at the residence of the peace committee chief, identified as Noor Alam Mehsud.
The participants were reportedly dancing to the beat of a drum when the attack was carried out. The blast caused the room’s roof to collapse, hampering rescue operations and making it difficult to reach those trapped under the debris.
“The explosion was a suicide blast,” the DPO told Dawn. He said that an emergency had been imposed at the District Headquarter Hospital.
In a statement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said five bodies and 10 injured had been taken to the hospital.
He said that seven ambulances, a fire vehicle and a disaster vehicle reached the site of the incident soon after it was reported, adding that a rescue operation was under way.
Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the incident. Initial reports said peace committee leader Waheedullah Mehsud alias Jigri Mehsud was among the dead.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the blast and sought a report from the KP inspector general of police. According to a statement, he also directed law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident and identify those responsible.
He said the responsible parties would be brought to justice. “The provincial government shares the grief of the martyrs’ families. All possible assistance will be provided,” he said.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident, according to a statement from his office.
“All possible medical assistance should be provided to the injured in the Dera blast,” he was quoted as saying, expressing grief over the incident.
Earlier this month, armed assailants had killed four members of a peace committee in KP’s Bannu district.
In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked, also in KP’s Bannu district. Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
