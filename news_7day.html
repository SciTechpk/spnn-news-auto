This comes as US President Donald Trump said on Friday he will start talking to China on Monday or Tuesday about a possible TikTok deal. He said the United States “pretty much” has a deal on the sale of the TikTok short-video app.
TikTok has developed a plan to launch the new app in US app stores on September 5, the report said.
Last month, Trump extended to September 17 a deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok.
The report added that TikTok users will eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, although the existing app will work until March of next year, though the timeline could change.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A deal had been in the works earlier this year to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new US-based firm, majority-owned and operated by American investors. That was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump said the United States will probably have to get a deal approved by China.</p><small>2025-07-06 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0618170583cf3f3.jpg?r=181916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498/6-die-in-flash-floods-rains-in-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>6 die in flash floods, rains in KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Six people were killed while one person was injured on Sunday amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMA) in both provinces.
At least 22 people have been killed and 11 others have been injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.
Additionally, PDMA warned on Friday that the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) — the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake — has increased in glacial areas of the province due to increasing temperatures, which in turn has raised the risk of additional flooding.
Today’s report from the PDMA outlined that four people were killed in KP while another was injured due to heavy rainfall and flash floods, according to the PDMA’s reporting officers in Malakand and Hazara divisions.
The PDMA said that three rooms in a house in the Buner district’s Teenolo Dheri village collapsed, killing a woman and injuring a man. Separately, in Buner, a temporary bridge pillar at Faizabad Khwar was swept away.
In Malakand, a flash flood caused by heavy rainfall swept through the Heero Shah union council, killing three people.
According to the PDMA report, one woman and two children were swept away. The woman and one of the children drowned.
“Rescue 1122 recovered [a] female body, while two children are still missing,” the report read, adding that a rescue operation was underway.
Rescue 1122 later issued an update stating that one of the children had been rescued.
Meanwhile, Dargai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Shahbaz Khan told Dawn.com that a woman and her grandson drowned in the Zor Mandi nullah as they were crossing it.
“Both bodies were recovered by Rescue 1122 and moved to Dargai hospital,” he stated.
Dargai Additional AC Waheedullah told Dawn.com that there was heavy rain in the mountains of Kot and the Hiro Shah Dargai area in the morning.
“Flash floods occurred in small, dry nullahs originating from the mountains and leading to small streams,” he said. “A nine-year-old boy was swept away by the flash flood in a small dry nullah. His grandmother, around 55-years-old, tried to save him but was also swept away.
The additional AC said that a rescue operation was launched immediately and that the boy’s body was recovered from the Pir Kalay Harichan Charsadda/Badragga Malakand boundary, while the body of the woman was recovered from the Zormandi Quaidabad area.
Additional AC Waheedullah further said that he was present in the field and people were discouraged from approaching or crossing the nullahs through announcements and the deployment of Levies personnel.
Additionally, three cows were rescued from flash floods in the Zormandi area.
“The bodies are being transported to Arang Bajaur and an ambulance from Rescue 1122 was arranged,” Waheedullah added.
In Mansehra, the PDMA stated in its report that an an 18-year-old resident of Rawalpindi had drowned in a flash flood in Putwar Halqa Jabba which was caused by heavy rain.
Amir Khadam, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Mansehra, told Dawn.com that the young man drowned when he was crossing a nullah in the Mansehra district with his motorcycle on Sunday morning.
“The body of the deceased was recovered from floodwater in the Ghotar area and was turned over to his heirs,” Khadam said.
The PDMA added that due to the heavy rainfall, landslides were reported in Buner’s Pandriks union council and Torghar district’s Tharala area. Both events caused traffic blockages and heavy machinery was deployed to clear the roads.
Heavy rain continues to lash Punjab
Meanwhile, a PDMA report on monsoon rains in various districts of Punjab, including Lahore, was released today.
According to a PDMA spokesperson, dilapidated and decaying houses collapsed amid heavy rain, with two dead and six injured in various accidents.
“A woman and a child were killed due to the collapse of dilapidated and decaying buildings in Rawalpindi and Gujranwala,” said the spokesperson. “Two dilapidated and mud houses were affected due to monsoon rains.”
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said in a statement that he expected heavy rain to persist in Punjab until July 10.
“Heavy monsoon rains are expected in most parts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said. “Stay in safe places during thunderstorms and do not shelter in mud houses or dilapidated buildings.
“During rain, slow down the speed of your vehicle and maintain a reasonable distance,” he urged.
He also instructed medical institutions to provide the best medical assistance to the injured.
“As per the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, citizens’ losses will be compensated,” Kathia instructed. “Assistance will also be provided to the relatives of the deceased as per government policy.”
According to the report, Lahore recorded the highest amount of rainfall in Paniwala Talab, at 74 millimetres (mm).
Similarly, 72mm fell in Lakshmi Chowk, 57mm on Jail Road, 52mm in Nishtar Town, 52mm in Farrukhabad, 51mm in Gulberg, 37mm at the airport, 33mm in Mughal Pura and 44mm at Qurtaba Chowk.

Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg took third for the veteran German’s first-ever podium in 239 race starts.
Briton Norris returned to a rapturous reception from his home fans as he moved to within eight points of Piastri in the drivers’ standings.
“It’s beautiful, everything I ever dreamed of, this is everything I wanted to achieve, aside from winning the championship this is as good as it gets,” beamed Norris.
Piastri, who finished less than seven seconds behind Norris, threw away the win after the Australian was hit with a 10-second penalty for a safety car infringement.
As last week’s heatwave gave way to a more typical British summer’s day — spells of blue sky mixed with torrential showers — drivers had to keep their wits about them with puddles forming on the track.
Norris emerged from the chaos all smiles as he added to his wins already this season in Austria, Monaco and Australia.
Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton came in fourth ahead of polesitter Max Verstappen for Red Bull.
Piastri fell foul of the stewards when braking heavily before the safety car peeled off, a decision that left Piastri feeling robbed.
“I’m not going to say much, I don’t want to get myself in trouble,” he said in the post-race interview. “Apparently, you can’t brake behind the safety car anymore.”
For Hulkenberg, 37, this was a day to remember as he climbed the podium for the first time since joining the F1 grid way back in 2010.
“Podium — P3 baby!” said his ecstatic race engineer on the team radio after he crossed the line.
“I don’t think I can comprehend what we’ve just done,” replied the German.
Pierre Gasly’s Alpine took sixth, with Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Alex Albon (Williams), Fernando Alonso in the other Aston and George Russell (Mercedes) rounding out the top 10.</p><small>2025-07-06 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06211013c53d184.jpg?r=211103' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922481/desperate-search-for-missing-girls-as-texas-flood-death-toll-rises-to-59' target='_blank'><strong>Desperate search for missing girls as Texas flood death toll rises to 59</strong></a><br><p>Rescuers in Texas raced against time on Sunday to find dozens of missing people, including children, swept away by flash floods that killed at least 59, as forecasters warned of new deluges.
Local Texans joined forces with disaster officials to search through the night for the missing, including 27 girls from a riverside Christian summer camp.
The rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached tree tops and the roofs of cabins in the camp as girls slept, washing away some of them and leaving a scene of devastation.
At the camp in Kerr County, blankets, teddy bears and other belongings ended up caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Camp Mystic on the banks of the Guadalupe River, where some 750 girls had been staying when the floodwaters hit, had been “horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I’ve seen in any natural disaster.”
“We won’t stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins,” he said in a post on social media platform X after a visit to the site.
 






Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said heavy rain likely to cause more flooding was falling Sunday as the death toll at the camp and elsewhere rose to at least 59.
“We expect that to go higher, sadly,” Patrick told Fox News on Sunday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) warned Sunday that slow-moving thunderstorms threatened more flash floods over the saturated ground of central Texas.

The flooding began on Friday — the start of the July 4 holiday weekend — as months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours, much of it coming overnight as people slept. The Guadalupe surged some 8 meters — more than a two-storey building — in just 45 minutes.
Some of the fatalities were found in counties away from the tragedy at the summer camp. The owner and director of Camp Mystic was among the dead, according to the Kerrville website, as was the manager of another nearby summer camp.
Flash floods, which occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall, are not unusual.
The region of south and central Texas where the weekend’s deluge occurred is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”
But scientists say that in recent years human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense.
Cars, houses swept away
Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem said the US Coast Guard was “punching through storms” to evacuate stranded residents.
“We will fly throughout the night and as long as possible,” she said in a post on X.
 






Air, ground and water-based crews were scouring the length of the Guadalupe River for survivors and the bodies of the dead.
In Kerrville on Saturday, the usually calm Guadalupe was flowing fast, its murky waters filled with debris.
“The water reached the top of the trees. About 10 metres or so,” said resident Gerardo Martinez, 61. “Cars, whole houses were going down the river.”
Scientists and disaster management agencies have criticised US President Donald Trump for cutting funding and staffing at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in charge of weather forecasts and preparedness, and the NWS.
Noem earlier said Trump, who was at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club on Sunday, wanted to “upgrade the technologies” at the weather service and the NOAA.
“We need to renew this ancient system,” Noem told a press conference.
When asked about claims that residents were given insufficient warning, Noem said she would “carry your concerns back to the federal government.”
 






Devastation at Camp Mystic
Earlier on Saturday, Sheriff Leitha said 27 children from Camp Mystic in flooded Kerr County were still missing.
US media reported that four of the missing girls were dead, citing their families.
The windows of camp cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.
Michael, who only gave AFP his first name, was searching the camp for his eight-year-old daughter.

“I was in Austin and drove down yesterday morning, once we heard about it,” he said, adding that he was hoping for a “miracle.”
The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Camp Mystic’s owner and director Dick Eastland.
The director of Heart O’ The Hills summer camp, located about a mile from Camp Mystic, Jane Ragsdale, was also confirmed dead.
Elsewhere in Texas, four people were confirmed dead in Travis County, northeast of Kerr, and 13 people were missing, public information office director Hector Nieto told AFP.
A 62-year-old woman’s body was found in the city of San Angelo in Tom Green County, along the Concho River, police said.
Two more people died in Burnet County, the area’s emergency management coordinator, Derek Marchio, told AFP, bringing the state-wide death toll to 50.</p><small>2025-07-06 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062034108787d95.jpg?r=203547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-safely' target='_blank'><strong>Ashura processions in major cities of country conclude safely</strong></a><br><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country safely concluded on Sunday evening amid tightened security.

Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho praised the Karachi Police for excellent security arrangements during Muharram, according to a statement from his office.
“Majalis and processions were organised at several places in Karachi, including Nishtar Park,” he was quoted as saying, expressing appreciation for the Traffic Police for arranging alternative routes for the convenience of the general public during the main procession.
Additional IG Odho also thanked media representatives, procession organisers, mourners and other institutions for their cooperation, according to the statement.

Shah praised the role of religious scholars in maintaining religious harmony, calling their role “commendable”.
“Sindh is the land of Sufis. We are advocates of peace,” Shah stated.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also congratulated Sindh Police for their excellent security strategy and performance during Ashura.
“During this important occasion, security measures taken by all units of the Sindh Police, including the Traffic Police and Special Branch Police at the provincial level from Muharram 1 to Ashura, are commendable at every level,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.
Lanjar also praised and appreciated the performance of Rangers Sindh and other security agencies on this occasion.
Meanwhile, the central Ashura procession in Hyderabad culminated peacefully at Karbala Dadan Shah.
Every year, the procession departs from Qadam Gah Maula Ali and is managed by Anjuma-i-Hyderi, which was founded in 1948.
The entire route was sealed since the early morning with barbed wire, while police and Rangers personnel were deployed.
The procession reached St Mary’s Convent School roundabout, where mourners performed zohrain prayers. Subsequently, a majlis was addressed a small distance from the roundabout by Syed Wasim Hyder Zaidi, according to an Anjuman-i-Hyderi spokesman.
A majlis was also addressed by Allama Irfan Ali Kazmi before the procession departed from Qadam Gah.
The procession was delayed by over an hour at St Mary’s Chowk and passed the area at 5.15pm instead of the usual time of 4pm. This area also connects the route of the tazia procession from the city.
Police arrangements for security were also weak. No strict checking was seen and everyone was allowed to reach the procession route, especially from Universal Book Depot point. Some policemen who were initially seen for security purpose disappeared subsequently.
Deputy Inspector General Tariq Dharejo, Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio and Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abidin monitored the proceedings in the control room set up in the City police station.
Meanwhile, a statement from the Punjab government stated that processions were culminating safely in multiple cities across the province. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif congratulated her team, including Salman Rafique, ministers, institutions and others, for the “excellent arrangements”.
“For the first time, we had not only the best Muharram in terms of arrangements but also the most peaceful one,” Maryam was quoted as saying. “Along with cleaning the roads, the dirt of hatred was also wiped away.”
Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, accompanied by other ministers, arrived at the bridge of the Metro Bus Station, leaving Nisar Haveli in Lahore. She also visited the control room established at the Punjab Home Department and reviewed arrangements for Yaum-i-Ashura across the province in detail.
A briefing delivered to Aurangzeb confirmed that the processions were being monitored in real-time through 7,500 cameras across Punjab and that 113,000 personnel were deployed.
Additionally, more than 1,600 “hate-spreading accounts” were reported by the Cyber ​​Patrol Cell of the Home Department and 170 people were arrested, according to the briefing.
Aurangzeb was also briefed on the provision of clean water and clean procession routes, where water was sprinkled to cool mourners amid the heat and the spraying of disinfectants was continuous. Mobile toilets were also provided and rescue personnel were on standby in case of emergency.
A coordinated plan was also prepared with the Water and Power Distribution Authority (Wapda) and other institutions for uninterrupted power supply during Yaum-i-Ashura.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), being observed today.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.
In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”
In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”
He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p><small>2025-07-06 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06192529ddd3262.jpg?r=192557' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in Lyari building collapse stands at 27 as rescue operation ends on 3rd day</strong></a><br><p>Rescuers on Sunday concluded their operation to recover people from the site of a five-storey building which collapsed in Karachi earlier this week, with the final death toll standing at 27.
Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.
“The rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,” Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com. “No more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.”
The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.
Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was “because the building was dilapidated”.
“A day before the collapse, residents felt a ‘shock’. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building’s structure being shaken or dislocated,” Khan said. “There were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.”
Difficulties
The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.
“They sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,” Khan said. “It would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.”
Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced “immense pressure” from the relatives, he added.
Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.
“We used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,” Khan told Dawn.com. “The use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.”
He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.
At around 1:30pm, Khan told Dawn.com, “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.
A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.
Ten people who were injured have been discharged.
While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.
“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.
He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.
The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.
He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.
“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.
CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.
He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.
He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.
While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p><small>2025-07-06 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06164812ad80433.jpg?r=165147' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922497/reuters-x-accounts-withheld-in-india-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Reuters X accounts ‘withheld’ in India: local media</strong></a><br><p>The Reuters news agency’s X account handles were “withheld” in India “in response to a legal demand”, Indian outlet The Print reported on Sunday.
The accounts for both Reuters and Reuters World were inaccessible in India; however, users were still able to access 30 other Reuters accounts, The Print added. The Reuters news website is also accessible.
X users in India have posted screenshots showing that they are unable to access the news agency’s accounts.
 






Reuters has yet to issue a statement, while the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) told India Today that no order was given to restrict the accounts.
“There is no requirement from the Government of India to withhold the Reuters handle. We are continuously working with X to resolve the problem,” an official spokesperson for the ministry told outlet India Today.
 
 

The Print reported that in previous instances of X restricting access to accounts in India due to legal requirements, the platform issued statements through its Global Government Affairs handle.
The account has yet to issue a statement on the restriction.
This is not the first time India has blocked accounts on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.
According to an Instagram post by The Hindustan Times, the accounts were withheld as per orders issued amid Operation Sindoor, when India launched missiles at sites in Pakistan in May.
“The centre (government) has reportedly responded to social media platform X blocking the account of news agency Reuters in India, saying that it is a mistake on the part of the Elon Musk-owned company,” the outlet wrote in the post’s caption.

According to The Print, X issued a statement on May 8 saying it had “received executive orders from the Indian government” to “block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees”.
“In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India’s local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts,” X wrote.
Though X stated that it disagreed with New Delhi’s demands, the platform withheld access to the account solely within India.

Some carried sleepy toddlers in their arms; others held the hands of young boys or walked alongside their husbands. Men and children also mingled in the growing crowd.
They had come together for the cherished ritual of mannat at an Imambargah set in a modest house dating back to 1876. The passageway leading to the entrance was already packed with scores of women. “I couldn’t get in, but my son has gone inside,” said a young woman anxiously.
Moments later, her son, Danyal, returned. “I saw the ziarat. Let’s go now,” he told his mother, who had brought him all the way from their home in Qasimabad to seek blessings. “We’re not Shia Muslims — we’re Maulaee,” she clarified with quiet pride, using a term that reflects deep devotion to the fourth caliph of Islam and his family, who were martyred in Karbala in 63 Hijri.
The sea of women had gathered to perform the ritual of the mehndi of Shahzada Qasim, the son of Hazrat Imam Hassan (RA). Dozens of police officers had cordoned off the area, erecting barricades that brought the usual flow of traffic to a halt.
At this historic Imambargah, the mehndi is a women-led tradition. Inside, men and women alike lit candles, holding it on their palms as they whispered prayers for their wishes to be fulfilled. Many women brought adorned replicas of cradles into the house — symbols of gratitude that their prayers for a child had been answered.

“My wife has come here today,” said Sumair, cradling his baby girl in his arms. “She prayed here last year that I find a job,” he continued. “This year, I was appointed in the police, and so she has returned to offer thanks and pay her respect.”
Another young man stood clutching a flickering candle. “I want to marry, but my marriage keeps getting delayed,” said Awais.
The more one lingers among these devoted visitors, the more stories like his emerge — each a window into hearts burdened with worries and brimming with faith.
Gul Shah ki mehndi
Draped in black attire, which symbolises mourning for the martyrs of Karbala, Apa Kulsoom, sat quietly inside the Imambargah Gul Shah Bukhari, established in 1876. She is the custodian of the place which overflows with striking symbols of devotion: tiny cradles, decorated sehra, platters of sweets, replicas of alams, and henna. This ceremony, held every Muharram 7, is commonly known as Gul Shah ki Mehndi, a tradition that continues to draw the faithful year after year.

These items will be taken to Qadam Gah Maula Ali at Fajr on Muharram 8, when mourners from the pir that originates in Tando Mir Mahmood — one of Hyderabad’s oldest localities — arrive at Apa’s Imambargah. This pir, known as Jamaytan jo pir, has been carried out by Anjuman Safina-i-Hussaini since 1909.
The term pir, rooted in the Sindhi language, refers to the sacred ground or designated space for azadari — mourning rituals — or the very site where an alam rises skyward, bringing together people to honour the memory of Karbala.
As the ritual unfolds, women and young girls recite eulogies, recalling the martyrdom of Imam Hussain — the beloved grandson of the Holy Prophet  (PBUH) and son of Hazrat Ali (AS) — who, along with 72 of his loyal companions, was slain on the plains of Karbala, Iraq. Among the symbols of grief and reverence are small cradles, representing Ali Asghar, Imam Hussain’s youngest son and one of the youngest martyrs of Karbala.
Salamat Feroz is a poet who composed a tune for Shahzada Qasim’s mehndi ritual, which was recited by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan in 2022. This year, he produced Sajjad AS ki manzil bhari hai, in memory of Hazrat Sajjad, once again brought to life through Rahat’s stirring voice.
Reflecting on the significance of these rituals, Feroz explained, “The faithful perform the mehndi ceremony as an expression of their deep love for the Ahl-e-Bait. We all know Hazrat Qasim’s wedding never happened in Karbala — but it is precisely this unfulfilled hope that inspires people to continue this ritual today, keeping his memory alive.”
Historically, Hyderabad served as the capital of Sindh for many years, until the British conquest led by Charles Napier in 1843 wrested it from the Talpur dynasty. The British forces toppled the Talpur rulers and exiled them to Calcutta.
Hyderabad, named in honour of Islam’s fourth caliph, is renowned for its rich Muharram traditions, which set it apart from other cities — from its  alams and pirs to centuries-old Imambargahs. One of its most unique observances is the mehndi ritual held annually on Muharram 7, a ceremony steeped in reverence.
At the heart of these traditions stands Qadam Gah Maula Ali which embodies Hyderabad’s spiritual identity. This expansive landmark, which includes a mosque, is primarily known as ‘ziarat’, drawing visitors from across Pakistan and beyond.
Alam — a symbol of valour
Pirs and alams are powerful legacies from the Talpur era that shape Hyderabad’s identity even today. During Muharram, they become especially visible, adding a unique character to the city.
Alams are tall wooden structures raised at famous Imambargahs like Qadam Gah, as well as in many homes. The alam denotes a flag, typically carried by military leadesr in battles fought by Muslims during the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) era.
In Karbala, explained Salamat Feroz, Imam Hussain (AS) handed over this flag or alam to his step brother, Hazrat Abbas (RA), which is why he is known as Abbas Alamdar [flag bearer]. During the battle, Hazrat Abbas (RA) demonstrated exceptional valour and skills while fighting Yazid’s forces to fetch water for the Imam’s children and holding the alam as well. “He held the alam on his body somehow even after losing both of his arms,” said Feroz.
“So, these alams are seen today on the rooftops of houses and imambargahs in memory of Abbas Alamdar,” he added.

The structure of any tall alam rests on an iron frame prepared by caretakers, who perform various tasks to ensure its stability before it is finally raised. When the time comes, men — young and old — gather in fervent devotion, their chants of “Labbaik ya Hussain!” echoing through the air, as they pull the structure with synchronised strength, carefully maneuvering it to stand upright at a precise 90-degree angle.
In the days leading up to Muharram, these alams are respectfully lowered for cleaning and essential refurbishment, before they are raised on or before Muharram 1 amid recitation of nohas. This process, known as nahar, typically begins after Eidul Azha. “Nahar means lowering the alams for beautification, fresh coats of colour, new decorations, or the addition of artistic elements,” explained Salamat.
Some of these alams are incredibly tall. One of the tallest alams — 82ft long — is fixed at Imambargah Anjuman Safina-i-Hussaini. A few years ago, Nisar Bhatti, a carpenter, shared that he crafted two alams of 93ft and 82ft for the Imambargahs of Tando Agha and Aliabad, dating back to 1963.
Another celebrated alam stands in the Wadhan jo Pir area, famously known as Jhandi Wadhu jo Pir. It has intricately carved peacock motifs, exemplifying a decorative trend that has now become common.
All famous alams are raised upon the sighting of the Muharram moon, as the ritual dictates. Large crowds gather at every Imambargah to witness their raising. The historic Qadam Gah Maula Ali consistently attracts an impressive turnout during this ceremony. As the massive structures begin to rise, colourful bulbs and decorative lights attached to them burst into brilliance. Considering their massive size, crane-like machines are often used to raise them.
 


Maintaining or, in some cases, replacing these alams can be a demanding task, reserved for craftsmen who possess the necessary dexterity and experience. This specialised work has its own jargon among those who perform it, passed down through generations. Typically, an alam is fixed into a beautifully ornate, onion-shaped concrete structure called a dikki, which serves both as a foundation and as a work of art. Decorative items such as carved images of pigeons, peacocks, and flower petals embellish the wooden elements of the alam, making the entire display visually captivating for onlookers.
Then there is a circular wooden structure used in the alam, known as the chauk, which is connected to a wooden piece called the dilli in the alam-making jargon. The dilli holds the shama daan. Finally, the kals — made of pipe or wood — carries a human palm, symbolising Hazrat Ghazi Abbas (RA), who was martyred on the 8th of Muharram during the battle of Karbala.
“I believe Qadam Gah’s history dates back to around 1810, and so does its alam’s,” said Kazim Mirza, one of the longest serving custodians of Qadam Gah. “There is an old sketch made by a foreigner in which an alam can be seen at the facade of the Fort (now Pucca Qilla). That very alam was fixed in Qadam Gah during the Talpur era,” he added.
Qadam Gah is located off Station Road and has recently undergone refurbishment with Iranian-style architecture. The building’s facade resembles the mausoleum of Hazrat Ali in Najaf Ashraf. A prayer mat made of stone is also kept there.
The prayer mat bears the imprints of Hazrat Ali’s forehead, hands, knees, and feet in the position of prostration. “This stone prayer mat was gifted by Iran’s ruler, Fatah Shah Kachar, to Mir Karam Ali Talpur, the then ruler of Sindh,” said Mirza. Kazim belongs to the Mirza family, whose ancestors migrated from Georgia and settled in Sindh in the early 19th century.
Shehnai tunes stir devotion
No pir is considered complete without the use of the shehnai, a small wooden musical instrument. Different tunes played on the shehnai express the sorrow, grief, and pain endured by Imam Hussain and his 72 companions. These tunes mark the mersias and nohas (elegies).
On Muharram, the Jamaityan jo Pir is taken out from the Imambargah, and the procession begins with the arrival of mourners. Its first big stopover is at Faqir ka Pir, where devotees from Hyderabad and beyond gather in large numbers. This pir is among the most significant highlights of Hyderabad’s Muharram commemorations. Throughout the journey, which lasts nearly 30 hours, the mourners make several stops at various locations. The procession concludes on Muharram 8 back at the same Imambargah. Over two dozen zuljanahs (horses) are a part of this.
 

Mourners hold zuljinah during proceedings of pir at Faqir Ka Pir. This pir is staged on Muharram 7 and is known as Jamaiytan jo Pir which is taken out from Tando Mir Mahmood.

According to Dr Imam Ali Mirza, who completed his PhD on Sindhi mersias, “The shehnai travelled from Iran to India and then to Sindh. It is also called nafeer in Persian.” He points out that there is evidence suggesting that, like the naqara, the nafeer was used in Karbala.
“Talpur rulers actively promoted azadari in various ways. Even after their release from Calcutta, they continued to donate money among the people for purposes of nazar-o-niaz,” said Mirza. He further explained that when the Urdu-speaking community migrated from India to Pakistan’s Hyderabad, they introduced their own cultural traditions of Muharram observance. “Their azadari practices remain distinct from those of the local community,” said Imam Mirza, author of Sindh aur Ahl-e-Bait and Sindh ki Azadari.
Kazim endorsed Imam’s view, saying that ashara-e-majalis were uncommon in Sindh before Partition. “Our elders used to organise majalis in different areas during Muharram, but after these communities migrated from India, they started holding 10-day majalis at a single location — a tradition that continues to this day at places like Qadam Gah or Mehfil-e-Hussaini,” said Kazim. He noted that while Allama Samar Zaidi from Lucknow had been visiting Tando Thoro in Hyderabad earlier, it was after migration that these 10-day majalis became an integral part of Muharram here.
 

Mourners perform matam in Jamaiytan jo Pir when it reaches Fakir ka Pir on the night of 7th-ith Muharram.

Hyderabad’s central Ashura procession is organised under the aegis of Anjuman-e-Hyderi, established in 1948. The Anjuman is currently headed by Nawaz Bhutto and Raza Irani. The procession starts from Qadam Gah and takes place at Karbala Dadan Shah.
Meanwhile, 10-day majalis are held on Station Road under the patronage of the Asna-Ashari Khoja community, who migrated from India. Their organisation was founded in a small location in Resham Gali in 1948 and has operated from a three-floor building off Station Road since 1967.
Over centuries, these rituals and traditions have been passed down generations, ensuring that the spirit of sacrifice and valour displayed in Karbala remains etched in the minds of Hyderabad’s residents.

Chopra, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and silver at the 2024 Paris Games, triumphed with a throw of 86.18 metres at the 12-athlete javelin Neeraj Chopra Classic event.
He finished ahead of former world champion Julius Yego (silver) and Sri Lanka’s Rumesh Pathirage (bronze).
“The biggest target of the competition was to uplift the Indian athletes alongside the international ones. We got the best javelin throwers to this competition,” Chopra told reporters after winning the competition.
The event drew more than 14,500 spectators — a figure that delighted Chopra, who has long championed greater public support for track and field events.
“We really wanted people to come and watch track and field,” said Chopra, who has single-handedly raised interest for athletics in India and has more than nine million Instagram followers.
“I always request people to come to the stadiums to cheer athletes as they work really hard.
“Track and field is one of the hardest sporting events. I request people to come and watch nationals as well… because our sport can only grow when people will come and watch us.”
The event featured three rounds with six attempts per participant, narrowing the field to eight after the initial round of three throws.
Among the five Indian competitors, three advanced to the second round, including Chopra, outperforming international athletes such as former Olympic champion Thomas Rohler and the Czech Republic’s Martin Konecny.
“We have been doing really well in the sport. They (Indian athletes) were quite happy to get a platform to play alongside the world champions,” the 27-year-old said.
“We also plan to add more events to this competition going forward, which will help the Indian athletes more.”
Among the Indian athletes, apart from Chopra, Asian Athletics Championships silver medallist Sachin Yadav performed well, recording his best throw of 82.33m in the third attempt.
“Sachin could have performed better, but he twisted his ankle in his opening throw. Overall, it was good. They will hopefully do well in the future. They are juniors and have time on their hand so will surely do better,” Chopra said.</p><small>2025-07-06 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6869c1e60ece6.jpg?r=124856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922423/the-imambargahs-that-shaped-karachis-soul' target='_blank'><strong>THE IMAMBARGAHS THAT SHAPED KARACHI'S SOUL</strong></a><br><p>“In the dead of a Karachi night, a shivering mourner, Afsar Hussain Rizvi, stood at my door, pressing 125 rupees into my hand for the masjid and Imambargah Darbar-i-Husaini, Husainabad, Malir [1954]. When I questioned his urgency, his voice, raw with desperation, pierced the silence: ‘I have no food in my house, and I needed to deposit this money now. I was terrified I would succumb to my children’s cries — their hunger is beyond my endurance.’” — Dr Aqeel Abbas Jaffery in Karachi Ki Azadaari — Ibtidaai Nuqoosh: 1950 Tak
“We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.” — Winston Churchill 
Every year on the 29th of Zilhaj, a powerful transformation sweeps across Karachi’s imambargahs. Vibrant flags give way to sombre black, publicly signalling the solemn start of Muharram, the month of mourning for Imam Hussain (AS).
This deeply symbolic act ignites a city-wide flurry of activity — from setting up of sabeels [water stalls] to final touches on meticulously pre-planned majalis [religious gatherings] and shab-bedaari [night-long vigils].  Sir Winston Churchill’s profound insight into the symbiotic relationship between human agency and the built environment finds its ultimate expression.
Karachi’s 200-plus significant imambargahs transcend mere structures. Deeply woven into the city’s soul, these spiritual anchors, founded by passionate individuals, are a powerful testament to how the fusion of history, faith and culture narrates incredible stories of human fortitude. The following are snapshots of some of the earliest landmarks.

From humble pre-Partition origins, and born out of unwavering devotion, Karachi’s earliest imambargahs organically evolved into dynamic spiritual anchors that have defined the city’s cultural fabric over the decades. On the occasion of Ashura, Eos sheds light on some of Karachi’s most iconic Shia landmarks…

IMAMBARGAH SIRAJ,
LYARI (CIRCA 1775)
Dr Aqeel Abbas Jaffery, in his seminal work Karachi Ki Azaadari — Ibtidaai Nuqoosh: 1950 Tak, unearths a compelling truth: the city’s oldest imambargah, dating back approximately 250 years, stands near Sarafa Bazaar in Kharadar, Lyari. Originally named Imambargah Siraz — a name echoed on its Sindhi script plate as “Imam Warah Siraz” — it paid homage to the indigenous Sindhi Shias, known as Siraji, who inhabited Moosa Lane.
Their distinct tradition of lamentation is characterised by slow, low-tempo chest-thumping. It is widely inferred that this venerable institution later evolved its name to Imambargah Shiraz, a graceful concession to the renowned city of Shiraz, Iran. Concurrently, the adjacent neighbourhood, once intimately known as Siraz Jo Parro, has been transformed into what is now recognised as Siraj Colony.
GHAREEBUL GHURBA IMAMBARGAH,
NAYA ABAD (1830)
Behind Bishu Imambargah, in a narrow street in Naya Abad, lies the Ghareebul Ghurba Imambargah. Established in 1830 by a remarkable woman named Fatima, affectionately known as “Phappan”, a member of the Khoja Shia Asna Ashri Jamaat. This sacred site holds a rich history, deeply intertwined with the stone-crafting profession. It was originally known in the local Sindhi lexicon as Phappan Ka Pirr, a term where “pirr” signifies a revered space.
Over time, Phappan Ka Pirr evolved into its current, more formal name: Ghareebul Ghurba Imambargah. Yet, the echoes of its founder and the skilled hands that shaped its stone walls continue to resonate, reminding visitors of its humble beginnings and profound significance.
BISHU IMAMBARGAH, NAYA ABAD (1835)

Another documented presence of Shia communal life in colonial times centres around the Bishu Imambargah in Naya Abad, a historic quarter of Karachi. Established in 1835, it predates many other well-known landmarks, including the Barra Imambargah in Kharadar. The Bishu Imambargah was founded in Baghdadi by a trader named Bishu.
Initially a single room, it was later expanded to a double-storey structure with stone walls. For almost two centuries, it has served as a pivotal hub for religious gatherings, mourning rituals for Imam Hussain, and a focal point for communal life for Karachi’s Shia community.

IMAMBARGAH BARAH IMAM,
BHIM PURA (FROM 1836)
Dedicated to the 12 spiritual leaders of Shia theology, Imambargah Barah Imam, located in Bhim Pura on Nishtar Road, is a composite of five (another tradition recounts 12) smaller imambargahs and was constructed in 1836 by devout follower Chaudhary Allah Ditta. This historic site famously hosted Allama Aqeel Turabi as a prominent zaakir [religious speaker] for many years. During Muharram and Youm-i-Ali (the death anniversary of Imam Ali (AS), Ramazan 21), processions from this imambargah traditionally traverse Napier Road before merging with the main juloos [procession] at Denso Hall.
BARRA IMAMBARGAH, KHARADAR (1868)
 

Photographs by Tahir Jamal

Built in 1868, Kharadar’s Barra Imambargah stands as a pre-Partition landmark, a central hub for deeply poetic annual rituals. According to Yousuf Ali Ghadir, whose forefathers migrated from Bushehr, Iran, the imambargah observes “alam nehar kar dena” on the 27th of Zilhaj, meticulously lowering revered alams [sacred flags]. Just two days later, on the 29th of Zilhaj, the community gathers for “alam kushai”, the ceremonial raising of these alams for ziarat. The air fills with Sache Bhai’s ‘Ooncha rahe apna alam’ [May our flag fly high], as one main alam is hoisted. Simultaneously, an alam dedicated to Hazrat Abbas (AS) rises to the heart-wrenching ‘Abbas, tere khoon se rangeen hai alam tera’ [Abbas, your flag is coloured by your blood].
These poignant moments mark the official start of majalis at Barra Imambargah. This tradition beautifully fuses Sindhi and Irani cultures, centralising traditional drumming. The Sindhi naqqara [drum] symbolises local heritage, while the majestic senj-o-dammam echoes deep Irani influence. Originating from Bushehr, senj refers to cymbals and dammam to drums.
IMAMBARGAH HUSSAINIA IRANIAN,
KHARADAR (1948)
 

Photographs by Tahir Jamal

In Kharadar, the  Imambargah Hussainia Iranian stands as a pivotal religious site. Originally a pre-Partition community centre owned by a Hindu or Sikh family, it was acquired post-Partition by an organisation of immigrant Iranians. A significant transformation occurred in 1960, when a nearby Khoja Asna Ashri mosque was renovated and its sacred taburukaat [artefacts] moved to what was then formally designated Hussainia Anjuman-i-Iranian, solidifying its role as an imambargah.

Another compelling narrative recalls the fervour of the first Muharram in newly independent Pakistan, just three months after its birth. Destitute muhajireen [refugees] from India commemorated the month with profound devotion. It’s said the 10th Muharram procession, traditionally ending at Barra Imambargah Kharadar, spontaneously diverted to Hussainia Iranian. Local Iranian bakery owners promptly distributed fresh buns as taburak [blessings] to the immense gathering of mourners.
The imambargah’s renown was further amplified by Allama Rasheed Turabi. Upon his 1949 migration to Pakistan, this revered Islamic scholar began delivering powerful majalis within its walls, heard by both Shia and Sunni communities across the city.

IMAMBARGAH
MEHFIL-I-SHAH-I-KHORASAN, SOLDIER BAZAAR (1948)
Established in 1948, just a year after Pakistan’s independence, the Imambargah Mehfil-i-Shah-i-Khorasan in Soldier Bazaar became renowned for hosting significant Muharram majalis. Its inception addressed the immediate post-Partition needs of prominent Shia families, the Habib and Gokal groups, who settled in Catholic Colony Number 1.
Their initial Muharram observance in a makeshift tent sparked a vision for a permanent imambargah. The community responded fervently, with Qasim Ali Gokal’s house donated for ziarat [visitation]. Crucially, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah himself allotted the land for both a mosque and the imambargah.
Masterfully designed by Muhammad Ali Habib, both structures arose within 18 months. Khoja Shia Asna Ashri women named it, echoing pre-Partition Bombay traditions. Subsequently, Nishtar Park, conveniently located near Mehfil-i-Shah-i-Khorasan, replaced Jahangir Park as the central assembly point for religious and political gatherings.
QAIMIA IMAMBARGAH,
MALIR (1948)
As narrated in Professor Syed Imran Zafar’s Karachi Ki Aazadari (Volume 1), in 1947, Syed Abu Jafar Zaidi, a railway employee and mohajir from India’s Awadh region, arrived in Karachi, carrying little but the unwavering flame of his faith. After a cramped start in Kharadar, Zaidi and his family settled in a vacant building (known as Seth Daulat Ram’s haveli) in the Malir Mandir area in 1948.
Zaidi arrived from India with sacred relics for his home-imambargah, seeking fellow mourners in an unfamiliar land. The first majlis [religious gathering] was held in the abandoned Daulat Ram building and this led to the formal establishment of Qaimia Imambargah in 1948, named after his ancestral one in Safipur.
The path was arduous. Zaidi’s property claim was rejected, and the building itself became contested. But his devotion was legendary; his family even saved their sugar ration and consumed jaggery all year to be able to offer tea to mourners during Muharram. This is the enduring human story of Qaimia Imambargah: a relentless testament to faith, born from displacement, forged in sacrifice, and sustained by an unwavering community.
IMAMBARGAH SHAH WILAYAT, GOLIMAR (1960)
The azadari in Karachi’s Ali Basti in Golimar pulses with centuries of history, originating from Aligarh and Jalali (UP) in India — hubs of Muslim resurgence and Shia devotion. After Pakistan’s creation in 1947, a considerable number of Syeds and devout Jalali residents arrived in Karachi as destitute migrants, finding solace in makeshift camps. By 1950, as Karachi expanded, many settled in Ali Basti. With Muharram’s arrival, the community swiftly established spaces of faith. A mosque (Masjid-i-Haideri) rose in 1950, later managed by the Haideri Trust. Simultaneously, the Hussainia Imambargah, also known as Jalali walon ka imambargah [the imambargah of the Jalalis], was founded.
Syed Istijab Hassan Naqvi, an Amroha migrant, established Imambargah Shah Wilayat in 1960, hosting its first Muharram majalis despite initial hardships. Today, with redeveloped sections and installed zarih [shrine replicas], Imambargah Shah Wilayat remains a vibrant azadari hub, echoing centuries-old devotion that found its resilient home in Karachi.
It is traditionally held that the iconic noha [religious lament] ‘Ya Abbas, har dil ne pukara ya Abbas’ from Anjuman-i-Haidery Ali Basti, began with a couplet by Hussain Qaiser Rizvi (Ali bhai) in 1969-70. His relative Waheedul Hassan Hashmi completed it, and Ali bhai began reciting it. In 1973-74, Naseem Amrohvi further enriched this powerful lament with additional couplets.
IMAMBARGAH JAFFAR-I-TAYYAR, MALIR (1960)
 


In Malir’s Jaffar-i-Tayyar Society, the vibrant history of azadari [mourning] predates the locality itself, a testament to unwavering communal resolve. The narrative began in 1960, with the establishment of the adjacent F-South locality, sparking a critical need for a dedicated mosque and imambargah. By 1963, a 2,000-square-foot adjacent plot was allotted for the purpose.
Yet, construction faced trials. Walls were repeatedly erected only to be mysteriously razed each night. To counter this, a dedicated team of 12 volunteers, headed by Ali Hasan Zaidi (also known as Darogha Ji) instituted nightly vigils, their charpoys placed directly within the nascent imambargah, ensuring its survival.
 


Today, Jaffar-i-Tayyar’s Muharram programmes are a meticulously orchestrated display of profound devotion. The entire locality transforms: black flags adorn every corner, azakhanas [places for azadari] are readied, and the central road becomes a vibrant sea of sabeels, offering refreshments and stalls brimming with Islamic literature.
 


SHAH-I-KARBALA TRUST (RIZVIA) IMAMBARGAH, RIZVIA SOCIETY (1960)
 


In 1948, Maulana Aneesul Hasnain, a dedicated schoolteacher, and Advocate Qazalbash envisioned a new settlement. Their goal: to create decent dwellings for those building new lives in a nascent nation. Most initial residents of their new settlement were migrants from India’s historic Awadh region, particularly Lucknow. These families, carrying centuries-old religious traditions, found fertile ground for expression in their new 56-acre habitat.
Pakistan’s very first 8th Rabi-ul-Awwal procession emerged from what was by then known as Rizvia Colony. It was Musseab Ali Zaidi, a visionary and devout individual, who initiated this profound tradition that continues to wind through the streets of Rizvia Society to this day. The community’s spiritual heart quickly emerged with the construction of the central mosque, reverently known as Shah-i-Karbala Masjid. Its foundation was laid in 1960-1961 on a 6,000-square-yard plot, and it was completed by 1964. The Shah-i-Karbala Trust was officially registered on January 3, 1962. The prime anjuman [association] here is Anjuman-i-Ghum Khawaraan-i-Abbas, and their signature noha is ‘Kartay hain maatam haram Abbas ka….ho gaya marna sitam Abbas ka.’

THE UNSUNG ARCHITECTS OF KARACHI’S CULTURAL LANDSCAPE
Far beyond a handful of prominent landmarks, Karachi’s imambargahs are living chronicles of faith, culture and history. They’re the powerful crucible where human agency, brick, mortar and steel converge to forge incredible stories of courage and enduring spirit.
Carved in stone and spirit, these institutions reveal how resilient, often displaced, communities meticulously recreated their heritage, fundamentally negotiating the city’s soul. They stand as powerful proof of endurance against immense odds, demanding urgent, academically robust documentation to make it a part of urban planning and decision making.

It is a rich tradition that has been going on for centuries.
That is also why those youngsters seen whiling away their time in the streets, playing cricket or football, are seen stacking two or three bricks or gathering pieces of wood by the roadside for putting together makeshift stoves.
Hands known for hitting powerful shots, sixes and fours that broke so many windows in the neighbourhood prove helpful otherwise. They chop onions, wash wheat and lentils, clean meat and stand for hours stirring the contents of the cauldrons on the 9th and 10th of Muharram.
 
 

Haleem cooks the entire night. It is a slow-cooked stew. Therefore, preparations for cooking it take time. No problem. No one minds. If one set of hands gets tired of the stirring, another takes over. They may take turns, but no one backs out.
You get to witness such sights all over town — in lanes and streets, by the roadsides, footpaths and on roundabouts. They are especially present in areas from where the Muharram procession will pass. And the Haleem had better be ready by then.
Of course, all Haleem is not just cooked outdoors. It is also cooked in homes. But all the Haleem on these two days is cooked for Niaz distribution.
Haleem cooked together is also shared with the people in mourning throughout this period, especially on Ashura, and also with friends, relatives and the less fortunate.
It symbolises charity, unity and respect, as most of the people cooking the traditional dish are Sunnis, who offer it to their Shia brothers and sisters, who are busy with their religious obligations during this time.

Chanting of red-robed monks and nuns rang out from Himalayan hilltop forested temples in India, home to the Dalai Lama since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.
“I am just a simple Buddhist monk; I don’t normally engage in birthday celebrations,” the Dalai Lama said in a message, thanking those marking it with him for using the opportunity “to cultivate peace of mind and compassion”.
Dressed in traditional robes and a flowing yellow wrap, he walked with the aid of two monks while flashing his trademark beaming smile to thousands of followers.
 






Beijing condemns the Nobel Peace Prize winner — who has led a lifelong campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau — as a rebel and separatist.
Alongside the celebrations, however, is the worry for Tibetans in exile that China will name its successor to bolster control over the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.
That raises the likelihood of rival challengers to the post; one by self-declared atheist Beijing, the other by the Dalai Lama’s office based in neighbouring India, a regional rival of China.
‘Good heart’
The celebrations on Sunday are the culmination of days of long-life prayers for Tenzin Gyatso, who followers believe is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a man whose moral teachings and idiosyncratic humour have made him one of the world’s most popular religious leaders.
“While it is important to work for material development, it is vital to focus on achieving peace of mind through cultivating a good heart and by being compassionate, not just toward near and dear ones, but toward everyone,” he said in his birthday message.
“Through this, you will contribute to making the world a better place.”
 
 

The celebrations also included his key announcement that, after being inundated with messages of support from fellow Tibetans both inside and in exile, the spiritual institution would continue after his death.
He said he had received appeals from followers from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China.
The seemingly esoteric matters of reincarnation have real-world political consequences, with Tibetans fearing his death will mark a major setback in his push for more autonomy for the Himalayan region.
The Dalai Lama said his India-based office alone would “exclusively” identify that successor — prompting a swift and sharp reply from China that the reincarnation “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing.
China said the succession would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.
That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered effusive birthday greetings on Sunday, calling the Dalai Lama an “enduring symbol of love”.
 






India and China are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, but have sought to repair ties after a 2020 border clash.
‘Freedom and dignity’
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in a statement that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.
Among the crowds attending the celebrations was Hollywood star Richard Gere, a longtime backer of the Tibetans in exile, who on Sunday said the Dalai Lama “totally embodies selflessness, complete love and compassion and wisdom”.
 
 

Messages of support were also given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Barack Obama, who said the Dalai Lama had shown what it means to “speak up for freedom and dignity”.
The ceremony ended with the Dalai Lama eating a slice of cake and thousands singing “happy birthday”.
No details have been released for the future succession.
All so far have been men or boys, often identified as toddlers and taking up the role only as teenagers.
The current Dalai Lama, himself identified in 1937, has said that if there is a successor it will come from the “free world” outside China’s control.
In a speech to followers on Sunday, the Dalai Lama said his practice of Buddhism meant he had dedicated his life towards seeking compassion.
“I’m now 90 and… when I reflect on my life, I see that I have not wasted my life at all”, he said, speaking in Tibetan.
“I would not have regrets at the time of my death; rather I would be able to die very peacefully.”</p><small>2025-07-06 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06113501e019c75.jpg?r=113507' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922333/karachi-to-remain-cloudy-and-humid-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to remain cloudy and humid: Met Office</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The city is expected to continue with largely cloudy and humid weather conditions that may lead to drizzle during the night or morning over the next few days, the Met department stated on Saturday.
The department’s data showed that Karachi has the “most pleasant” weather in the province these days, with a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius recorded on Saturday. Relative humidity was recorded at 70 per cent.
Intense heat prevailed over northern and central areas, with Dadu seeing the highest temperature (44°C), followed by Khairpur (43°C), Sukkur, Mohenjo Daro and Rohri (42.5°C), Larkana (42°C), Shaheed Benazirabad (41°C), Sakrand (40°C), Mithi (36°C) and Hyderabad (38°C).
Thatta, with 39.5°C, saw a deviation of 5.1°C from its monthly average temperature for July.
“Right now, there is no possibility of significant heavy rains in Sindh over the next 10 days. However, during this period, light rain/drizzle may occur in Tharparkar, Umerkot, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta, Ghotki, Larkana, Shikarpur, Jamshoro districts and the Karachi division,” said Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder Laghari.
According to him, different weather conditions are currently prevailing across the country. “While the cities from Rahim Yar Khan to Lahore are seeing good rains these days, drought conditions prevail in the northern areas, resulting in fast-paced glacier melting.
 
 

“At least for the past two to three years, weather conditions in the northern areas have dramatically changed; snowfall has greatly reduced and the duration of warmer days has increased. This has seriously affected the farming sector in those areas.”

Two FIRs have been registered against hospital officials and lab technicians for what the CM described as “criminal negligence” during a briefing on investigation findings. A third FIR was filed against the hospital’s parking stand contractor and staff for allegedly overcharging token fees and threatening patients. All nine suspects were presented before the local duty magistrate Mr. Gulzar who gave two-day physical remand.
Pakpattan District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chadhar told Dawn that all suspects were handcuffed and transferred to city police station lock-up. The medical superintendent and the health CEO were transported in their official vehicles under police custody.
City Station House Officer (SHO) Mr. Hashim said the FIRs were registered early in the morning on the basis of written complaints by the victims’ families.

Health CEO, MS among nine suspects remanded in police custody for two days

The first case, FIR No. 738/25, under Sections 322 (causing death by negligence) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), names health CEO Dr. Sohail Asger, MS Dr. Adnan Ghaffar, Medical Officer Dr. Ahsan, lab technicians Muhammad Tufail, Muhammad Murtaza, and Mumtaz.
The complainant, Ali Hyder of Mohalla Gulzarabad, said his newborn daughter Minhaj Fatima died due to lack of oxygen and proper treatment. He claimed that after raising concerns with the CEO, no action was taken. He also alleged the records of deceased children were deliberately removed. The FIR includes names of 15 grieving parents citing negligence and oxygen shortages.
The second case, FIR No. 739/25, was lodged by Muhammad Waseem of Chak 93/E under Sections 382 (theft with preparation for harm), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 148/149 (unlawful assembly). It accuses lab technicians Muhammad Tufail, Muhammad Murtaza, Mumtaz, of DHQ Hospital, along with Shahid Iqbal, Javed of Shafqat Lab, Irfan of Janoom Lab and Faisal of Alshifa Lab. The complainant alleged that these individuals were illicitly selling hospital oxygen to privately run facilities in which they had financial stakes. Waseem claimed he was threatened after exposing the theft on June 19.
The third case, FIR No. 737/25, was filed against parking stand officials under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 506, and 384 (extortion) on the complaint of Muhammad Ashraf. Those named include contractor Rana Nasir, Ali Raza, Rao Naveed, Shahzeb and two unidentified staff members. The complainant alleged that when he objected to excessive parking fees, he was held hostage by armed personnel and later released.
The DPO confirmed that all nine suspects were presented before the local duty magistrate Mr. Gulzar who remanded them in police custody for two days.

In an X post, Bilawal had used the word ‘Sindhu’ for the River Indus, warning that “an attack” on its flow (by India) would not be tolerated. Mr Chaudhry commented that Bilawal should not have used the word ‘Sindhu’. He wrote: “This is an attack on Pakistan, not on Sindh, unless you have also joined Sindhu Desh.”
 






This was a rather uninformed comment by Chaudhry. Bilawal was livid. He responded by posting that Sindhu is the ancient name of the Indus. He is right. Many folks outside Sindh aren’t aware of this. This is not something that is taught in Pakistani textbooks. So, whenever they hear the word ‘Sindhu’, the first thing that comes to their mind is ‘Sindhu Desh’, a term coined for an independent Sindh by the Sindhi scholar G.M. Syed.
The River Indus originates from a mountain spring in Tibet. Fed by glaciers, it flows through the Ladakh region into Pakistan. The majority of its journey towards the Arabian Sea unfolds within Pakistan’s borders. It is the country’s largest river and is often referred to as ‘Pakistan’s national river.’

Like most fed only on Pakistani textbooks, the former minister of information Fawad Chaudhry is woefully ignorant about the etymology of the word ‘Sindhu’ that he took offence to. It is, in fact, one of the oldest names for the River Indus and very much in continuous usage

About 5,000 years ago, a major civilisation emerged on the banks of the river. Archaeologists call it the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC). It extended from northeast Afghanistan, to what today is Pakistan and northwest India.
No one’s sure what the river was called during the IVC period — even though, according to the American linguist Franklin Southworth, it was likely called ‘cintu’. However, the word ‘Sindhu’ first appeared in the oldest Vedic text, Rigveda (second millennium BCE). It is a Sanskrit word and Southworth suggests it may have been derived from ‘cintu’ by the people who dislodged and replaced the IVC population.
The ancient Persians pronounced ‘Sindhu’ as ‘Hindu’. Present-day Punjab and Sindh in Pakistan were part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550-330 BCE). The Persians referred to the people living in these regions as ‘Hindu’ or ‘people of the river.’
In the fifth century BCE, ancient Greeks encountered these people. The Greek rendering of the word ‘Hindu’ was ‘Indos’. They called the river ‘Indos’ and the region ‘Indoi’, or ‘the land/people of the Indos River.’
So, the word ‘Hindu’ is an ancient Persian word derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Sindhu’ referring to the river. ‘Indos’ was derived by ancient Greeks from the Persian word ‘Hindu’. It is from ‘Indos’ that we get the name ‘Indus’ (and India). None of this had anything to do with religion. There was no Hinduism as such at the time. The word ‘Hinduism’ is relatively new.
According to the historian Abraham Eraly, it was in the 16th century that non-Muslim populations of India began being referred to as ‘Hindu’, to distinguish them from the ruling Muslims. However, the word ‘Hinduism’ was only coined by British writers in the first decades of the 19th century. It referred to culminated traditions, texts and practices that date to the 2nd millennium BCE. But it wasn’t until the 19th century that the word ‘Hindu’ was given a monolithic religious context. Yet, there are still ‘Hindus’ who reject this word and claim to be followers of ancient ‘Vedic beliefs.’
The word Sindhu is still in use in India and Pakistan. For example, in Pakistan, Indus is also referred to as the ‘River Sindh’ (Darya-i-Sindh in Urdu). Again, the word ‘Sindh’ (in this regard) is obtained from the word Sindhu and not from ‘Sindh’ — the region that has a Sindhi-speaking majority. So where did the word Sindh come from?
Since a large part of the Indus runs across this region, the ancient Persians called it ‘Abisind’, the Greeks referred to it as ‘Sinthus’, the Romans called it ‘Sindus’, the Chinese ‘Sintow’ and the Arabs called it ‘Sind’. It is this eight century name that the Arabs gave to the region that has lasted to this day.
In 1843, British colonialists conquered Sindh and merged it with the ‘Bombay Presidency.’ This fostered a sense of deprivation among the Sindhis. For the next nine decades, Sindhi intellectuals and politicians worked to establish the status of Sindh as a province. In 1936, they succeeded. In 1947, Sindh voted to become part of the newly created Pakistan.
 


However, the sense of deprivation among the Sindhi-speakers returned when Sindh’s capital Karachi was put under federal control. Also, after the country’s creation, millions of Urdu-speaking Muslim migrants (mohajirs) from India settled in Sindh, leading to a significant demographic shift. This altered the ethnic composition of the province, especially in Karachi and Hyderabad.
New grievances rekindled the Sindhi nationalism that had emerged during British rule to establish Sindh as a province. In Pakistan, it was largely an intellectual project, led by the likes of G.M. Syed, Ibrahim Joyo and Sheikh Ayaz. In the 1960s, they formulated a ‘history’ of the Sindhi people which, according to the academic Dr Asma Faiz, “expressed the political and ideological aspirations of a community in search of its lost glory, hearkening back to a past that included a period of territorial and political autonomy before the onset of colonialism.”
Sindhi nationalism then took a more militant turn after the Bengali-majority East Pakistan broke away to become Bangladesh in 1971. A year later, Syed launched the Sindhu Desh movement, which aspired to separate Sindh from Pakistan. Ironically, at the time, a Sindhi, Z.A. Bhutto, rose to power. Bhutto and his PPP were staunch federalists, popular in Sindh as well as in Punjab. The Bhutto regime launched a scheme to neutralise Syed’s separatist politics. Bhutto co-opted Syed’s Sindhi nationalist narrative and put it in the context of Pakistani federalism.
In this, one can find the seeds of a federalist nationalism that posits that Pakistan is a continuation of civilisations that have been emerging on the banks of the Indus for 5,000 years. According to this narrative, Sindh is but just one part of this continuation, which otherwise includes all of Pakistan. This narrative has continued to erode the more aggressive conduits of Sindhi nationalism.
So, Mr Chaudhry should relax. Technically, being a Punjabi from Jhelum, he too is a part of civilisations which emerged in regions fed by River Indus, which also happened to be called Sindhu centuries before anything known as Sindhu Desh even existed.

According to reports, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Pakistan had no objection to handing over “individuals of concern” to India, provided New Delhi showed a willingness to cooperate.
In a hard-hitting statement on Saturday, PTI CIS Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the PPP chairman’s stance, calling him an “immature political child”. He said the proposal was ill-advised and detrimental to Pakistan’s national security narrative, adding that such statements humiliate the country on international platforms.
Mr Akram accused the “fraudulently imposed” government of bringing Pakistan to its knees.

Accuses PPP chairman of appeasing India, undermining national security

“We fail to understand why Bilawal is so keen on appeasing India,” he asked, alleging that the PPP chairman was proving time and again that he lacked political wisdom, vision and understanding of regional geopolitics.
“Instead of holding India accountable for its continued aggression, water terrorism and cross-border interference, Bilawal was proposing CBMs that compromise Pakistan’s sovereignty and integrity,” he said.
He emphasised that it was imperative to ask Mr Bhutto-Zardari on whose behalf he issued such a statement and what he intended to achieve by offering such concessions to a belligerent India by humiliating Pakistan on an international stage. Mr Akram also criticised the PPP chairman’s inconsistency.
 
 

“Bilawal has become a symbol of confusion and contradiction in Pakistan’s foreign policy discourse,” he said. “PPP was founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on the legacy of Kashmir, but today, Bilawal is betraying that legacy by pursuing political gains at the expense of Kashmiri blood.” Mr Akram went on to mock Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s political credentials, stating that leadership is earned, not built through media appearances and styling. “If PPP’s intelligentsia truly cares about Bilawal, they should let him contest local body elections first and appear on regional TV channels instead of being pushed on international media, where he only embarrasses Pakistan,” he stated.
He said the PPP chairman would lead the party to complete elimination, advising that if the party wanted to survive, he must step aside and hand over its leadership to Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “who, at the very least, shows more promise and sense than him”.

The world’s richest person — and Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election — had a bitter falling out with the president after leading the Republican’s effort to slash spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk has clashed with Trump over the president’s massive domestic spending plan, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.
Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.
“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
 






Musk cited a poll — uploaded on Friday, US Independence Day — in which he asked whether respondents “want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system” that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.
 






The yes-or-no survey earned more than 1.2 million responses.
“By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” he posted on Saturday.
Musk also shared a meme depicting a two-headed snake and the caption “End the Uniparty.”
 






‘Laser-focus’ on vulnerable lawmakers
It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.
The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.
 
 

Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery.”
He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.
“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said earlier this week.
After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill — which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law — Trump threatened to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.
“We’ll have to take a look,” the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.
On Friday, after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become “the deciding vote” on key legislation.
“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” Musk posted on X.
All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate’s 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.
Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote — as businessman Ross Perot’s independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush’s re-election bid, resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.
“You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don’t like it,” one X user wrote to Musk.</p><small>2025-07-06 04:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06083130117e37a.jpg?r=083208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922382/taxes-unnerve-e-commerce-platforms' target='_blank'><strong>Taxes unnerve e-commerce platforms</strong></a><br><p>• New regime includes 18pc GST, additional levies for non-filers, mandatory buyer data reporting by banks and intermediaries
• Online sellers and courier services waiting for clarity over the future of their businesses
ISLAMABAD: Confusion and fear prevail not only among local and international e-commerce platforms regarding the imposition of new taxation regimes with the advent of the 2025-26 fiscal year, but also among sellers and courier services, who are waiting for clarity over the future of their businesses.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has compiled a list of eight key e-commerce platforms that provide tangible and intangible items, including music, movies, and software.
The largest selling platform was Facebook, with transactions worth more than Rs12.31bn. Others include Apple/Tunes, Google, AliExpress, Netflix, Temu, and Spotify, while the largest transactions are held under the category of others.
The total amount of transactions by these international and local online platforms, such as Daraz, OLX, Zameen, and PakWheels, exceeds Rs317.78bn.
The government has added a new chapter to the income tax regime, and taxes have been imposed on sales tax and other levies.
 
 

The overall situation has led to confusion among leading local and international platforms regarding the tax collection mechanism.
Incidentally, international e-commerce platforms have requested that their local partners clarify the tax collection mechanism in Pakistan, effective July 1.
“Our client has tasked us with looking into the outcome and talking to various courier companies to determine the impact on rates and tax filing mechanism,” said a senior executive of a PR company.
Due to a lack of clarity over the situation, neither he nor any executive of Pakistani e-commerce platforms was willing to disclose their identity; however, one executive pointed out that even the upgraded Income Tax law 2025 had not been uploaded to the FBR website.
One of the key stakeholders, the Pakistan E-commerce Association (PEA), has announced a protest against the new taxation regime.
Its Chairman Omer Mubeen warned that the new tax measures would shrink profit margins and put an additional burden on customers.
He added that there are growing concerns over harsh eCommerce taxation policies; the PEA, along with other relevant stakeholders, including the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP), will continue to protest the move on social media and write letters to the concerned authorities.
While the new laws were facilitative for women businesspersons, confusion and a lack of knowledge have created panic among many.
The courier companies have also begun advising e-commerce businesses and individual sellers to complete their tax registrations to continue availing themselves of delivery services.
A local seller from Islamabad stated that e-commerce was still in its early stages in the country. Instead of supporting the industry, the government was making it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business.
Meanwhile, responding to the query, a senior official of the FBR said that the process would materialise after Ashura, which falls on Sunday, and most of the activities in this regard will commence from Monday.
He added that there were three main objectives of the new tax regime on e-commerce: registration of businesses, enhancement of tax collection, and streamlining the process for future regulations.
“There is a need for regulation of e-commerce too for the protection of buyers from frauds or deceptions by any unknown seller and that is not possible without registration of the businesses,” FBR official added.
Under the new regime, without proper registration, courier companies and online marketplaces will not be authorised to process or ship such orders.
Similar to physical retail outlets, an 18pc general sales tax (GST) has been imposed on all goods and services bought online, while additional taxes apply to non-filer purchasers and the platforms as well.
However, banks and online payment intermediaries will be required to maintain records of buyers for quarterly filing. The new tax regime also imposes penalties on intermediaries for failing to collect the due taxes or file the necessary documents with the FBR.

He said the grandson of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), along with his family and companions, sacrificed their lives for the “sake of truth, justice and religion but did not bow down to falsehood.”
“This great sacrifice of his reminds us that protecting principles and standing firm on the truth requires great courage and unwavering faith,” he said in a message on the occasion of Ashura.
He said the battle of Karbala taught us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the way that leads to Allah Almighty.

Strict security arrangements nationwide for majalis, processions

“Today, when our nation is facing many challenges — be it the economy, society or national unity — we need to take guidance from the life of Imam Hussain more than ever.”
He urged the nation to adopt Imam Hussain’s qualities of honesty, tolerance, patience and sacrifice in our national life.
On the day of Ashura, he urged the nation to pledge that they will make “truth and honesty our motto in our lives”.
“We will raise our voice against oppression and try to give our homeland the same peace, justice and dignity that is reflected in the bright character of Imam Hussain.”
Security arrangements
On Saturday, majalis and processions were held across the country in connection with 9th Muharram.
Strict security arrangements were made for around 2,763 processions and 7,598 majalis in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday.
 
 

In Islamabad, 61 majalis and 17 processions were held; in Punjab, 3,805 majalis and 1,677 processions were held; in Sindh, 1,207 majalis and 644 processions were held; in KP, 939 majalis and 261 processions were held; in Balochistan, 115 majalis and 11 processions were held; in GB, 1,290 majalis and 111 processions were held; and in AJK, 181 majalis and 42 processions were held.
Local law enforcement agencies monitored processions through drones and security cameras in 1,129 highly sensitive areas across the country.
Federal and provincial authorities have prepared security plans with zero tolerance for hate speech or sectarian provocations.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi emphasised that religious incitement on social media will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
He stressed that maintaining law and order is the top priority, and that law enforcement agencies are fully vigilant to foil the malicious designs of terrorists.

Asked about Hamas’s positive response to the latest ceasefire proposal, an Israeli official said “no decision has been made yet”.
It came ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s departure for talks on Monday in Washington, where US President Donald Trump has intensified calls for an end to the war.
 
 

Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said Saturday’s dead included eight people killed in two strikes on schools in Gaza City. He also reported that eight people were killed by Israeli fire near an aid distribution centre in southern Gaza.
On the other hand, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he asked US President Donald Trump to intervene to stop shootings at Gaza aid centres, which the UN says have killed more than 500 people.
Erdogan said when he met Trump at the Nato summit in June, he asked him to step in and halt the bloodshed.
“I asked him to intervene in the Gaza process telling him, ‘You are the one who will best manage this process with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’. There are people who are being killed in food queues in particular.
“You need to intervene here so that these people are not killed’,” he said, his remarks reported Saturday by Anadolu state news agency.
“Hamas has repeatedly demonstrated its good will in this regard,” Erdogan said just days after his spy chief and foreign minister met separately with senior Hamas officials.
US pressure on Israel would be “decisive” in securing the success of the latest proposal for a 60-day truce in Gaza, he remarked, saying the issue of guarantees was “especially important”.

• Democrats worry ‘big beautiful bill’ will slash health, welfare support
• New legislation poised to add $3.4tr to US deficit over 10 years
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump signed his flagship tax and spending bill into law, capping a grandiose White House Independence Day ceremony featuring a stealth bomber fly-by.
“America is winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said before signing the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” on Friday, flanked by Republican lawmakers who helped push it through Congress.
Trump also played down criticism by Democrats that the unpopular legislation will slash social welfare programmes, saying: “You won’t even notice it.”
With First Lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump watched from the White House balcony as two B-2 bombers — the same type that recently struck Iranian nuclear sites — roared overhead, accompanied by F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.
The 79-year-old’s victory lap came a day after Republicans fell into line and passed the sprawling mega-bill, allowing him to sign it as he had hoped on the Fourth of July holiday.
The bill honours many of Trump’s campaign promises: extending tax cuts from his first term, boosting military spending and providing massive new funding for Trump’s migrant deportation drive.
‘Never been anything like it’
The legislation’s signing caps two weeks of significant wins for Trump that have seen him tighten his grip on power and his party alike. The successes include the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire that was sealed after what he called the “flawless” US air strikes on Iran.
Pilots who carried out the bombing on Iran were among those invited to the White House event, which included a picnic for military families on the South Lawn.
“The last two weeks, there has never been anything like it, as far as winning,” said Trump.
Trump had however forced through the tax bill despite deep misgivings in the Republican Party that it would balloon the national debt. The legislation is expected to pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.
It squeezed past a final vote in the House of Representatives 218-214 after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson worked through the night to corral the final group of dissenters. Trump thanked Johnson at the White House event, saying: “What a job.”
Democrats and many voters have meanwhile expressed concerns that the “big beautiful bill” will slash health and welfare support.
The bill will force through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance programme for low-income Americans since its 1960s launch, while also shrinking federal food assistance programs.

Talking to journalists informally, the chief minister emphasised that he never contested the Feb 8 general elections as an independent candidate but rather as a PTI nominee. He said this would form the foundation of his legal challenge and vowed to go to any extent to secure PTI’s share of reserved seats in both the national and provincial assemblies.
The development come in the wake of the Constitutional Bench’s recent ruling on June 27, which effectively overturned the earlier Supreme Court verdict that had declared PTI eligible for the reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.
The CB decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, nullified the Supreme Court’s July 12, 2024 ruling by eight judges and transferred the reserved seats to rival parties.

Cites his own nomination as basis for contesting case in court

Mr Gandapur reiterated that while PTI-backed lawmakers are now technically considered independents under the new verdict, he is not among them. Citing his nomination papers that clearly identified him as a PTI candidate, he expressed determination to fight PTI’s case in court on that basis.
With the CB’s decision rendering PTI ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies, the number of opposition members in the KP Assembly is expected to jump from 27 to 52.
Presently, out of 27 opposition MPAs, nine each belong to the JUI-F and PML-N, five to PPP and two to each ANP and PTI-P. The strength of the opposition, however, will now include 19 from the JUI-F, 16 from PML-N, 11 from PPP and three each from ANP and PTI-P.
Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, with mostly elected as independents, while 25 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims were vacant due to the cases pending before the Supreme Court.
After the increase in their strength, the opposition members will be in a position to requisition assembly sessions. So far, they did not have sufficient numbers for the purpose. The Friday’s judgement restored several March 2024 notifications of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to declare 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
Apart from the provincial assembly, the eight MNAs elected on reserved seats for women from KP also stood restored. These MNAs include four from PML-N and two each from JUI-F and PPP. In addition to electoral matters, CM Gandapur discussed regional issues, reiterating his willingness to engage with the Afghan interim government to help resolve bilateral challenges, provided he is given the mandate. He strongly criticised the forced return of Afghan nationals, terming it a violation of human rights and international law. “We cannot humiliate Afghan nationals and will never force them to leave for their country.”
Mr Gandapur also argued that open borders and continued legal trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan would significantly contribute to reducing militancy in the region.

According to the Foreign Office, Pakistani delegation was led by Ambassador Muhammad Ayub, Additi­onal Foreign Secretary (Europe), while the Polish delegation was headed by Secretary of State at the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wadysaw Teofil Bartoszewski.
The Ambassador of Pak­is­tan to Poland, Muhammad Sami-ur-Rehman, and the Polish Ambassador to Pakistan, Maciej Pisarski, were also present during the consultations. The two sides reviewed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations.
 
 

The additional foreign secretary reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further broadening and deepening its ties with Poland in various fields, including trade, investment, energy, security and defence cooperation, science and technology, agriculture, migration and mobility and higher education. Regional and global issues of mutual interest, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe were also discussed in depth.
The two delegations found convergence on key issues and agreed to continue cooperation at multilateral forums, including the United Nations. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations will be held in Islamabad in 2026.

• Interior minister dismisses reports about president’s removal, says two parties, army ‘on same page’
• PPP leader claims party in no mood to join federal or Punjab cabinet
LAHORE: Two key federal ministers on Saturday dismissed speculations regarding the disintegration of the PML-N-PPP alliance, saying the two parties, and even the army were “on the same page”.
However, the enthusiasm regarding the coalition was a bit more diminished among PPP leaders who accepted having differences with the ruling party and also stressed the party has no desire to take ministries in the federal government.
While talking to the media in Lahore, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the PML-N’s total seats in the National Assembly have increased after the distribution of reserved seats in light of the Supreme Court’s order but the party was in no mood to shun PPP.
“The Bilawal-led party stood by the government during difficult times and we have instructions from Nawaz Sharif that in the times of stability, we must not abandon those who had supported us in challenging times.”
He said the PPP was a key ally of the federal government and would remain so. “We have an ideal working relationship. We [the PML-N] had formed the government with the help of the PPP,” he said while talking to reporters.
He acknowledged the critical support by PPP, without which the ruling coalition wouldn’t have come to power after the 2024 general elections.
‘No change in top office’
Also, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi during an interaction with the media in Sukkur said that there were no plans to remove President Asif Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.
He said the government, army, and the president were “fully aligned and on the same page”.
“Those who don’t want to see them united are spreading such rumours.”
Speculations about widening gap emerged as both parties, allies in the Centre, started jostling to strengthen their ranks by wooing disgruntled PTI leaders in Azad Jammu and Kashmir while the PTI leadership addressed pressers to declare that they would foil attempts to dislodge KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur amid political wrangling over reserved seats.
In AJK, the PML-N formally inducted a PTI defector into its parliamentary party, raising its strength in the 53-member Legislative Assembly to nine. Chaudhry Akmal Sargala, who was elected in 2021 from LA-37 (Jammu-IV), a Kashmiri refugees’ constituency in Punjab, announced his switch to PML-N on Friday.
Mr Sargala’s decision comes just days after the PPP pulled off a similar move, managing to break away four lawmakers elected on PTI tickets in 2021. These lawmakers included Ali Shan Soni, Shahida Sagheer, Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar and Javed Butt.
Following these inclusions, the strength of the PPP parliamentary party in AJK Assembly has risen to 17.
 
 

Earlier, speculations that the PPP might join the cabinet in Centre and Punjab started making rounds after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed, “There is a growing possibility of an arrangement between the PML-N and PPP that will allow both parties to jointly pursue a national agenda.”
When Deputy PM Dar was asked about the move, he told reporters in Lahore that the PPP had not demanded any ministries from the PML-N.
While PPP, over the past year, publicly shunned the idea of joining the federal and provincial cabinets, some of its leaders proposed taking the ministries as all the party has supported the PML-N on every other matter.
‘Take ministries or quit’
Senate chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, a PPP leader, also recently proposed to the party leadership that they either join the government or leave the coalition and go to the public.
Some party leaders believe that after 17 months of robust support for the PML-N in the Centre, the time has now arrived for the PPP to consider whether it should take ministries in both the federal and Punjab governments.
One issue where PPP leaders think the party went above and beyond its role as a “silent coalition partner” to support the government was in the aftermath of the conflict with India.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari travelled to different countries “playing the role of a foreign minister” to fight Pakistan’s case against India in the world, a PPP leader from Punjab told Dawn on Saturday.
The PPP called Foreign Minister Dar’s portfolio “ceremonious” and added that it would be better if his party joined the government and Mr Bhutto-Zardari became the foreign minister officially.
Amid this jostling, Mr Dar said the PML-N would work with all parties, including those in the opposition.
‘Wishful thinking’
However, he ruled out any meeting between PML-N president Nawaz Sharif and PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in the coming days, calling it “wishful thinking”.
“We don’t need to go to someone … However, [with regard to Imran Khan], the law will take its own course.
Meanwhile, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan said his party had been offered ministries by the PML-N in the Centre and Punjab, but it was not interested in joining the cabinets.
“The PML-N has offered cabinet positions to us, but the party is not interested in joining the cabinet as it has reservations on some issues,” said Mr Khan
He said the two parties have “different ideologies and stances” on various issues.

The alert said that heavy to very heavy rainfall from Sunday to Monday may trigger flash floods in local streams of Murree, Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan and Islamabad/Rawalpindi.
Flash flooding is also possible in the hill torrents of D.G. Khan, northeast Punjab, Kashmir and parts of Balochistan.
Officials warned that landslides and mudslides could cause road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir during the wet spell.

Chilas records its highest temperature since 1997, hitting 48.5 degrees Celsius

The department said heavy downpours may also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar.
 
 

An official said moist currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are entering the country and are likely to strengthen. “A westerly wave is also expected to affect upper part from Sunday evening,” he said.
“Mainly hot and very humid weather in most parts of the country with rain-wind/thundershower is expected at isolated places in Kashmir, upper/central Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, southeastern Sindh and north/southern Balochistan”
He added, “Heavy falls are also likely at few places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the period.”
On Saturday, heavy rain fell in Rawalpindi and Islamabad in the early hours. The maximum rainfall of 75 millimetres was recorded in Saidpur.
Separately, the Met Office reported that Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded a temperature of 48.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, its highest since 1997. The last record was set on July 17, 1997.
On the other hand, people in many parts of Balochistan braved a very hot day, as 48 degrees Celsius was recorded in Naukundi, 46 degrees in Dalbandin, and 45 degrees in Sibi.

“We sold about $450m to banks in June, highlighting our growing role in supporting the country’s exchange rate stability,” said Zafar Paracha, Secretary General of ECAP.
Exchange companies have welcomed the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) recent decision to include them in the Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI). For years, these companies have demanded similar incentives to those offered to banks, arguing that they also play a crucial role in channelling remittances.
“This incentive will certainly boost remittance inflows through exchange companies, and I believe FY26 could witness a new record,” Mr Paracha said. He estimated the total remittances handled by exchange firms during FY25 to be around $5bn, although he noted the figure is not yet officially confirmed.
The SBP issued a circular this week confirming the inclusion of exchange companies in the PRI framework. Under the new arrangement, exchange firms will receive Rs22 per dollar transaction, a substantial increase from the previous Rs2 they had been receiving for years.
Pakistan received $35bn in remittances during the first 11 months of FY25. With June inflows added, the total figure is expected to surpass the revised target of $38bn for the fiscal year.
Despite the significant contribution of remittances, the country’s export performance remained weak. Exports grew by only 6pc in FY25, far below the government’s ambitious goal of increasing exports to $60bn. Stronger remittance inflows have partly offset the shortfall.
Nonetheless, the government managed to maintain exchange rate stability for more than a year, encouraging exporters to release their holdings and helping importers plan over longer time horizons. Pakistan also secured rollover agreements worth approximately $16bn from friendly countries, including China, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, enabling the SBP to raise its foreign exchange reserves to $14.5bn by the end of FY25.
However, in recent weeks, the rupee has begun to slide against the US dollar despite healthy inflows in the currency market. Over FY25, the dollar appreciated by at least Rs5. On July 3, the interbank rate stood at Rs284.06 per dollar, while in the open market, the rate reached Rs286.40.
Globally, the US dollar has been under pressure, losing ground against major currencies, including the euro and the pound. Analysts note that increasing risks associated with the US dollar are prompting investors to diversify into other currencies and commodities like gold.

The country is currently experiencing high summer temperatures, with the PMD reporting in June that ‘Feels Like’ temperatures crossed 50 degrees Celsius in four cities.
According to today’s press release, both cities recorded extreme temperatures that shattered previous records.
The PMD recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5°C in Chilas today, breaking the previous historical extreme maximum record of 47.7°C on July 17, 1997.
Meanwhile, the temperature recorded in Bunji was 46.1°C. The previous historical extreme maximum record was 45.6°C on July 12, 1971.
“These persistent high temperatures over northern areas may accelerate snow and glacier melt, triggering Glof (glacial lake outburst flood) and flash floods incidents, in vulnerable valleys and surrounding regions during upcoming week,” the PMD warned, citing a warning issued on Friday.
Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in Gilgit Baltistan and KP are vulnerable, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
A day ago, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had warned the administrations of five districts about the high risk of Glofs due to a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system.
In an advisory issued to the deputy commissioners of Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan, the PDMA said that the PMD had formally informed it that as there was a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system in northern parts of the country, the risk of Glofs was very likely to increase in glaciated areas of the province.
The PDMA said that in view of the above weather conditions, officials were requested to take all necessary precautionary measures to avoid any loss of human and animal life and damage to infrastructure and crops.
It urged authorities to undertake proactive monitoring and surveillance of vulnerable Glof sites to ensure timely early warning and response, conduct evacuation drills in at-risk communities to ensure full preparedness and ensure that safe evacuation sites are fully stocked and ready for utilisation in case of any eventuality.</p><small>2025-07-05 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051623499739af8.jpg?r=162539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268/80pc-of-rescue-operation-complete-as-death-toll-from-lyari-building-collapse-rises-to-19' target='_blank'><strong>80pc of rescue operation complete as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 19</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey building collapse in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 19 as the recovery continued for a second day with eighty per cent of the operation completed.

The same figure was reported in an update by the Edhi Foundation and according to the data from the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute Of Trauma (SMBBIT) at Civil Hospital Karachi, seen by Dawn.com, which showed that 20 bodies were brought to the facility while one person died during treatment.
The data showed that 11 injured people were brought for treatment with 10 later discharged.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, said DIG Raza.
“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told Dawn.com.
“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.
 
 

Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told AFP at the scene.
“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.”
Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.
Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told AFP that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.
Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told AFP.
The incident came days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.
The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
 


The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.
But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.
“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said, speaking to AFP. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.
 
 

“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.
More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, DC Khoso told AFP.
‘Hinderances’ in rescue efforts
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.
Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.
The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
‘Sindh government answerable for last 17 years’
Sindh Assembly opposition leader and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA Ali Khurshidi blamed the Sindh government for Karachi’s administrative collapse and the Lyari building tragedy.
“Call the tanker mafia and you’ll get water in 30 minutes,” he said during a press conference, pointing out rampant corruption and institutional failure across civic bodies.
Khurshidi said if the provincial administration was to blame and held responsible if it had not passed laws in 17 years to make this a criminal offence.
“Instead of saying ‘this should be done,’ you should be admitting, ‘we should’ve done this, but we failed to.’”
Addressing President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, he said: “This is a question of your and your party’s credibility.”
He said the suspensions of officials would not work, insisting that termination and legal consequences were necessary. He condemned the “harassment” of Karachiites through traffic police extortion, pleading for urgent administrative reform, saying the public was fed up.
“This isn’t about point-scoring politics,” Khurshidi said. “We’re doing politics so we can solve genuine issues faced by people.” He concluded by calling on President Zardari and Bilawal to stop issuing mere condemnations and to instead fix the broken system under their party’s governance.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
 
 

The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-05 18:40</small></div><hr>
