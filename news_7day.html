“We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Quetta.
 






He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue.
Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province.
Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province.
“The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said.
The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations.
Imran had made a similar demand in September as well.

Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.
Four policemen were also wounded in the shootout, that lasted around four hours.
According to sources, Hakim was believed to be the mastermind of a failed suicide bombing targeting the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Karak has long been under the radar of the security and intelligence apparatus for ISKP network and recruitment.
It is one of the most underdeveloped districts in the province with one of the lowest socio-economic indicators, but it is known for its wild berry honey, much of which is exported to the Gulf and the Middle East. Incidentally, the ISKP network, was also associated with the honey trade.

Chasing 264, Pakistan won a tense first ODI by two wickets on Tuesday with only a couple of balls to spare on a pitch that assisted spinners in the later stages of both the innings.
Having elected to field first, the Shaheen Shah Afridi-captained hosts were facing a tough situation when Matthew Breetzke’s South Africa reached 98-0 as their openers dominated the proceedings. Later, the tourists were 191-3 in 33 overs before they suffered a late collapse as the home spinners took charge.
The pitch is likely to favour batsmen early on though spinners could again play a key role in the later stages of the match at the traditionally dry surface.
For South Africa, the focus will be on adapting quickly to the conditions and countering Pakistan’s bowling which has depth as well as variety.
The touring batsmen, in particular, will be looking to build partnerships and produce a better show with greater discipline against the likes of Shaheen, Naseem Shah, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and part-time spinner Saim Ayub, who earned the player-of-the-match award for his all-round show – 2-39 in eight overs and 39 runs – in the first game.
The South African players attended a training session at the Iqbal Stadium on Wednesday while the Pakistan team opted to rest.
The tourists participated in warm-up exercises followed by batting, bowling and fielding practice drills.
‘CREDIT TO BATTERS’
Earlier, talking at the post-match ceremony, Shaheen lauded the batters for their match-winning show in the series opener.
“Our bowlers came back in the last 10 overs to restrict South Africa to a reasonable total. But I will give credit to our batters who played well on a wicket that had both turn and swing [in the latter stages of the innings],” Shaheen said.
“They handled the situation well.”
Replying to a question regarding the tense victory in the series opener, the Pakistan skipper said, “That always happens in cricket but we’ll try to make it not happen again.”
Speaking at a news conference after the first ODI, Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan defended the hosts’ decision to bowl first.
“The decision to bowl first was taken by us while keeping in view the prevailing situation [at the ground]. It was a combined decision by us,” Rizwan told reporters while answering a question.
“Plus there was the dew factor. All of us had the same opinion that we should bowl first keeping in mind that dew will come into play in the latter stages of the day. The batting looked easy early on in the first innings but then came the dew factor.”
Responding to a question, Rizwan said that the hosts should have wrapped up the match earlier as Pakistan were well set at 196-3 in the 39th over with Rizwan (55) and Salman Ali Agha (62) at the crease.
“Yes, we [Salman and Rizwan] should have finished the game. Actually, the wicket was behaving awkwardly where the ball was skidding, gripping and bouncing and we were set.
“We will try not to repeat the mistakes and finish the game in future.”
Regarding the historic international match that the Iqbal Stadium hosted after 17 years, Rizwan said, “On our part, wherever we play at home — including Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi or Faisalabad — we get the same support from the crowd.
“It is what message the other [visiting] teams get from our crowds matters the most.”
Talking to reporters after the first match, South African pacer Corbin Bosch said that the wicket was good for spinners.
“It was a new ball wicket, and was tough [to bat on]. The ball [particularly in the latter stages] turned and spinners played a crucial role for both the teams,” Bosch told reporters.
The pacer believed that South Africa were slightly short of setting Pakistan a winning target, saying, “We were perhaps 15 runs short on this wicket”.

As he left the stage to a cheering cross-section of the metropolis, the song on the speaker was not one of the many well-worn tunes about New York but the beats from a Bollywood blockbuster, Dhoom.
Mamdani, winning a mandate with a left-wing agenda focused on making New York more affordable, has made history in many ways — as the first Muslim and first South Asian to lead America’s largest city, and, at 34, its youngest mayor in a century.
But Mamdani’s victory is a watershed not just for his identity but how he embraces it — fully.
“I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older, I am Muslim, I am a democratic socialist and — most damning of all — I refuse to apologise for any of this,” Mamdani told supporters inside a Brooklyn music venue.
 


South Asians constitute one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States, totalling more than five million people, and have made major inroads into politics — notably former vice president Kamala Harris, whose mother was from India.
But candidates have handled their identity in sharply different ways. Two once-prominent Indian Americans, Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, both Republican governors of conservative Southern states, took pains to describe how they had become Christians.
“The comfort level expressing and embracing outwardly your identity has varied from candidate to candidate over the years,” said Kishan Putta, an elected commissioner in Washington DC who serves on a Democratic Party advisory committee on Asian Americans.
Putta, who has followed South Asian candidates for years, also pointed to the victory in Virginia of Ghazala Hashmi as lieutenant governor, noting that the very first line on her website’s online biography is how she was the first Muslim and first South Asian American to serve in the Virginia Senate.
“So it’s not just candidates in cities or places with huge South Asian and immigrant communities,” Putta added. “Candidates are getting much more comfortable in talking about their identity.”

‘Symbolic moment of acceptance’
For Mamdani, like many South Asians, that identity is not always concise to explain. He was born in Uganda to two prominent Indian-born parents — the academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, who is Hindu.
Mamdani has spoken passionately about Islamophobia following the Sept 11, 2001 attacks, counts a kebab counter in diverse Jackson Heights as his favourite restaurant and days before the election campaigned car to car at LaGuardia Airport among taxi drivers, who are often South Asian.

Mamdani’s openness on his background “certainly is a break from what we have seen in the past”, said Sara Sadhwani, a political scientist at Pomona College who has studied South Asian Americans.
“But that very much goes along with Mamdani’s brand of authenticity and embracing difference — fully accepting the nuance of those differences,” she said.
“Even if all Indian Americans don’t completely embrace his politics, it is nonetheless a symbolic moment of acceptance of Indian Americans.”
 


Trump base attacks
US President Donald Trump has furiously attacked Mamdani but has earlier courted Indian Americans, making gains in last year’s election in a community that has historically voted Democratic and by some measures has the highest household income in the United States.
Trump’s stance is not shared by all his base, with online far-right campaigners in recent months writing hateful comments against Indian Americans.
Trump in September yanked up the fee for a visa used by Indian tech workers as part of a broader crackdown on immigration.
 
 

US Vice President JD Vance is married to an Indian American, Usha Vance, but recently raised eyebrows by saying he would be happy if she converts from Hinduism to Christianity. Vance accused critics of anti-Christian bias.
Vivek Ramaswamy, the pro-Trump Indian American tech entrepreneur running for governor of Ohio, said one lesson from Tuesday’s losses was: “Cut out the identity politics. It doesn’t suit Republicans.”
Dinesh D’Souza, a longtime Republican militant born in India, wrote on X: “A very loud group on the Right said, ‘Indians go home,’ and so many of them did — to the Democratic Party. “

— Justice Shahid Karim on the conferment of Hilal-e-Imtiaz on the late Justice Fazal Karim, 17 November 2023
A year ago today, Qazi Faez Isa departed as the chief justice of Pakistan.
His parting gift was to reverse the ruling on dissident votes in the parliament. This, we know, kicked the gates open to the 26th amendment, as once-unbothered lawmakers were promptly forced into voting for the judiciary’s funeral rites.
The bill was passed, and the third branch was destroyed.
But while obeying His Lordship’s decision, the unity regime felt free to disobey that of the other lordships in a different case — reserved seats. It was just enough defiance to secure the numbers for their amendment.
How, you ask, does the executive override the Supreme Court whenever it feels like? By precedent. Two years earlier, it had shrugged off the Bandial Court’s orders to hold elections in 90 days. Only, once the state learns to ignore some judges, it learns to ignore the lot of them.
 
 

As several worthies deciding the reserved seats matter found out: it should have come as no surprise that their 12-member verdict was flung away as casually as that of the Bandial Court’s five — they’d enabled it via bizarre dissenting notes in the 90 days case, and then by supporting the trash-fire practice and procedure law chaining their own hands.
Per historian Edward Gibbon, “Those princes … permitted for a while to hold a precarious sceptre, were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations.”
And that yoke’s latest form — the Constitutional Bench — has more than delivered: out go reserved seats, in come military trials of civilians, and from the skies new lords parachute into the last holdout: the Islamabad High Court.
Nor is the unity regime satisfied. Its eyes are on a bigger prize: the creation of a so-called Constitutional Court. If allowed to go through, what was the worst judicial regression in over 30 years risks becoming the worst in Pakistan’s history. We look at the facts.
A crazy transplant from civil law
For starters, Pakistan’s entire justice system is built on common law, as opposed to that of civil law countries. To explain, common law systems (such as the United Kingdom and its former colonies, Pakistan and India) develop the law case by case, through precedent.
This can’t be overstated: stare decisis — to stand by what’s decided — makes the law dependable and predictable, with judges leaning on verdicts that have been handed down over decades and centuries. It also means trusting the courts to interpret the law and protect the people.
History is in play here: in common law countries, it was thought that empowered, independent judges would shield the citizen from tyrannical kings (a recurring problem in Pakistan).
 
 

Civil law systems believe in no such thing: there is no strong doctrine of precedent; the code is all; and judges are considered best when applying the law’s black letter as faceless, nameless robots.
But civil law countries are also born from specific nightmares: France, their prime example, was forged in the fire of revolution, when judges were thought enemies of the people and instruments of class privilege. Restoring order to madness, Napoleon made sure to straitjacket the judges into ‘la bouche de la loi’ — the mouth of the law, and no more.
That’s already the opposite of Britannia and its South Asian heirs, where the courts only ever gained in legitimacy when opposing despots. While Napoleon’s France codified against judges, we developed the common law through them.
Take also Germany, another well-known civil law buff: its constitutional court sits atop a culture of obedience and bureaucratic discipline. Pakistan, on the other hand, is always at risk from the gloved hand; its most basic rules of the road remain unsettled; and its judges are routinely pressed into service as the final frontier against democracy’s derailment.
Does that sound like a place where judges should be reduced to bean-counters?
Interestingly, ours is the first ruling class pleading for a civil law system to escape neither degenerate elites (France) nor fascist dictatorship (Germany), but its own Supreme Court.
Supreme confusion: we already have constitutional courts
Though stating the obvious, constitutional review is already vested in our superior courts: the high courts and the Supreme Court. They are also more than happy to exercise that jurisdiction under Articles 4 and 199 (judicial review of executive action and fundamental rights), with the Supreme Court acting as the final arbiter through Articles 184, 185, and 187.
But the unity regime wishes to strip them of that core function. The demoted Supreme Court, as this writer has said previously, shall now concern itself with civil nosebleeds, land disputes, maybe the odd buffalo wandering into a stranger’s rice paddy. That is no apex court, nor what it’s for.
This also breaks the third branch altogether: from a relatively clear path — trial courts to appellate High Courts to a final Supreme Court — we now get a new forum with a dozen detours.
 
 

For one, meaningless distinctions between ‘ordinary’ and ‘constitutional’ judges will fragment what’s already considered one of the most broken legal systems in the world.
For another, constant litigation over jurisdictional boundaries — what is a ‘constitutional’ question and what is not — will fill more dockets, burn more time, and nudge out more cases.
Finally, instead of our judicial structure as one coherent pyramid, we’re set for two competing apexes, with doctrinal chaos as a result.
An extra warehouse for pliant judges
Which brings us to why this amendment is being brought in the first place.
It’s certainly not pendency; a fallacious reason that only the most cynical and intellectually dishonest lawyers can put across with a straight face. As of 2024, per the Law and Justice Commission’s report, Supreme Court cases make up just 2 per cent of total pendency in the country.
That’s right: the main focus of the 26th and 27th amendments — for all the wide-ranging havoc they have brought and will bring to the judiciary — leaves 98pc of cases and 98pc of the litigant public untouched. (Even if we toss in all superior courts, it’s still over 80pc in the cold).
 
 

Because the litigant public was never worth securing, so much as a unity regime, that same public threw out in the last election. As yet another doorstop for the unelected, the new federal court will now serve as a warehouse for pliant judges: think Constitutional Bench with a hundred times the square footage.
And as a means of executive capture, what a joy it will be: a smaller court will require fewer appointments to control; its members can be packed in a single political cycle; favourites can audition from the provinces; and the Supreme Court’s senior career judges with decades of independence baggage can be skipped over at once.
Not least, by stripping their consent from the equation, independent judges will be transferred from province to province in the manner of common bureaucrats. Imagine if, at the first sign of resistance, the centre keeps ping-ponging courageous judges between Quetta and Karachi.
It even works out in converse: those timid souls making a career of doing the executive’s bidding will have added incentive not to get any funny ideas, and continue churning out one mindless judgment after the other.
Back to the future: new court, no precedent
The selling point of any new system is its lack of a difficult past: why sweat history?
And given federal constitutional courts — Europe’s, at least — tend to turn up their nose at precedent anyway, we arrive at the real bonus: decades of rights-friendly case law can be distinguished, overruled, or declared ‘inapplicable’ under the new amendment.
The Constitutional Bench has shown us a helpful preview: its reserved seats decision is gloriously bereft of even the most basic logic, while its military trials verdict seems to be labouring under the impression that Pakistan remains frozen in Bhutto’s emergency, and that judicial independence and the right to fair trial never happened in the interim.
Hence, also, the crux of our neo-PCOs, the 26th and 27th amendments: an embarrassed state of exception can become proud law. Yes, there have been a fair few outliers. But generally, from 2009 to 2023, the post-restoration judiciary guarded its turf.
So the deep state has seen fit to raise a new judiciary instead, and upend the very terms of that restoration: a process begun in earnest when the unity regime crowed with glee that democracy could be overridden based on a fictional 4-3 verdict in the 90 days case. It was the beginning of the end, with that end turbo-charged by the year of Qazi.
 
 

In other ways, however, the judicial branch may well be regressing to the mean. After all, Pakistan has never suffered from a shortage of constitutional courts — what has forever plagued it is a lack of constitutional courage.
Or perhaps ignorance.
It can be assumed the vast majority of regime tools punching the air for a constitutional court haven’t the first idea of the difference between common law and civil law countries (or that Pakistan is a common law country at all); of the role of precedent in shaping the law over decades; of how the the forced transfer of judges is a humiliation; or of how foolish it is to blindly transplant alien organs into a republic with its own zaman, makan, and ikhwan; of how an entire judicature mustn’t be sacrificed to win sordid little grudge matches.
Yet it can equally be assumed they will become domain experts the very second the levers of power fall from their hands, and the benefit of independent judges becomes clear to them as thunder.
Sooner, one can only hope, than when drafting their own bail petitions.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06115025055796e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953492/cjcsc-general-shamshad-expresses-commitment-to-strengthening-defence-cooperation-with-brunei' target='_blank'><strong>CJCSC General Shamshad expresses commitment to strengthening defence cooperation with Brunei</strong></a><br><p>Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has held meetings with the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other officials during an official visit to the country, expressing the commitment to “further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”, a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06083230389ce16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444/trump-continues-to-comment-on-pakistan-india-may-conflict-now-says-8-planes-shot-down-essentially' target='_blank'><strong>Trump continues to comment on Pakistan-India May conflict, now says ‘8 planes shot down essentially’</strong></a><br><p>Continuing to comment on the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year, US President Donald Trump has now stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
“In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday.
“I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said.
 


He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace.
“I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said.
“A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061121095129757.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953487/pakistan-and-afghanistan-to-start-third-round-of-talks-in-istanbul-today' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Afghanistan to start third round of talks in Istanbul today</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to resume talks with Afghan Taliban representatives in Istanbul today in a third round of engagement aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and consolidating a fragile ceasefire that was initially agreed upon after border clashes last month.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
Focus of the talks
A joint statement was released by the Turkish foreign ministry following the last round of talks between the two sides. It said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose a penalty on the violating party”.
The communique further stated that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to discuss implementation.
Earlier, a diplomat from one of the mediating countries said while speaking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
Meanwhile, officials in both Islamabad and Kabul have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan — a longstanding demand of Islamabad.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week.
Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said while speaking to Dawn that Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
From borders clashes to talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on Oct 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister had said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar had stated.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6 (today).</p><small>2025-11-06 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06112308e225cac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953488/trump-administration-has-revoked-80000-non-immigrant-visas-us-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration has revoked 80,000 non-immigrant visas, US official says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since its inauguration on January 20 for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday.
The extent of the revocations, first reported by the Washington Examiner, reflects a broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump came into office, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants, including some who held valid visas.
The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said the senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.
The department also said last month that it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May said he had revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, including students, because of involvement in activities that he said went against US foreign policy priorities.
Directives from the State Department this year have ordered US diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.
Trump administration officials have said that student visa and green card holders are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s conduct in its offensive in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to US foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</p><small>2025-11-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0610164365090d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953480/elon-musks-starlink-to-start-services-in-indias-maharashtra-state' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk’s Starlink to start services in India’s Maharashtra state</strong></a><br><p>India’s Maharashtra state, home to the financial hub Mumbai, will be the first to roll out Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service in the world’s most populous country, the state’s chief minister said.
The launch of Starlink, which provides high-speed internet to remote locations using low-orbit satellites, has sparked fierce debate in India over issues ranging from predatory pricing to spectrum allocation.
India — projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end — granted Starlink a licence in June.
Maharashtra was “poised to become the first Indian state to formally collaborate with Starlink”, the state’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on the Musk-owned platform X late Wednesday.
“This collaboration … will ensure the state leads India in satellite-enabled digital infrastructure.”
In March, India’s biggest telecom service providers — Jio Platforms and its rival Bharti Airtel — announced deals with SpaceX to offer Starlink internet to their customers.
Starlink’s business operations Vice President Lauren Dreyer said she was “excited” to further India’s digital vision.
“Looking forward to connecting schools, medical facilities, and beyond in the most remote and unconnected areas once Starlink receives final approvals”, Dreyer said in a statement.
Major technology firms looking to court users in the world’s fifth-largest economy have made a flurry of announcements about expanding into the country this year.
In October, Google announced it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years to build a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base there, the largest AI hub it is investing in outside of the United States.

Having met with government leaders throughout the morning and the afternoon on Wednesday, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, also the senior vice-president of FIFA, sounded thrilled at the prospect of football moving forward in Pakistan after a decade of crisis and controversy.
Asia’s football chief is on a three-day visit to the country where he has been invited as a State Guest and having arrived on Tuesday night, he met deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar, acting president Yousuf Raza Gilani and interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to kick off his tour with talks centering on how Pakistan can make up for lost time. Other items on the agenda were the assurance of stability in the Pakistan Football Federation and the resumption of the domestic league.
After a busy day of talks, and when he sat down in the evening for an interview with Dawn in the boardroom of a plush hotel in Islamabad, Sheikh Salman said he felt “confident” that the government was willing to invest in the game and that the “only way forward was up”.
“If you look at the last eight years, since I was last here in Pakistan, a lot has changed but let’s not forget that there was a [FIFA-appointed] Normalisation Committee [for the PFF] for seven years [since 2019] and the PFF was suspended three times… it wasn’t a good sign,” he reflected on the crisis that had engulfed the federation since 2015 and ended with the election of Mohsen Gilani as the country’s football chief earlier this year.

Sheikh Salman stresses support from FIFA and AFC, expresses confidence that government will play its part in game’s development

“All we wanted was the constitution and the statutes [of the PFF] according to FIFA and the AFC and it took so much time just to do that. Finally, though, it was done and we had an election with the statutes approved and a new board in place.
“We’re looking forward to working together. What matters is the future. We’ve wasted so much time in the past but we must look today at what can be done and how we can support the growth of football in Pakistan through FIFA’s programmes and the AFC. This country has so much potential and I’m sure that the only way forward is going up.”
The AFC chief, who has known Mohsen “for a long time”, feels he is the right man to take Pakistan football forward.
“When Mohsen  was elected, I was happy because he is a football person,” added Sheikh Salman. “He has a vision, a FIFA Masters degree which not a lot of member association presidents have. It’s good we have someone who has a football background but we need to give him the support and give him the chance to show and then judge. We need to judge him after a period of time to see what he can do.
“I think it is a challenge for him but it is a challenge for us as well. I don’t think he can do it on his own or I can do it on my own. It means the unity of everyone to achieve what we hope for. We want to be close to the PFF because the president has a plan. Whether it is through the private sector or the government or FIFA, we need to be side by side. But we need to support him to have a stable organisation running football in Pakistan.”
Sheikh Salman, however, insisted that there will be no compromise on accountability.
“We need to learn from the past, we don’t need to make the same mistakes,” he said, hinting at the previous regime. “Mohsen is in for a full term and I’ve told him that I’ll support you but you will be accountable as well. I want to see positives.”
Since taking over as president, Mohsen’s body has been plagued by funding issues — most notably the control over bank accounts and an audit of the term of the Normalisation Committee. Sheikh Salman insisted that financial support will come in due course.
“The AFC and the FIFA support is going to come if you prepare everything in the right way because the global and continental organisations want to know that the funds are used in the proper way,” he said. “We have set certain regulations that all 211 members of FIFA have to follow and if the rules are followed, the support will come.”
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
The AFC chief emphasised that the responsibility of developing the sport shouldn’t lie solely with the federation, or FIFA and the AFC.
He looked forward to the government playing its due part but without compromising the independence of the PFF. National sports federations, including the PFF, have for years cried foul over interference into their matters but Sheikh Salman expressed his pleasure that, for now, the government and the PFF are on the same page.
“The rules are clear in dividing responsibilities and we all know about the role of the government, which is an important one, what the role of the federation is and what our role is as well,” he said. “We cannot interfere more as we should as well … we have our limits. But we have to support the independence of the federation as well, and how we can support them, whether it is us or the government.
“We shouldn’t rule out the role of the government. We don’t have that problem in other countries … we have it in certain countries. But we are there to make sure they don’t happen. I feel the Pakistan government is serious in investing in the game and I know there are certain capabilities I cannot ask for but it’s a responsibility we all share and we need to work on.
“In football there is not always enough no matter what you do. No matter how much you pour in, it’s still not enough. But we’ve seen a lot of results in certain countries where resources are limited but the results are great and this defines success.
“I’m not asking Pakistan to win the Asian Cup today but I’m asking how we can attract people to play because football has a social responsibility not just about competitiveness but we want to introduce it to schools, to neighbourhoods. And I know there are a lot of kids around who want to play.”
There, however, is also the need for competition and the resumption of domestic competitions. The Pakistan Premier Football League has not been held since 2019 and while the debate rages on whether the new competition is franchise-based or club-based, Sheikh Salman says it should be a model “that works best for the country”.
“It’s a local decision, the people of PFF would know exactly which system suits them, whether it is franchise or other way around,” he said. “We are ready to advise on the pros and cons but it depends on having the right partner to support you.”
He, however, cautioned into buying into the idea of a franchise league too quickly.
“It should be a proper professional league and not one that runs for three months,” he said. “It has to be a good balance between the football aspect and the commercial side. We want to keep it hand in hand, not one taking over the other. If there is a vision and the government also wants it, it will happen. But let’s take it step by step. We don’t want to aim so high but to start the league is the first step.”
Note: This is the first part of a wide-ranging interview with the AFC president. The second part will be published in Friday’s edition.

Or has the age of unilateral control already taken hold, leaving cooperation and regional stability a nostalgic memory?
The answer, sadly, is playing out in the valleys and deserts of our immediate neighbourhood. Pakistan now finds itself caught in a dual chokehold. In April 2025, India suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, the only long-standing negotiated framework between upper and lower riparians in South Asia. Soon thereafter, plans to divert the Chenab through new inter-basin can­als were announced. Simultaneously, Afghan­is­tan, unbound by any treaty with Pakistan, dec­la­red it would dam the Kunar River before it returns to our territory.
Upstream states are increasingly weaponising water resources. The scholarship is clear, yet, often ignored. As Mark Zeitoun and Jeroen Warner’s influential 2006 framework on hydro-hegemony contended, “Power is the most fundamental aspect in controlling water in a transboundary river basin.” This provides a clear articulation of how upstream states exercise power over shared waters, consistent with arguments about upstream arbitrariness and dominance in water governance.
Since the 1950s, the unilateral construction of massive dams and diversion projects has remained a preferred strategy to secure water for agriculture and hydropower. But at what cost? Chronic scarcity, ecological collapse, and geopolitical crises have become the unfortunate downstream legacy.

Upstream states are increasingly weaponising water resources.

Let’s look at the fate of four other neighbouring basins, arbitrarily bifurcated at the time when the internationally negotiated Indus Waters Treaty was coming to life.
Nile Basin: The foundational example of this trend is the construction of the Aswan Dam, completed in 1970. This massive structure provided Egypt with ultimate control over the Nile’s flow, securing its water share unilaterally based on a 1959 agreement with Sudan that deliberately excluded upstream states like Ethiopia. This was a foundational act of hydro-hegemony.
This historical power structure has come full circle. Ethiopia’s unilateral decision to fill and operate the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam represents a direct attempt to overturn Egypt’s historical control. The past has finally caught up with the hegemon. The result? A future of more frequent droughts threatens to reduce the Nile’s flow, adding an existential urgency, and potential for conflict.
 
 

Jordan River: This weaponisation of upstream control, first perfected on the Nile, found a more immediate and violent echo along the Jordan River. Israel’s National Water Carrier, completed in 1964, was a major diversion project. When the Arab League planned its counter-diversion, it led to cross-border military skirmishes that eventually culminated in the Six-Day Arab-Israel War in 1967. The basin’s crisis is exacerbated by being one of the most severely impacted regions globally by rising temperatures and reduced precipitation.
Tigris and Euphrates: After decades of planning, Turkiye initiated the massive Southeastern Anatolia Project, known as GAP, in the 1980s, establishing permanent upstream-downstream power asymmetry with Syria and Iraq. This is compounded by Iran’s more than a dozen dams and diversion tunnels on Tigris tributaries.
This structural asymmetry results in the slow death of Mesopotamia as multi-year droughts accelerate the collapse of agriculture and intensify the desertification of the once-fertile floodplains. The consequence is not just local: this creates massive ‘Sand and Dust Storms’ which sometimes reach as far as Balochistan, proving that water conflicts have profound, border-transcending ecological consequences.
Kura-Aras Basin: In the South Caucasus, the Aras River forms the borders between Turkiye, Armenia, Iran, and Azerbaijan. Here, water diversion by Armenia does more than just reduce quantity; it carries severe pollution, disproportionately affecting downstream Iran and Azerbaijan who suffer from both scarcity and environmental degradation. The pattern of unilateral control is being tragically repeated across South and Central Asia.
Ganges River: The Farakka Barrage on the Ganges diverts water towards the Hooghly River, significantly reducing the dry-season flow into Bangladesh. Despite the Ganges Water Treaty (1996), the unilateral diversions continue, particularly concerning the critical Teesta River. Bangladesh is affected by the Himalayan glacial recession, and increasingly volatile monsoon patterns exacerbate water scarcity.
The Amu Darya and Kabul River systems: This acute Central Asian hydropolitical stress is a microcosm of a larger regional dynamic, particularly concerning governance by Afghanistan. The massive Qosh Tepa Canal project on the Amu Darya is designed to divert 17-20 per cent of the river’s flow to irrigate Afghanistan’s northern provinces. This canal poses a direct threat to the established water quotas of downstream Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which rely heavily on the Amu Darya. The absence of a basin-wide agreement ensures that this diversion will deepen existing water conflicts, pushing regional players to the breaking point.
Furthermore, the construction and operation of the Kamal Khan Dam on the Helmand River significantly reduces essential water flows into Iran, directly violating the 1973 Helmand River Water Treaty. Unilateral resource development illustrates a wider trend where new infrastructure projects directly translate to reduced water security for neighbours.
Afghanistan’s major river systems (like the Kabul River and its tributary the Kunar) are crucially dependent on snow and glacier melt from the Hindukush. This vital upstream position ma­­kes development politically charged, as seen in the recent tensions over the reported plan for a dam or diversion project on the Kunar River that flows into Pakistan’s Indus system — a direct parallel to the pressures India is exerting on the Chenab.
The era of negotiated water-sharing is ending, replaced by the unilateral control of upstream states from the Nile to the Indus. They prioritise rapid development over shared resource integrity, accelerating instability and water stress, which is magnified by climate change into an existential threat. The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty proves that such agreements are tragically vulnerable to hydro-hegemony. Failure to cooperate leads not just to conflict, but to structural disaster. The global community must recognise unilateral river diversion not as an act of sovereignty, but an act of water aggression.

Conversations with those in the provincial governments who are familiar with these developments suggest they are preparing to accommodate this pressure, but in a way that does not require amending the constitutional clause which guarantees that the provincial share in the NFC award will not be reduced.
It is hard to make a case for sharing the costs of debt servicing with the provinces. Unless the centre is willing to agree that it will only take on additional debt with the approval of the provincial governments, it cannot ask them to share in the cost of servicing this debt. But defence expenditure is different. The provinces can be told that since they are beneficiaries of the protection provided by the armed forces, some portion of the cost of maintaining this protection must be borne by them. The room to debate this matter is now limited since the centre has indicated that it must get assent on this question, otherwise it will modify the Constitution to extract the resources it needs regardless.
The total amount being asked of the provinces is supposedly around Rs500 billion per annum. The provinces have to agree on two things. First, they have to agree on who will bear how much of the burden to free up this amount between them. Second they have to agree on a mechanism on how the freed-up funds will be transferred. The next NFC meeting is scheduled tentatively for Nov 27. If the provinces come to this meeting with their assent to free up Rs500bn from their share of NFC transfers for defence-related expenditures of the federal government, and a viable mechanism through which to do this, the need to amend Article 160(3A) will not be necessary and that part of the 27th amendment which seeks to amend this clause may get dropped.
 
 

What is most important for the provincial governments at this time is to provide their assent to the demand from the centre. Once that happens the rest is negotiation, and they can take more time to agree on the burden sharing between them and the mechanism.

What is most important for the provinces at this time is to provide their assent to the demand from the centre.

Here are a few things that could make their job a little simpler. A formula already exists to allocate the provincial share of the federal divisible pool among the provinces. Perhaps the same formula can be used to determine the burden each province must share to free up Rs500bn worth of resources from their NFC transfers. This would mean about half of the total would have to come from Punjab, a quarter from Sindh, 16 per cent from KP and around 10pc from Balochistan.
Second, some mechanisms already exist through which provincial government resources are paid out directly to the army. For example, every time a provincial government calls the army in aid of civil power they have to pay for the costs of the deployment from their own resources. What would be required now would be a series of modifications to make such a mechanism automatic, and some kind of legal cover so that a portion of the defence budget can be made part of the obligations that a provincial government has to meet. Once this is done, then a separate stream can be opened under NFC transfers, whereby the provincial government’s share of the defence budget would automatically be credited to the army’s account.
None of this requires a constitutional amendment. The NFC is enough of a forum to build the consensus and any necessary legislation can then be passed by the relevant assemblies relatively easily. The share of the provinces under NFC transfers will not be impacted. What will change will be the amount landing up in provincial government coffers under these transfers.
The impact of this will hit Punjab the hardest. The other provinces can still bear their share of the burden being demanded without having to modify their entire budget strategy. But Punjab is ruled by a chief minister who apparently wants to spend her way to the prime ministership and the enormous funds being spent on schemes to buy her popularity will take a huge hit. It could be an unrealistic expectation on her part already to think that she can buy the Punjab voter this easily. The strategy of buying the Punjab voters’ loyalty was followed by Nawaz Sharif in the years of his ascendancy. But there are reasons to believe it may not work this time round. Can Maryam Nawaz afford a Rs250bn hit to her budget while holding on to this ambition? She may well have no choice.
What the provinces are going to be wary of is ensuring that the amount stays at Rs500bn in the years to come. Having given their assent to shoulder some of the responsibility for meeting the costs of national defence, they will naturally worry that the amount could rise next year, and then again the year after and so on. How can they agree to this demand in a way that would also cap their share at the outset?
There is no easy answer here. Perhaps they can have the amount written down in the NFC award, so modifying it would require another award altogether. And the threat of a constitutional amendment is a heavy one and cannot be wielded easily and often. Once the amount is inscribed in the NFC, next to the same language that enshrines provincial shares in the federal divisible pool, or the proceeds of royalties from crude oil or natural gas development surcharge, it would provide a somewhat secure ceiling that would still require some effort at consensus building to modify.
The other clauses of the so-called 27th amendment are a different story. But for the NFC award, it is possible that an amendment may not be required provided the provinces agree to shoulder a part of the burden of defence spending.

Mr Mamdani, who will become the Big Apple’s first mayor of Muslim and South Asian descent, has indeed created history, through a relentless campaign to convince the citizens of one of the world’s greatest and most diverse cities to give him a chance in the driving seat. His victory also gives progressive forces the world over some hope at a time when the far right is ascendant globally. Mr Mamdani is truly a citizen of the world; his parents have roots in the subcontinent, he was born in Uganda and later became a naturalised American citizen, while his wife is Syrian.
Domestically, his appeal to NYC’s working men and women, its immigrant communities and young voters helped pull off a stunning victory. The self-professed social democrat’s campaign promised to confront the cost of living crisis by raising taxes on the superrich. On the foreign front, he is a staunch supporter of Palestine.
 
 

After the euphoria fades and Mr Mamdani moves into City Hall, he will have his work cut out for him. After all, his progressive stances — and proud embrace of his religious and ethnic identity — have earned him strong detractors. Perhaps the most prominent is the US president, who has derisively referred to the mayor-elect as a ‘communist’, and had earlier threatened to cut federal funding of NYC if Mr Mamdani won.
Moreover, the Democratic Party establishment was slow in its endorsement, while NYC’s new mayor faced vile abuse targeting his religion, ethnic background, and even his eating habits, on the campaign trail. He was also accused of antisemitism for resisting the powerful Zionist lobby.
All these negative forces will continue to create obstacles in Zohran Mamdani’s way. Yet his victory — as well as Sadiq Khan’s success as London mayor — is a resounding denunciation of the far right’s demonisation of Muslims and immigrants.
These political journeys show that many young voters in the West are looking to back candidates that support social and economic justice platforms, and are least concerned about candidates’ ethnic or confessional backgrounds. Racists and Islamophobes may be on the march, but Mr Mamdani’s victory rekindles some hope.

• Says any cut in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 9.4pc share in NFC award unacceptable
ISLAMABAD: The PTI parliamentary party on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, after the chief minister was reportedly denied access on four occasions despite directions issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The resolution, which was later submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat, claimed that Mr Khan is the head of Pakistan’s largest political party and that it is the constitutional and democratic right of the KP chief minister to meet him in Adiala jail.
Members of the parliamentary party deman­ded that the IHC’s orders be implemented, terming the continued denial a violation of democratic norms and parliamentary mandate.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was present during the meeting.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi warned that the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment would amount to an attack on provincial autonomy.
He said that the KP government would take all possible steps to resist what he described as an attempt to roll back powers guaranteed to provinces under the Constitution.
He stated that the proposed amendment was “nothing but an encroachment on provincial rights” and that it would not be tolerated at any cost.
He added that PTI considered itself the guardian of the Constitution and would continue to protect it.
KP CM to visit jail again today
Responding to questions about his repeated attempts to meet the PTI founder in jail, Mr Afridi expressed disappointment that the IHC’s facilitation orders had not been implemented and said his democratic right had been violated.
He announced that he would visit Adiala jail on Thursday (today), noting that meetings with Mr Khan were officially allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
About the NFC Award, Mr Afridi said that KP’s share of 19.4 per cent must not be reduced.
He argued that KP had rendered the greatest sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, with many of its residents martyred, and that decreasing the province’s financial share would amount to ignoring those sacrifices.
Post on Imran’s X account
Meanwhile, a post issued from Imran Khan’s account on the social media platform X, reportedly based on comments shared by his sister, claimed that the rule of law no longer prevailed in the country. It remains unclear who currently operates Mr Khan’s account; however, he has never publicly disassociated himself from posts made in his name.
 






The post described the current leadership as presiding over a period of “oppression” and alleged that incidents such as those of May 9, 2023, and the recent events in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Muridke represented abuses of state authority.
In a message directed at supporters, the PTI founder stated that a nation which embraces the principle of “freedom or death” cannot be stopped from attaining true independence.
He said that legal counsel Salman Akram Raja would transmit all party-related instructions and ensure their implementation.
PTI to oppose 27th Amendment
Separately, PTI Central Infor­mation Secre­tary Sheikh Waqas Akram reaffirmed that the party would go to any extent to block the proposed 27th Constitution Amendment.
 
 

He alleged that a non-representative government was pushing the amendment to weaken provincial autonomy, politicise state institutions, curtail media freedom, restrict judicial independence, and concentrate power.
He said the PTI would not allow the government to undo provincial rights, undermine parliamentary authority, or compromise on judicial oversight, stating that such measures would be unacceptable.

On Monday, Washington circulated the document among several Council members, proposing a mandate of at least two years, until December 2027, along with the possibility of extensions.
Diplomats privy to developments told Dawn that President Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan is attached to the resolution that all UN Security Council members formally received on Tuesday afternoon.
The resolution, one source said, contains several ambiguities.
The draft does not seek a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, which will operate under the newly proposed Board of Peace.
The ISF is also expected to disarm Hamas, but will have no authority over Israeli military activities. The resolution also makes no reference to a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” although the concept is included in Trump’s 20-point plan.
Pakistan was among the parties that received the draft resolution last week, although it has not yet taken a public position on it. Even Indonesia has conveyed that it will not send troops to Gaza if the objective is “only to disarm Hamas”.
Jakarta, like the rest of the eight-nation Muslim bloc, is also seeking a UN mandate for the mission — if not for the force — and wants the UNSC to have a role.

• SAEP maintains it is not on strike, can’t issue clearance certificates at passengers’ expense
RAWALPINDI: The PIA on Wednesday managed to “partially restore its flight operations” amid a protest by aircraft engineers under the umbrella of the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP).
The tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP has been going on for three days over the safety of aircraft, causing delays in the departure of domestic and international flights at multiple major airports. On Wednesday, the PIA cancelled six flights to adjust the schedule of already delayed flights.
On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
The PIA claimed that the engineers were on “strike” while the SAEP said that they were on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Against this backdrop, the PIA management called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday.
A PIA spokesman confirmed that the two office-bearers were summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them had been underway. The PIA will initiate legal action against them in line with the law, he explained. He said that PIA flight operations had been partially restored through alternative means, hoping that the situation would become normal very soon.
SAEP Secretary General Awais Jadoon said that they are on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances,” he explained.
He said that the engineers were not on strike, adding that they could not make compromises on the safety of travellers, as they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
When asked about their meeting with the PIA management, he explained that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.

A parliamentary delegation of opposition parties led by Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who has also been nominated as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, visited the JUI-F chief’s residence in Islamabad.
 






The delegation also included Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Allama Raja Nasir, who has been nominated as the leader of the opposition in the Senate, and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, the former speaker of the National Assembly.
A statement posted by the JUI-F on social media platform X said that the leaders discussed the prevailing political situation.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Rehman warned those in power against making the Constitution a “plaything”. He said that a little over a year later, the government was pushing through another constitutional amendment in the same manner as before.
 
 

“When amendments are made under coercion, how can the people continue to have faith in the Constitution?” he questioned.
“My fear is that if this continues, public trust in the Constitution will be completely eroded,” he said. The JUI-F said that during deliberations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the government was “forced to withdraw 34 clauses that would have undermined key constitutional protections”.
“But now preparations are once again underway to do the same,” he lamented. He further said that the opposition had not yet received the draft of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, questioning how the legislation could be tabled in Parliament in such a scenario.
“But opposition parties will develop a unified stance on it collectively,” he said. The Maulana further said that the political environment was deliberately being pushed towards confrontation.
“One minister has been working on this amendment for three months. It means that the contents of this amendment came from somewhere else,” the JUI-F chief alleged.
He also accused Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of deceiving the people, saying that up until recently the PML-N leader had been saying that there was no need for another amendment.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Qaiser said that the JUI-F chief had supported Achakzai’s stance.
“We will look at the 27th Constitutional Amendment collectively. The opposition will be united in the House,” he said.
He further maintained that Achakzai should be notified as the leader of the opposition in the lower house of Parliament as soon as possible.
Speaking to Dawn prior to the meeting, MWM’s Nasir said that there were two main reasons behind the opposition’s criticism of the proposed amendment.
“First, the 26th Constitutional Amendment is currently under litigation and is considered a controversial document,” he pointed out.
“We also oppose the 27th Amendment because we do not know what it entails. How can we support something we are completely unaware of?” he asked. Nasir slammed the incumbent government, saying that it had made a mockery of the state, the democratic system and the nation by showing a lack of transparency.
The meeting of the opposition leaders came the same day that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment was expected within two to three days, after which the legislation was likely to be tabled in Parliament next week.
Earlier this week, the PPP said the government had sought its support for the proposed changes to the Constitution. According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
On Tuesday, Deputy PM Dar had confirmed the 27th Constitutional Amendment would be brought before Parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment.</p><small>2025-11-06 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/060753576b0f361.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953376/pakistan-among-nations-using-water-inefficiently' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan among nations using water ‘inefficiently’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan is one of six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use amid increasingly arid conditions, contributing to the annual global loss of 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater, according to the first edition of the global water monitoring report by World Bank.
The report, “Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future,” says about one-quarter of inefficient water consumption in rain-fed agriculture and one-third in irrigated agriculture are concentrated in regions experiencing declining freshwater availability.
These hot spots, where water inefficiency coincides with drying trends, are most pronounced in Western Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Africa.
On a national level, the highest share of inefficient agricultural water consumption under drying conditions is observed in Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Pakistan, Thailand, Tunisia and Romania, the report says.

WB report reveals world is losing 324 billion  cubic metres  of freshwater every year

Drawing on two decades of satellite data enhanced through new modelling techniques, the report provides an unprecedented view of how land and water management decisions are shaping water availability.
The past two decades have seen a global shift toward the cultivation of more water-intensive crops. Among drying countries, 37 have transitioned to more water-intensive agriculture, including 22 located in arid and semi-arid regions. This structural shift, coupled with inefficiency, further intensifies water demand in already water-stressed countries.
More than two-thirds of the inefficient irrigation in drying areas is linked to the cultivation of water-intensive crops, underscoring the need for smarter crop choices that align agricultural practices with water sustainability.
The report reveals that the world is losing 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater every year, enough to meet the needs of 280 million people annually. These losses are driven by worsening droughts and unsustainable practices, including poor pricing policies, weak coordination, deforestation and wetland degradation.
Global water use has risen 25 percent since 2000, with a third of that increase occurring in areas already drying out.

• Rahul hopes to repeat his UP success in Bihar with Lalu’s party
NEW DELHI: Two-stage state polls for the 243-seat Bihar assembly starting today (Thursday) are being seen as critical for the durability of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s minority government.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) party crucially shores up the Modi government, in which the BJP stands reduced to 240 seats from the 2024 general elections, well below the halfway mark of 272 in the Lok Sabha.
Mr Kumar’s JD(U) with 12 MPs and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu with 16 Telugu Desam MPs hold Mr Modi’s fate in their palms. Mr Modi, heading the ruling National Democ­ratic Alliance (NDA), has merely 21 MPs above a simple majority, and the two allies from Bihar and Andhra Prad­esh together add up to 28 MPs.
 
 

The NDA is widely seen as being held together in a quid pro quo arrangement whereby Mr Modi’s BJP supports the minority government of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, and he supports Mr Modi. Any setback to Mr Kumar’s hold over Bihar in the assembly polls — a scenario not being ruled out by pollsters — could adversely impact Mr Modi’s hold on Mr Kumar’s support for him. Mr Naidu too is a hard bargainer who began his political career as a Youth Congress leader.
However, much more is making the Bihar state polls on Nov 6 and 11 so crucial for everyone in the fray.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a significant comeback for his party in 2024, a gain that elevated him as the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. But the laurels were won in lockstep with allies, chiefly in Uttar Pradesh where, together with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress was able to pare down Mr Modi’s numbers drastically.
Uttar Pradesh was principally responsible for the BJP’s loss of majority under Mr Modi’s watch. Rahul Gandhi is hoping for an encore, to upset the BJP in Bihar, this with the alliance he has formed with former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son. To their advantage, Bihar is the only Hindi-speaking state where the BJP has not been able to take power from its allies.
The question is, given the dire threats and pressures on both sides, would the BJP allow the opposition to gain the leg up. Mr Gandhi not for the first time may have put the finger on the nub of the matter. He has accused the election commission of working in cahoots with and for the BJP to steal the Bihar election.
 
 

He asserts this with the support of what appears to be the election commission’s fudged voters lists in recent state polls in Haryana where the Congress was unexpectedly trounced and in Maharashtra, where a Congress alliance was allegedly robbed of victory, were rigged with the connivance of the election commission.
The core of the charge concerns the excessively powerful election body’s drive to carry out a nationwide Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter’s list like the one that was carried out amid controversy in poll-bound Bihar. Mr Modi had changed the rules for nominating the election commissioner thereby giving himself a freehand to choose his man.
The opposition alleges that the election commission is helping the BJP by deleting voters perceived to be opposed to the BJP, primarily Muslims. The issue has galvanised opposition governments in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have joined hands with the Congress to widen the allegation into a movement.
The most threatened by any arbitrary act to tweak the voter’s list is West Bengal where the Mamata Bannerjee government enjoys more than a handy support of Muslims. Curiously, the BJP-ruled states of Assam and Tripura have been left out of the coming round of revision of the voter’s list. Opposition has cried foul over the exclusion.
So, what is going to happen in Bihar? Its caste arithmetic is as crucial as it is murky. The state abuts Nepal with which it shares an open border. Recent events in the landlocked country are being watched in Bihar. Gen Z voters are at the heart of this election campaign in Bihar: the state has India’s largest proportion of youth population.
“Nearly 58 per cent of Bihar’s population is under 25 years of age and hence belong to the Generation Z cohort,” says The Wire. “In terms of voters, one in every four voters is a Gen Z. Of them, 1.47 million are first-time voters.”

According to a quarterly report released by the Power Division, the new fiscal year began with Rs1.614tr, compared with Rs2.467tr in the same period last year. It said payables to power producers increased to Rs944bn at the close of September, up from Rs861bn at the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The payables to power producers had amounted to Rs1.688tr as of end-September last year.
The report said past debt parked in the Power Holding Company of the Power Division remained unchanged at Rs660bn during the first quarter of the fiscal year. It stood at Rs683bn by the end of the first quarter last year.
The power division reported that circular debt increased by more than Rs170bn due to inefficiencies and inadequate bill recovery by the Distribution Companies (Discos). However, this was significantly lower than the Rs239bn under the same account and period of the last fiscal year.

Power Division blames Rs79bn rise on inefficiencies, seasonal factors

The report showed that circular debt had increased by Rs73bn in the first quarter of last year, compared to Rs79bn this year. This was despite the fact that the finance ministry had disbursed Rs19bn in budgeted subsidies, compared to Rs28bn in unreleased subsidies during the same period last year. This was on top of Rs178bn in additional recoveries from consumers due to prior-year adjustments.
Excluding the above Rs198bn in additional funds from subsidies and prior-year adjustments, the circular debt would have increased by Rs276bn on account of Rs67bn in interest charges, Rs5bn in pending generation costs, Rs87bn due to distribution companies’ inefficiencies, and Rs84bn in under-recoveries.
The report claimed Rs229bn in receivables from K-Electric as of end-September 2025, including a principal amount of Rs42bn and about Rs187bn in markup.
 
 

The power division in a statement, however, tried to dispel the impression caused by its own report that an increase in circular debt by Rs79bn in the first quarter of the new fiscal year was a renewed upward trend, contrary to the government’s commitment to contain circular debt accumulation.
A Power Division spokesperson said the increase of Rs79bn in the first quarter “should be viewed in full context”. It said during the same quarter last year, circular debt had increased by Rs73bn, but by the end of that fiscal year, the overall stock of circular debt was reduced by Rs780bn. “The current quarterly rise is therefore attributable to seasonal and operational factors that typically influence monthly flows and are expected to reverse over the course of the year,” he said.
Importantly, Disco’s inefficiencies (losses and low recoveries) during July-September were reduced by Rs67bn to Rs171bn, compared to Rs239bn in the same period last year, underscoring the government’s firm commitment to improving operational performance and maintaining financial discipline in the power sector.

• Justifies changes to Article 243 as defence needs ‘have changed’
• Latest tweaks not meant to roll back 18th Amendment, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tells NA
ISLAMABAD: Clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment is expected within two to three days, after which the legislation is likely to be tabled in parliament next week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday.
Separately, the National Assembly was also assu­red that the 18th Amen­dment would not be rolled back through the new legislation.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Asif said consultations were underway on amendments to the law governing the armed forces as the government considers constitutional changes. He stressed that discussions on amending Article 243 were ongoing because “defence requirements have changed”.
 
 

Article 243 of the Constitution provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and that “the supreme command of the armed forces shall vest in the president”.
Earlier, speaking to the media outside parliament, Mr Asif said he could not share details about reservations or discussions concerning the 27th Amendment.
He added that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had every right to express his views and that the government was enga­ging other parties in the same spirit to seek input.
‘Guesswork’
Meanwhile, responding to points raised by opposition members in the Nati­onal Assembly, Minis­ter for Parliamentary Aff­a­irs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry urg­ed an end to “negative and false propaganda” and den­­­­o­unced attempts to ma­ke the 27th Amen­dm­ent controversial ba­sed on “ass­­u­­mptions and gues­s­work” as an official draft has yet to see the light of day.
He said there was no plan to take control of provincial educational institutions or boards. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he said.
The minister said no step would be taken that weakened the federation, the provinces or their relationship. “The purpose is to improve governance, bolster defence and stre­ngthen ties between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked.
He added that allies and all stakeholders wou­ld be taken on board and that matters relating to the NFC would be decided through consultation.
Regretting that the 26th Amendment, passed last year, had also been portrayed as an attack on judicial independence, he said a separate constitutional court, as proposed in the 27th Amendment, would help reduce case backlogs. He noted that establishing such a court had been agr­e­ed upon in the Charter of Democracy, signed by the PML-N and the PPP in 2006.
He stressed that constitutional amendments req­u­ire a two-thirds majority, not consensus, and said the spirit of the Consti­tution would be upheld.
Call for consensus
Earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said constitutional amendments should be passed with consensus, as happened in the neighbouring country in the past.
He argued that the 27th Amendment would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution and warned the government against dividing the nation. “It will further jeopardise the independence of the judiciary,” he said.
Barrister Gohar said the government was putting the federation at risk by pushing the amendment, adding that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
“These subjects were devolved to the provinces with the passage of the 18th Amendment,” he noted. He also questioned why a draft of the 27th Amendment had been leaked.
He said the opposition had proposed Mahmood Khan Achakzai as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, submitting his name to the speaker’s office with signatures of 72 MNAs. “As per rules, the speaker should name the opposition leader; otherwise, I shall request Mr Achakzai to occupy the seat himself,” he said.
He also recalled the Supreme Court’s 2022 judgement directing the federal government to legislate within 45 days to provide civilians convicted by military courts the right to appeal in the civilian judiciary, and called for its implementation.
In his speech, Malik Aamir Dogar demanded that the chair immediately name Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition under the rules.
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa, who was chairing the proceedings, suggested the opposition visit the speaker’s office to discuss the issue, as a case in this regard was in court. 
Journalists’ walkout
Also on Wednesday, reporters covering the proceedings of the National Assembly also staged a walkout from the Press Gallery before start of Question Hour, to protest recent sacking of employees from a number of TV channels and curbs on media freedom.
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah sent Information Minister Attaullah Tarar to negotiate with the protesting journalists.
Speaking on the occasion, Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA) MB Soomro expressed his serious concerns over the recent sackings of a number of media workers from TV channels and various media organisations. He also in a forceful manner drew the attention of the minister towards the suspension of the government advertisements to Daily Dawn.
Later, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, the minister expressed concern over the dismissal of journalists by several media organisations without prior notice or valid justification. He said the issue would be raised during a meeting with media owners scheduled for next week.
“We have ensured that timely payments are made to media houses, and we expect that these financial benefits will also reach working journalists and media staff,” he said.
Mr Tarar said a delegation of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) had met him to present a charter of demands. These demands will be discussed with media owners, including the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and All Pakistan Newspaper Society (APNS), in the upcoming meeting to find a lasting solution, he added.

Member administration of NHA, Omar Saeed Chaudhri, has also been repatriated to his parent department, the Ministry of Defence.
The Establishment Division issued two separate notifications regarding the removal of the NHA chairman and the repatriation of the member to the Ministry of Defence.
When contacted, the NHA spokesman said no one in the NHA and the Ministry of Communication was aware of the reason behind the chairman’s sudden removal. “The chairman worked in the office today (Wednesday) till 6pm, and the decision came in the night that stunned all in the NHA,” he added.
The removal of the chairman is believed to be the fall of the biggest wicket in the NHA amid the Carec controversy, as before this development, PM Shehbaz had already suspended eight senior officials of the NHA for being involved in irregularities in the award of Carec Tranche III project, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
Meanwhile, a source in the NHA told Dawn that the chairman was removed mainly because of the Carec controversy.
The Carec Tranche-III project has also come under scrutiny in five standing committees of the Senate and the National Assembly and the Public
Four days ago, the inquiry committee, formed by PM Shehbaz to investigate irregularities Carec project, had submitted its report.
A source in the Prime Minister’s Office had said the findings had been submitted to the premier in a sealed envelope, who is likely to decide the fate of the probe in “a day or so”.
In August, the premier had suspended eight senior NHA officials and formed a committee to probe irregularities in the award of the contract, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
PM Shehbaz had tasked inquiry to review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; examine whether the NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of Carec Tranche-III project; assess whether the NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process transparently and judiciously; evaluate all stages in the award of the project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; suggest a way forward on the current process; and review any other matter ancillary to the above.
In September, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division recommended blacklisting a joint venture of three firms, which were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor, the Asian Development Bank, to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
Carec is an Asian Development Bank-supported initiative that was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region.

People were stuck in traffic jams for hours during the peak evening rush after the main thoroughfare of MA Jinnah road near Numaish Chowrangi was closed by police for security reasons.
The city’s traffic police had announced different diversions after the closure of the route, leading to traffic chaos, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice.
Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) Deputy Inspector General Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn that all traffic officers were present on the roads.
He said a portion of the main MA Jinnah road was closed for traffic, which had caused the traffic jam.
The city traffic police chief admitted that the citizens were facing immense inconvenience due to gridlocks. He said the roads near Numaish Chowrangi were closed for traffic because of security reasons, and diversions were provided to the citizens for the smooth flow of traffic.
CM Shah directed Karachi’s additional inspector general of police to restore the flow of traffic. “Traffic police should be activated immediately for restoration of the traffic flow,” he said, and summoned a situation report.
CM Shah warned officers of strict action if the traffic flow was not restored.
“Wherever there is a traffic jam, responsible officers will face action,” he declared, directing timely action for the convenience of the general public.</p><small>2025-11-05 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05224201ac352e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953324/pakistan-to-tap-loss-and-damage-fund-despite-reservations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to tap loss and damage fund despite reservations</strong></a><br><p>As the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD) opens for business at COP30 later this month with money grossly insufficient to address damage caused by climate change, Pakistan is expected to submit proposals to the tune of $10-20 million to the FRLD board despite reservations.
Three years after its operationalisation at COP27 in Egypt, the fund has about $300 million in total and pledges of $700m by the Global North countries. Intended as a rapid response fund, the fund, with its interim secretariat based in the World Bank, has failed to disburse even a single penny to the affected countries, said civil society leaders spearheading the ‘Fill the Fund’ campaign.
Climate minister Musadik Malik also confirmed that Pakistan did not receive a single dollar from the loss and damage fund despite the catastrophic losses it has faced due to global warming.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn, Malik said the fund decided to operationalise $250m for its call for proposals at COP30 in Belem and 50 per cent of this amount was exclusive to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
“This means about $100-150m is set aside for the rest of the world, including Pakistan,” he said, adding the government was working on some projects in light of this call for proposals.

He said it was too early to share details as these ideas required time to shape up, adding that proposals worth up to $20m were under consideration.
The call for proposals came after the FRLD’s seventh board meeting (B7) in Manila last month, in which the board approved interim rules for its operationalisation while deferring some key decisions, leaving the fund reliant on insufficient resources.
North-South ideological divergence
Like all other climate negotiations, the meeting was fundamentally defined by a North-South ideological “divergence over the speed and mechanism of financial disbursements”.
 
 

One of the key criticisms against the fund is its “slow, bureaucratic design and complex rules for access”, which are completely at odds with the need for immediate relief, according to ‘Fill the Fund’ campaigners.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s climate minister said the hypocrisy of the Global North is daunting, as they are trying to shift their burden to the developing economies instead of paying for the damage they caused to the climate during their development.
It is very bizarre how these negotiations work out, he said while speaking about bureaucratic procedures that mar the climate talks.
Speaking about divergence between the North and the South, he said the developed world is seeking compliance from the developing states, while the latter are asking for a resource pool, technology and finance.

“But commitments are not worth the piece of paper on which they are published unless they are resourced… We say put your money where your mouth is because you have made this money by consuming the climate over the 100s of years,” the minister said.
Musadik pointed out that excessive bureaucracy and hypocrisy evident at climate talks defeat the purpose of such a rapid response fund. However, he said, Pakistan will cash in on all opportunities since its needs are dire.
At the UN climate conference, the country will continue to seek its rightful share in climate funds, highlight western hypocrisy, fight against red tape and make a case for ease of allocation and drawdowns from the loss and damage fund.</p><small>2025-11-05 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0522330363ae50a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953329/putin-orders-proposals-on-possible-russian-nuclear-test' target='_blank'><strong>Putin orders proposals on possible Russian nuclear test</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his top officials on Wednesday to draft proposals for a possible test of nuclear weapons, something Moscow has not done since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
The order — responding to President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the United States would resume testing — was a further signal that the two countries with the world’s largest nuclear arsenals are rapidly nearing a step that could sharply escalate geopolitical tensions.
“I am instructing the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry … the special services and relevant civilian agencies to do everything possible to collect additional information on the issue, analyse it at the Security Council and make agreed proposals on the possible start of work on the preparation of nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said in televised remarks.
Russia-US relations have deteriorated sharply in the past few weeks as Trump, frustrated with a lack of progress towards ending the war in Ukraine, has cancelled a planned summit with Putin and imposed sanctions on Russia for the first time since returning to the White House in January.
Putin issued his instruction at a meeting of his Security Council, where parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin departed from the official agenda of transport safety to ask how Moscow would respond to Trump’s plans to carry out US nuclear testing for the first time in 33 years.
The question, though meant to appear spontaneous, triggered a series of clearly prepared interventions.
Top officials urgent swift Russian response to US decision
Defence Minister Andrei Belousov told Putin that recent US remarks and actions meant it was “advisable to prepare for full-scale nuclear tests” immediately.
Russia’s Arctic testing site at Novaya Zemlya could host such tests at short notice, Belousov added.
General Valery Gerasimov, head of the General Staff, told Putin: “If we do not take appropriate measures now, time and opportunities for a timely response to the actions of the United States will be lost, since the time required to prepare for nuclear tests, depending on their type, ranges from several months to several years.”
No country apart from North Korea — most recently in 2017 — has carried out explosive tests of nuclear weapons in the 21st century. Security analysts say a resumption of testing by any of the world’s nuclear powers would be destabilising, as it would likely trigger a similar response by the others.
“Action-reaction cycle at its best. No one needs this, but we might get there regardless,” Andrey Baklitskiy, senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, posted on X.
 






Russia and the US are by far the biggest nuclear powers by numbers of warheads, followed by China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea, according to the Federation of American Scientists.
No deadline set for drafting proposals on nuclear testing
State news agency TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying Putin had set no specific deadline for officials to draft the requested proposals.
“In order to come to a conclusion about the advisability of beginning preparations for such tests, it will take exactly as much time as it takes for us to fully understand the intentions of the United States of America,” Peskov said.
Trump has yet to clarify whether the resumption he ordered last week referred to nuclear-explosive testing or to flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles.
Russia last month tested its new Burevestnik cruise missile, which is nuclear-powered and designed to carry a nuclear warhead. It also held nuclear launch drills and tested a nuclear-powered Poseidon super-torpedo.
Testing delivery systems for nuclear weapons does not involve a nuclear explosion. Such blasts were regularly staged by the nuclear powers for decades during the Cold War, with devastating environmental consequences that campaigners fear could be unleashed once again if explosive tests resume.

According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
Addressing the National Assembly today, the PTI chairman spoke about the proposed amendment, remarking that when the 26th Amendment was being passed, the PTI “made great efforts” with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
“Maybe this time we won’t need to visit his (Fazl) home, or sit with you in committee,” Gohar said, directly addressing the deputy speaker, who was chairing today’s session. “We will raise our voice against it as it is an attack on the House.”
Gohar added: “Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs.”
 


The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
“Amending the Constitution is this House’s right, and in this House, it is the right of those exact people who have the people’s mandate,” Gohar said. “Our democracy is very fragile; the people have no faith in the courts.”
He told the deputy speaker that when the 18th Amendment was passed in 2010, it was “passed with consensus and unity with the people”.
“The world acknowledged and celebrated it,” Gohar said. “However, when you presented the 26th Amendment, you brought 56 amendments, which were reduced to 25, then 18. We strongly opposed four of those amendments, including the constitutional bench, the tenure of judges and the preservation of the Election Commission.
“This is a time when the nation is very divided; tensions are high, terrorism is on the rise, the deficit is rising and people cannot bear further problems. Please, be concerned about Pakistan’s security.”
27th amendment not meant to rollback 18th amendment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
Responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th amendment.
He denounced the attempts to make the 27th amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.
He said there was no plan to take over the control of educational institutions and education boards in the provinces. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he remarked.
Chaudhry said no step that weakened the federation, provinces and the relationship between them would be taken. “The purpose is to improve governance and bolster defence and strengthen the relationship between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked.
He said allies and all stakeholders would be taken on board and matters regarding the National Finance Commission award would also be decided through consultation.
He regretted that the 26th Amendment had also been dubbed as an attack on the independence of the judiciary. He noted that a separate constitutional court would help reduce the backlog.
The minister pointed out that the establishment of the constitutional court had been agreed upon in the Charter of Democracy signed between the PML-N and PPP in 2006.
He said amendments to the Constitution required a two-thirds majority and not consensus. He said the spirit of the Constitution would be followed.
About the demand for the KP chief minister’s meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he said there was a procedure under the jail manual. He said Imran’s family members and counsels kept meeting him.
PTI submits resolution in NA
A resolution was submitted by PTI members in the National Assembly to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran Khan, with PTI members signing the resolution.
“This House affirms that consultation between elected representatives and their political leadership is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy,” stated the resolution.
Recognising that lmran remains the head of the largest political party in the KP Assembly, the resolution said that the CM, as the constitutional head of the provincial government, “must be able to consult his leader on matters of governance and public mandate”.
“This House considers the denial of such access a violation of democratic
norms and an affront to the constitutional spirit that upholds dialogue and accountability,” it said.
Through the resolution, the PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the orders of the Islamabad High Court pertaining to the CM’s meeting with Imran in letter and spirit.
“This House further declares that such a meeting shall constitute an official
and legitimate consultation between the Chief Executive of the Province and the Leader of the largest parliamentary party, consistent with the principles of representative democracy and federal comity,” the resolution stated.
Last Thursday, CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the fourth time since assuming office.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister in October.</p><small>2025-11-05 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05202155dceb79e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953320/islamabad-atc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-omar-ayub-asad-qaiser-shibli-faraz-5-other-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues arrest warrants for Omar Ayub, Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, 5 other PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for eight PTI leaders, including Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub and Ali Nawaz Awan, in a case registered under terrorism provisions.
Today’s hearing was presided over by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, with none of the PTI leaders appearing before the court despite being repeatedly summoned.
Expressing displeasure over their continued absence, the judge ordered their arrest and directed authorities to produce them before November 11. The hearing was subsequently adjourned until the next date.
The case was registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) against the PTI leaders under relevant sections of the anti-terrorism act with charges of involvement in activities falling within the ambit of terrorism-related offences.
Non-bailable arrest warrants for Gandapur
In a separate development, Additional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Baloch issued non-bailable arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the audio leak case.
The judge expressed anger over Gandapur’s failure to appear for indictment proceedings, noting that neither he nor his legal representative attended the hearing.
The court had fixed the proceedings for indictment; however, the process could not be completed due to Gandapur’s absence. The judge postponed the hearing and adjourned the case until December 5, directing the police to arrest Gandapur and produce him before the court.
The case against Gandapur was registered at the Golra Police Station after an audio leak surfaced in which he was purportedly heard asking about the number of weapons, licences and people for a PTI protest.
The recording reportedly prompted a police investigation into the nature and intent of the conversation.</p><small>2025-11-05 15:48</small></div><hr>
