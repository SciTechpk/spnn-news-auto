Earlier this month, the Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GB-EPA) recommended a five-year ban on the construction and expansion of hotels on three lakes in Hunza.
Last month, the GB administration imposed a fine of Rs1.5 million on a hotel for allegedly dumping sewage waste into Attabad Lake.
The development came a day after a foreign tourist and vlogger named George Buckley posted a video on his Instagram page, claiming that sewage water was being pumped out by the hotel into the Attabad Lake.
A notification by the office of the Hunza Division Deputy Commissioner, dated July 11, available with Dawn.com, said, “Accordingly, issuance of any new No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for construction or expansion of
commercial or residential structures is hereby suspended with immediate effect and until further orders, in the following areas”.
The notification specified that no new constructions or extensions would be allowed in the Attabad and Borit lake areas, and a complete ban would be imposed on construction near the Duiker lake owing to “fragile mountain ecology and limited carrying capacity.”
A separate notification by the Baltistan Division Deputy Commissioner ordered to, “Impose a region-wide moratorium on new construction of hotels/motels in ecologically sensitive areas until full compliance with the Ecologically Sensitive and Critical Areas Rules 2023 is verified.”
Earlier, in a July 4th letter addressed to the Baltistan division commissioner, the GB-EPA identified uncontrolled hotel construction activity in central Skardu and surrounding areas, Upper Kachura and Lower Kachura Lake vicinities, Hargeisa Nullah, Bashoo Nullah and Meadows, and Chook or Zookh Nullah near Kachura as areas of concern.
It also identified tourism hotspots in Shigar, Kharmang, and Ghanche districts.
In a letter addressed to the Hunza DC dated July 1, the GB-EPA recommended an “Immediate halt to new hotel constructions in central Hunza lacking proper wastewater systems and a five-year moratorium on all hotel-related construction and expansion in central Hunza, Duikar, Attabad, and Borit Lake[s]”.
The letter also called for a complete ban on construction along the banks of Borit Lake, with strict regulation of boating and its notification as an eco-tourism destination to protect its ecological function.
The recommendations state that environmental problems are becoming critical due to hotels built on the culturally important lakes of Attabad, Duiker, and Borit in central Hunza.
According to the letter, a recent investigation into improper disposal of sewage by hotels had revealed facts of unorganised and shoddy construction and also identified shortcomings such as inadequate wastewater discharge systems and construction defects.
The report said that this unregulated and unsupervised development is compromising public health, freshwater resources, and sustainable development of the tourism sector, and is causing destruction to the ecosystem.
It further stated that the sewage disposal system of hotels is outdated, ineffective and low capacity, resulting in water channels and the Hunza River being directly polluted.
The report has disclosed that when the drinking water was tested in this poor situation, sewage contamination was confirmed, posing the risks of typhoid, dysentery and hepatitis.
According to the report, the widespread use of diesel-powered generators by hotels is also causing air pollution, which is posing a respiratory hazard to tourists. It added that this practice is contrary to the concept of a clean, environmentally friendly place.
The report also shed light on the situation of Duiker Lake. Due to the uncontrolled construction of hotels, the environment at this lake is rapidly deteriorating.
The agency expressed fear that inadequate sewage and poor human waste disposal arrangements are damaging the fragile mountain environment of the area.
 
 

The report recommends a five-year ban on all new construction and hotel expansion around Attabad Lake to help protect water quality, maintain ecological balance, and protect it from natural disasters, especially floods and landslides, as well as ensure the constant availability of clean drinking water.
The agency recommends that boating and tourist activities in the lake should be restricted for this purpose. The report says that the lake is a protected area under Section 172 of the Forest Act 2019. It is an important habitat for migratory and endangered bird species.
“However, boating activities here are creating a disturbing situation for nesting and movement of birds in this place, which is seriously damaging the international importance and ecological functions of the lake,” the letter said.
The GB-EPA called for a transition to eco-friendly, community-based tourism is urgently needed. This model ensures:
“With responsible tourism policies, Hunza can become a global benchmark for sustainable mountain tourism,” the letter said.</p><small>2025-07-14 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1412581433d0f05.jpg?r=135720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924137/at-least-6-die-as-heavy-rains-continue-to-wreak-havoc-across-kp' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6 die as heavy rains continue to wreak havoc across KP</strong></a><br><p>At least six people have died, including four children, while one person was injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours continue to lash parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Monday.
Last week, PDMA alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.
Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.
 
 

According to the report, a total of three houses were partially damaged due to rain and flash floods. The PDMA has directed the relevant administrations to provide immediate assistance to the bereaved families and remain on high alert in case of an emergency.
According to the KP PDMA spokesperson, the authority was in touch with all district administrations and relief agencies. He added that PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre was fully functional and urged the public to report any untoward incident on their helpline 1700.
The PDMA, in its countrywide weather advisory, warned that there was a risk of flooding in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Muree, Galiat, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Swabi, Nowshera, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, DG Khan, North East Punjab, Balochistan and Kashmir as heavy rains continue.
According to the report, there was a risk of landslide due to the rain in KP, Murree, Galiat, Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, which may disrupt traffic movement.
PDMA advised citizens to exercise caution, as damaged infrastructure could pose a threat to public safety.
Low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar may face flooding as well, the report said.
In the past 24 hours, the highest rainfall was recorded in Punjab with Okara receiving 72 millimetres of rain while Sahiwal recorded 66mm, Dera Ghazi Khan City 51mm, Bahawalnagar 36mm, Kot Addu 33mm, Gujranwala 12mm, Noorpur Thal 27mm, Karr (Leh) 23mm, Murree 22, Khanpur 13, Bhakkar 09, Islamabad (Bokra 9mm, Airport 7mm, Saidpur 4mm), Rawalpindi (Kachri 12mm, Chaklala 6mm, Peerewadahi 7mm), Jhang 6mm, Attock and Hafizabad 4mm, TT Singh and Sheikhupura 2mm.

The weather in other parts of the country remained hot and humid. The maximum temperature recorded was 43 degrees Celsius in Jacobabad, Rohri, Dadu, Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh and Dalbandin in Balochistan.
Heavy rain predicted till July 17 countrywide: PMD
Meanwhile, heavy rain is predicted till July 17 countrywide, according to a weather advisory issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to the Met Office, a low-pressure area is presently located over northwest Madhya Pradesh in India and is likely to affect Pakistan, during the next 24 to 72 hours
“Under the influence of this weather system, strong monsoon currents are expected to penetrate the central and upper parts, while a westerly wave is also present over the upper parts of the country,” the PMD said.
 






Rain-windstorm/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir from the night of July 14th to the 17th, while rain-windstorm/thunderstorm is expected in Gilgit-Baltistan as well, with occasional gaps.
In KP, rain-windstorm/thundershower with scattered heavy falls is expected in multiple districts, including Peshawar and Abbottabad.
“Rain-windstorm/thundershower with scattered heavy falls is expected” in Punjab as well as the capital.
In Balochistan, rain-windstorms/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in the northeastern and southern parts of the province, including Quetta, till July 16th.
For Sindh, rain-windstorm/thundershower is expected in Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Jacobabad, Khairpur and Shaheed Benazirabad from July 14th to the 16th with occasional gaps.
Light rain is also expected in Karachi, according to the advisory.

Landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat, AJK and GB as well, according to the advisory. Torrential rain may damage standing crops in Punjab, KP and Kashmir
111 monsoon-related deaths since late June: NDMA
The monsoon rains have been linked to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they arrived in late June, according to data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Data between June 26 and July 14 showed that electrocution was the leading cause of fatalities, followed by flash floods. In late June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
In its latest report, the NDMA said 111 people, including 53 children, have been killed, with the highest number of deaths in Punjab.</p><small>2025-07-14 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1418214114a1912.png?r=190755' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924165/trilateral-working-group-in-the-offing-between-pakistan-iran-and-iraq-to-prevent-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Trilateral working group in the offing between Pakistan, Iran and Iraq to prevent ‘illegal migration’</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday announced that he and his counterparts in and Iran and Iraq will form a trilateral working group to prevent illegal migration under the guise of pilgrimage, Radio Pakistan reported.
Earlier this month, the government, during a meeting, decided that under the new measures, the traditional Salar System for zaireen (pilgrims) will be abolished and replaced with a zaireen group organisers model. From 2026 onwards, pilgrims will only be allowed to travel under registered organisers.
Speaking at a trilateral conference of the interior ministers of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq in Tehran, Naqvi told journalists the conference agreed to take all possible measures to facilitate zaireen travelling to Iran and Iraq.

“We had a great and good discussion,” Naqvi said. “We will have a joint working group between the three countries so we can have better coordination.
“The most important thing to acknowledge is that there are several million people who go to Iraq, and this is a big credit for the Iraqi interior ministry. Every year, they host them without flaw and every year it gets much better.”
According to Radio Pakistan, the working group, comprising representatives from all three countries would be established to streamline and support the process of travel for pilgrimages.
 


During the trilateral conference, Naqvi said that the registration process for zaireen group organisers has already commenced. He said from January 1 next year, Pakistani zaireen will travel to Iraq exclusively under registered group organisers, rather than individually.
“We will not be allowing any Pakistani to leave Iraq without zaireen group organisers,” Naqvi said. “We will be registering people who are allowed to take the groups to Iraq and they are bound to bring back all the people who are going with them.”
According to the interior minister, these groups will be responsible for ensuring the safe return of pilgrims travelling to Iraq.
“Only individuals issued a special visa by the embassy will be permitted to travel independently,” he added.
“The illegal issue that Iraq is facing, people who are overstaying there … who have started working there, we need to stop this. I am totally against all those who are staying illegally.”
Naqvi said Iraq and Iran are fully aligned with Pakistan’s new system and reaffirmed their commitment to jointly curbing irregular travel and overstays. He also assured his counterparts of Islamabad’s full cooperation in matters concerning zaireen.
He expressed gratitude to the governments of Iraq and Iran for their continued care and support of Pakistani pilgrims, who “number in the millions”.</p><small>2025-07-14 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14172431b8b0c70.jpg?r=172821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924162/ptis-zulfi-bukhari-to-testify-before-us-congress-body-on-political-repression-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Zulfi Bukhari to testify before US Congress body on ‘political repression’ in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, a former aide to ex-premier Imran Khan, is set to offer testimony on “political repression” in Pakistan before the United States Congress’ Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, it emerged on Monday.
According to its website, the bipartisan commission was established in 2008 and is charged with promoting, defending and advocating for international human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.
The commission’s hearing notice states that the session will take place on Tuesday (tomorrow) at 3:30pm (12:30am PKT on Wednesday) and will “examine the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists, and its actions to control media communications and prevent free and fair elections in Pakistan”. The session is open to the public and the media.
“Many date the current phase of repression in Pakistan to 2022, when, with the involvement of the Pakistan military, popular Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and soon after, arrested, convicted of corruption and imprisoned,” the notice read.
“Parliamentary elections in February 2024 were, according to the US State Department, marked by ‘undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly’, as well as ‘electoral violence, and restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms’,” it added.
 






The commission provided a list of witnesses who would provide testimony during Tuesday’s hearing. Besides Bukhari, the list includes Amnesty International’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; Perseus Strategies Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini.
A press release from the commission’s co-chairman, Republican Congressman Christopher Smith, who will chair the session, said the meeting would “discuss the government of Pakistan’s ongoing political repression, the US response, and offer recommendations for Congress”.
Bukhari announced that he would be testifying before the commission in a post on X dated July 9, expressing gratitude to the commission’s co-chairs, Democratic Congressman James McGovern and Smith, for the opportunity to testify.
“I will be highlighting the arbitrary detention of Imran Khan, his wife, and other political prisoners, as well as the erosion of democracy, the undermining of the rule of law, and escalating crackdowns on freedom of expression in Pakistan,” he wrote.
Genser replied to Bukhari’s post, writing, “I am honoured and grateful to be able to testify alongside you before the [Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission] on Pakistan, human rights and the situation of Imran Khan and all political prisoners being held by the current regime.”
 






Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is standing at a crossroads amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners.
Titled ‘Free speech and public interest journalism under siege’, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has also expressed deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.
In a statement issued earlier this month, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.</p><small>2025-07-14 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14184046bedc8df.jpg?r=185938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924167/avoiding-trade-curbs-vital-for-normalisation-of-ties-india-tells-china' target='_blank'><strong>Avoiding trade curbs vital for normalisation of ties, India tells China</strong></a><br><p>India and China must resolve friction along their border, pull back troops and avoid “restrictive trade measures” to normalise their relationship, India’s foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday.
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met Wang Yi in Beijing during his first trip to the country since 2020, when a deadly border clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff and damaged ties until a thaw began in October, when they agreed to step back.
“Good progress” made by the countries in the past nine months for normalisation of relations is a result of the resolution of friction along their border, Jaishankar told Wang.
 






India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. They fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962, and talks over the decades to settle the border dispute have made slow progress.
Last month, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a “permanent solution” to the border dispute, seen as a new push by New Delhi for a conclusive outcome.
“It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” Jaishankar said, adding that it was also critical that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks be avoided to foster mutually beneficial cooperation.
 
 

The minister was speaking against the backdrop of Beijing’s restrictions in recent months on supplies of critical minerals such as rare earth magnets and machinery for the manufacturing of high-tech goods.
India holds the world’s fifth-largest rare earth reserves, but its domestic output remains underdeveloped.
There was no immediate Chinese readout of the talks between Jaishankar and Wang.
Jaishankar, who is in China to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng earlier in the day, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
India and China should steadily advance practical cooperation and respect each other’s concerns, Han told Jaishankar, Xinhua said.</p><small>2025-07-14 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14182343b2bdf3c.png?r=185434' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924164/additional-fbr-powers-have-nothing-to-do-with-income-tax-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Additional FBR powers have ‘nothing to do with income tax’: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday said that the additional powers granted to the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) had nothing to do with income tax.
The expanded enforcement powers for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.
Addressing the matter in a press conference in Karachi today, Aurangzeb said, “I think there is something to understand about what the existing law was at the time. The first thing to understand is that it has no relation to income tax. This whole issue is a sales tax fraud issue.”
The finance minister added that in the original law, Inland Revenue Service officers had the authority to arrest, and it was the opinion of the government that additional safeguards should be developed in this regard.
He described the lengthy process of taking this bill into the standing committees and the “detailed discussions” on each clause in the Senate finance committee, the National Assembly and finally the parliament before its approval, including feedback from the Pakistan Bar Council’s vice chairman.
Aurangzeb requested that people read the new safeguards that were developed, pointing out that of the 10-12 sections, six of them addressed sales tax fraud “because they are more serious offences vis a vis tax fraud versus the other six”.
He also added that the power would only be exercised if the value of the sales tax fraud was over Rs50 million, and that it would be exercised on a commissioner level, with the permissions being acquired from a three-member FBR board.
“This is not something parliament has approved without thinking it through,” he added. “A lot of thought has gone into it.”
 


The finance minister also highlighted two areas in which banks could lend further support and assistance in achieving sustainable growth in the economy, focusing on the areas of privatisation and the restructuring and revival of sick units. He said that there were currently 24 state-owned enterprises that were given to the privatisation commission, adding that “banks can play a very important role in this, and they should”.
He stressed that there were many possible external reasons for an industry to struggle, such as macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, inflation and high interest rates, which impair their ability to pay. Aurangzeb called for banks to join with sponsors to revive the sick units, saying that this would be “a very big pillar of [Minister-in-Charge for Industries and Production] Haroon Akhtar’s industrial policy (…) where banks can play a very major role”.
“I am glad that the banking sector in Pakistan is stepping up and helping the economy to grow as we go forward,” he said.
Aurangzeb added that macroeconomic stability “is not an end in itself”.
 
 

“It was a very big issue that [foreign investors’] dividends were stuck here, their profits were unable to be repatriated, there was difficulty in opening their letters of credit,” he said, expressing appreciation for the acknowledgement of the “substantial improvement” in the last 12-18 months.
“It is very important for a foreign investor that when they bring their capital, they have the assurance that ‘we can take this back at any time (…) without any prohibitions’. So to me, this is basic hygiene,” he said. “If existing investors are not satisfied, then bringing further investment in the future is very difficult. So I think we’ve come a long way from that perspective.”
Aurangzeb also stated that he had invited Faysal Bank President and CEO Yousuf Hussain and Communications Minister Abdul Aleem to Islamabad, partly to see the FBR transformation for themselves, which involved the simplification of processes and automation of procedures, and partly to bring their own outstanding issues for discussion with the whole team.
“It is very important to re-establish the credibility and trust of our tax authority in this country,” he said.
The finance minister also requested that everyone present at the conference look at the new simplified salaried class tax form that had been published on the FBR website and provide feedback as to whether it was “simplified enough”.
“The first form that used to be filled out had about 800 rows, and complicated codes,” he said, adding that now there were eight screens in total.
He added, “We have only started with the salaried class. We will take this to small traders, and then we will take it to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). So that whatever we can facilitate in simplifying the process, we will.”
Aurangzeb added that, as of his information from two days prior, about Rs75bn in sales tax refunds had been given within this month alone, and that meetings were happening regularly for the purpose of taking the country’s economic stability towards sustainable growth, stressing that his focus was on sustainability.
“What finance minister does not want a big increase in growth?” he said, but warned against repeating “boom and bust cycles” in the country, where a “sugar rush” of chasing consumption-led growth would lead the country “back to square one”.
Addressing a structural solution to economic issues, he said, “My personal opinion is that whatever things we can deregulate, we should,” referring to the success of rice and maize crops.
“Wherever the government gets a credit, that is where there are issues,” he said. “So over a period of time, I think we should leave it to the private sector and demand and supply, and I think that to me is a structural solution.”</p><small>2025-07-14 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1417581634716e7.jpg?r=175931' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924163/air-india-ceo-says-probe-into-ahmedabad-crash-raises-new-questions' target='_blank'><strong>Air India CEO says probe into Ahmedabad crash raises new questions</strong></a><br><p>A preliminary investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 passenger jet last month that killed 260 people raises additional questions about the incident, and the investigation is far from over, Air India’s CEO said in a memo on Monday.
The preliminary investigation report released by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before the crash of the Boeing.
In a staff memo reviewed by Reuters, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the report had “triggered a new round of speculation in the media … Unsurprisingly, it provided both greater clarity and opened additional questions”.
He added: “The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations, so I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.”
The memo said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff. All but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground were killed.
According to the AAIB report, in the flight’s final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel.
 
 

“The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report said. It added that the plane’s engine two fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously, but did not say how.
The preliminary report suggested no immediate action for Boeing or General Electric, whose engines were fitted on the aircraft.
Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA), which represents Indian pilots at the Montreal-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, has rejected any presumption of pilot error and called for a “fair, fact-based inquiry”.
“The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status,” Campbell said in his memo.
ALPA India, another pilots’ body with 800 members, also accused the probe agency of “secrecy” surrounding the investigation, saying “suitably qualified personnel” were not involved in it.
“We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,” ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement issued on Saturday.
The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) said it was “deeply disturbed by speculative narratives … particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide”.
“There is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage,” it said in a statement on Sunday, adding, “it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved.”
 
 

“To casually suggest pilot suicide without verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it said.
The ICPA was referring to a number of aviation experts suggesting engine fuel control switches can only be moved deliberately and manually.
The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.
Air India has come under heightened scrutiny on multiple fronts following the crash.
On July 4, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it would investigate budget unit Air India Express, after a Reuters report revealed the airline failed to promptly replace engine parts on an Airbus A320 as mandated, and falsified records to indicate compliance.
US FAA, Boeing notify fuel switch locks are safe, document, sources say
The US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing have privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed, and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The FAA’s Continued Airworthiness Notification on July 11 came after a preliminary report into the crash, which raised questions over engine fuel cutoff switches.
The FAA’s notification to Civil Aviation Authorities, seen by Reuters, said: “although the fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, the FAA does not consider this issue to be an unsafe condition that would warrant an Airworthiness Directive on any Boeing airplane models, including the Model 787.”
When asked for comment, the FAA said it did not have anything to add beyond the notification.
Boeing also referred to the FAA notification in a Multi-Operator-Message sent to the airlines in the past few days, which said the planemaker is not recommending any action, two of the sources with direct knowledge said.
When asked for comment, Boeing referred Reuters’ questions to the FAA.
The preliminary investigation report into the crash referred to a 2018 FAA advisory, which recommended, but did not mandate, operators of several Boeing models, including the 787, to inspect the locking feature of the fuel cutoff switches to ensure it could not be moved accidentally.
The report said Air India had said it had not carried out the FAA’s suggested inspections, as the FAA 2018 advisory was not a mandate. But it also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash.
The report noted “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines.”
ALPA India, in a letter posted on X, said the preliminary investigation report referred to the 2018 FAA advisory “concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction”.
 






Two US safety experts said on Saturday they backed ALPA India’s request to be observers in the probe, but said the investigation report did not suggest a bias toward pilot error.
John Cox, a pilot and former ALPA US representative, said AAIB’s report seemed objective and fair.
The Indian aviation regulator ordered Indian airlines to examine fuel switches on Boeing aircraft, including the 787 and 737 models, to check for any malfunctions in their locking mechanism.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had issued the order after several Indian and international airlines began making their own inspections of fuel switches.
Reuters earlier reported that Air India Group had begun inspecting fuel switches on its Boeing 787 and 737 aircraft over the weekend and had discovered no problems yet.</p><small>2025-07-14 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14165451d673a8f.png?r=165548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924147/man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-woman-for-refusing-marriage-arrested-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man accused of trying to kill woman for refusing marriage arrested in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A man accused of trying to kill a woman by shooting her as she refused to marry him was arrested in Karachi and was found in possession of illegal weapons, the Ittehad Town police said on Monday.
However, the woman remained safe and a case under Sections 324 (attempt to commit intentional murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was registered at the Ittehad Town police station.
As soon as the case was registered, a police team led by Station House Officer Inspector Rao Shabbir Ahmed, acting on the information of a special informant, successfully arrested the accused. The police team also found him in possession of illegal weapons. A case under Section 23(1)-A of the Arms Act was also registered in this connection.
In 2021, he had allegedly attempted to murder his ex-wife by throwing acid on her. A case was registered under Sections 336-A (hurt caused by corrosive substance) and 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at Saeedabad police station.
A firing case, in which the accused along with other unidentified persons attacked someone, was previously registered against him at Ittehad Town police station under Sections 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 324 (attempt to commit intentional murder), 109 (punishment of abetment), and 34 (common intention).
There has been a recorded rise in the cases of violence against women throughout the country in recent years, with the Sindh High Court noting that the police treat these cases in a non-serious way.
In March, a man was held for killing his wife outside Karachi Malir court.

The benchmark KSE 100 index surged by 2202.77 points, or up by 1.64 per cent, to close at 136,502.53 points. The stock market reached its highest intraday level of 136,841.49 points around 3:28pm.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction as the stock market surged to cross the all-time high level.
According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, he said the “significant achievement by the PSX is a clear reflection of the business community’s growing confidence in Pakistan’s economy”.
“The recent positive economic indicators are a testament to his government’s policies moving in the right direction,” he emphasised, reiterating that providing a business-friendly environment remains the government’s top priority.“
He said the country had moved from economic stability towards the path of economic growth, adding that the government of Pakistan was working tirelessly for national development and public welfare.
“This positive outlook follows a period of concerted efforts to stabilise the economy and implement structural reforms, which appear to be gaining traction and restoring investor trust,” he said, per the statement.
The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.
A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.
Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.
The auto sector further supported market gains. As per the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales in June rose 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month to 21,773 units. Full-year FY25 sales grew 43pc to 148,000 units, buoyed by pre-buying ahead of a proposed GST increase on smaller vehicles.</p><small>2025-07-14 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14163932c01db5b.jpg?r=164139' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924156/pakistani-fishers-feel-the-impact-of-iran-israel-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani fishers feel the impact of Iran-Israel war</strong></a><br><p>“When our boats are stranded onshore, our kitchens remain empty,” says Lateefa Nasir. “My children haven’t been to school for a month and we live on loans now.”
Nasir is a member and beneficiary of the Ormara Cooperative Society, a local NGO advocating for the improvement of fishers’ livelihoods and welfare. She and her family live in Ormara, a town in Gwadar district, along the coast of Pakistan’s south-western Balochistan province. Her husband is a fisher and like many fishing households in the area they are in crisis due to the Iran-Israel conflict.
The war has led Pakistan to close its border with Iran, disrupting both the inflow of fuel and the export of fish. This double blow has crippled fishing communities already suffering from the impacts of climate change and overfishing.
Balochistan boasts an approximately 770-kilometre coastline along the Arabian Sea which plays a significant role in the country’s fisheries.
Allaudin Kakkar, a senior official from the Balochistan Fisheries and Coastal Development Department, told Dialogue Earth that the province’s fishers contribute around 340,000 tonnes of catch annually, with a market value of nearly Rs19.9 billion ($70.1 million). This includes high-value species such as tuna, Spanish mackerel, croaker, Indian oil sardine, and Indian mackerel. With over 16,000 registered and 6,000 smaller, unregistered boats operating in its waters, fishing provides livelihoods to tens of thousands of families in the province.
“Despite this valuable contribution, the sector remains poorly regulated, underfunded, and deeply exposed to external shocks,” says Kakkar.
 

Before the conflict, fishers of Indian mackerel and other fish in Balochistan often powered their boats using illegally imported, easily accessible Iranian fuel (Image: Abdul Rahim)

Such a shock arrived when tensions escalated between Iran and Israel during the 12-day war. Before the conflict, fishers relied heavily on Iranian petrol and diesel, which although imported illegally by smugglers, was both affordable and easily accessible. With the closure of the borders, which remains despite a ceasefire, this supply chain collapsed. Now, fuel is either unavailable or sold at Rs180-200 ($0.63-0.70) per litre instead of the Rs150 ($0.53) it cost before, notes Shams ul Haq Kalmati, chair of the Gwadar Chamber of Commerce.
A local source told Dialogue Earth that daily imports of Iranian fuel into Balochistan have plummeted from 600,000 to 140,000 barrels. Other local sources say that before the border closed, more than 300 large oil depots, 1,000 pumps and 2,000 shops were almost exclusively selling Iranian fuel in the port city of Gwadar and surrounding areas, with only two pumps that sold Pakistani petrol.
Despite these developments, Gwadar deputy commissioner Hamood Ur Rehman maintains that there is no major problem and the situation has normalised.
Impacts on industry
“This crisis is not only economic, it’s ecological as well,” warns Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser on marine issues at WWF-Pakistan.
He fears that the sudden halt in fishing due to the fuel-price increase, especially the catching of top predatory fish such as tuna, could disturb the balance of the marine ecosystem.
The current geopolitical tension is severely impacting Pakistan’s coastal and pelagic fisheries, particularly tuna, says Khan. Every year, Pakistani fishers harvest approximately 50 to 60 tonnes of tuna and tuna-like species, most of which is sold directly to Iran. Although this export is illegal, like the fuel that moves in the opposite direction, the fish fetch high prices over the border.

Balochistan tuna is generally not high enough quality for most international markets, says Khan, leaving Iran one of the few places willing to pay well for it. Iran offers prices ranging from Rs300 to 700 ($1.06-2.47) per kilogramme, and the total annual value of this export trade is estimated at around Rs15-35m ($52,900-123,300).
“Without access to the Iranian market, the entire tuna fishery is on the brink of collapse, threatening both income and employment for the affected communities,” says Khan.
Tahir Rasheed agrees. He is the CEO of Balochistan Rural Support Programme, an NGO that supports rural poor and marginalised people in the province.
“Most of the tuna and other commercial [fish] are exported from Balochistan to Iran through barter trade, where fishers often exchange their catch, including tuna, for petrol and diesel,” says Rasheed. The barter trade typically operates through Iranian speedboats that are registered in both Iran and Pakistan. They obtain fish from Pakistani fishers by journeying offshore to locations around the border of the two countries, as well as landing sites in Balochistan such as Gwader and Jiwani.
Already poor fishers now poorer
In addition to tuna sales, the swim bladders of some fish caught in the region are sought after as a delicacy in East and Southeast Asian markets. With fuel prices surging due to the border closure leading to higher land and sea transportation costs, thousands of kilogrammes of high-value fresh catch are going unsold. The domestic market is too weak to absorb the surplus, and cold-storage facilities are extremely limited, especially in remote coastal towns, notes Nakuda Dad Karim, a fisher from Gwadar. A lack of ways to preserve fish for exports — such as canning or freezing — means the crisis is rippling through the Balochistan economy.

“Without formal trade routes or preservation infrastructure, the entire supply chain is collapsing,” says Kalmati. “Ice factories, fish transporters, fish-processing owners, boat mechanics … everyone is affected. This isn’t just a fisheries crisis. It’s a full-blown economic emergency.”
All this has further depressed the price for fishers’ catches.
“I have been going to sea for over 40 years,” says Karim. “But I have never seen it this bad. We used to spend Rs15,000 ($53) on a trip and return with enough fish to make a small profit. Fuel cost alone has now exceeded Rs30,000 ($106) and we can’t even sell our catch at a good price. Each trip feels like gambling our future.”
Many like Nakuda Dad Karim are now struggling to feed their families. His younger son, a crew member on the same boat as him, is considering moving to construction work, where prospects are better.
Jumait Jangir Baloch is a fisher and “mole holder” — someone who is certified as a fish trader by the government — in Gwadar.
“Some of us have stopped going to sea. It’s not worth the loss,” he says. “We used to sell Spanish mackerel, barracuda, large croakers, and tuna to Iranian buyers. They paid us good rates in cash. Now, no one is buying, and even local traders offer half the price.”
On land, women suffer
While those who go to sea are mainly men, women are also affected by the crisis.
“Women here don’t fish, but we grade, dry and sell them,” explains Haleema Baloch from Gwadar, who does such work. “With [business] down, we are losing our wages.”
Fuel prices and the collapsing export market for catches have stopped many boats going to sea, depriving coastal communities of the cheaper fish they relied on for food and jobs.
Talib Katchi from the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, an NGO advocating for fisher communities, tells Dialogue Earth that communities are losing sustenance as well as money. Women who work as independent fish retailers “can no longer buy affordable species like sardines and Indian mackerel, cutting off food access for low-income communities”, he says.
“Women in fish processing are facing wage cuts, and small vendors can’t find cheap fish to sell,” adds Sami Gull, general secretary of the Fisherfolk Cooperative Society, Gwadar. “The poor can’t afford poultry or meat either. If this continues, it could trigger a serious food security and nutrition crisis.”

Kalmati, of the Gwadar Chamber of Commerce, wants federal and provincial governments to intervene swiftly with fuel subsidies and reopen the border to properly regulated trade.
Provincial official Kakkar acknowledges the severity of the crisis. “We’ve submitted a proposal for a Rs380m ($1.34m) endowment fund to support emergency fuel subsidies, welfare schemes, and compensation for affected fishermen,” he says.
Rasheed, from the Balochistan Rural Support Programme, says that with cold-storage and canning facilities and other modern infrastructure, the province could transform its fishing industry into a lucrative export sector. This would reduce dependency on bartering and boost the economy. But “we must act quickly”, he says.
Balochistan’s fishing industry, once a pillar of its coastal economy, teeters on the edge. Without swift and coordinated action, its collapse could reverberate far beyond its shores.

Trump, seeking to negotiate an end to the three-year war, has expressed growing impatience with the Kremlin leader and over the weekend announced a fresh weapons cache for Ukraine.
“We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,” Trump said on Sunday, referring to the air defence system. He did not specify how many weapons he would send, but added that he would make a “major statement … on Russia” on Monday, when Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte will be in Washington.
The White House has U-turned from an announcement earlier this month that it would pause some arms deliveries to Kyiv, instead announcing a new deal which would involve Nato purchasing some US weapons to send to Ukraine.
In a statement, Nato said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Rutte’s 10am (7pm PKT) Oval Office meeting on Monday will be closed to the media.
“We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they’re going to pay us 100 per cent for them,” Trump said. “It’ll be business for us.”
Trump also repeated that he was “disappointed” in Putin, as he grows increasingly exasperated with the Russian leader.
“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said on Sunday, as he returned from watching the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey.
Last week, Trump accused Putin of throwing “bullshit” at Washington on Ukraine, openly frustrated with the impasse on peace efforts.
As he began his second stint in office in January, Trump insisted he could work with the Russian leader to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, and held off on hiking sanctions, unlike Kyiv’s European allies.
But Russia has for months refused a ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine.
Trump has hinted he might be ready to slap sanctions on Moscow as momentum grows for a deterrent package in Congress. When asked about whether he would announce any levies against Russia, Trump responded: “We’re going to see what we will see tomorrow, OK?” and repeated plans to meet with Rutte.
‘Sledgehammer’
Republican senators, meanwhile, are touting a bipartisan bill that would arm Trump with a “sledgehammer” to use against Russia.
The sanctions bill would allow Trump “to go after Putin’s economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told broadcaster CBS News.
It “would give President Trump the ability to impose 500pc tariffs on any country that helps Russia,” said Graham, adding that those could include economies that purchase Russian goods like China, India or Brazil.
“This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war,” said Graham.
 


Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal were also due to meet Nato’s Rutte on Monday.
Blumenthal told CBS News they would also discuss the legally thorny issue of unlocking frozen Russian assets in Europe and the United States for access by Ukraine.
“The $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it’s time to do it,” said Blumenthal.
Zelensky said the proposed bill “is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty”.
The Kremlin has previously said that sending arms to Ukraine would only prolong the conflict.
Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and has shown little appetite for ending the conflict despite pressure from Trump.
Over the summer, Russia has escalated its offensive and advanced the front line, launching some of the largest missile and drone attacks of the war.</p><small>2025-07-14 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14154727c25a586.jpg?r=155110' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924150/no-casualties-reported-as-magnitude-67-quake-hits-offshore-eastern-indonesia' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as magnitude 6.7 quake hits offshore eastern Indonesia</strong></a><br><p>A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck on Monday off eastern Indonesia, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said, but a monitor said there was no tsunami threat.

‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family.
In a first information report (FIR) filed by a close relative of the deceased woman, it was stated that she was killed by her husband.
“The suspect thought his wife had an illicit relationship with the man, following which he killed both,” the police said.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the suspect first opened fire on the man, after which he went home and shot his wife, and then proceeded to strike her with an axe.
The FIR has been filed under Sections 302 (punishment of premeditated murder) and 324 (attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).  A search operation is underway to apprehend the suspect, who is currently on the run, the police said.
Swat police spokesperson Moin Ali said that District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan has taken notice of the incident, directing DSP Madyan Circle to investigate the matter from all possible angles.
On June 15, a couple was killed in a suspected ‘honour’ killing in KP’s Maulana Kaly Fatma area of Mardan district. On the same day, a 17-year-old boy was gunned down in KP’s Martung tehsil in the name of “honour”.
On May 26, a man allegedly gunned down three people, including a child, for ‘honour’ in KP’s Upper Dir district.
 
 

Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab.
From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to “honour” crimes in the country.
In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to similar murders.</p><small>2025-07-14 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141359539a0cb8f.png?r=140042' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924143/pti-protests-aim-to-destabilise-country-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”.
His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a movement to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was imprisoned.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he claims are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into violence after facing state repression.
Sanaullah said that Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq” (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.
“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.
Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”
He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offices against their granting of an emergency loan to Pakistan.
He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”
He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.
 
 

According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.
“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”
Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”
Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.
“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government’s, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”
The previous day, on Geo News’ programme “Naya Pakistan”, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI’s intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, “If they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?”
However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.
“If they move towards violence, the law will take its course,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-14 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1414385612c7548.jpg?r=143907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924133/cybercrime-agency-raids-illegal-call-centre-in-islamabad-arrests-five-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime agency raids illegal call centre in Islamabad, arrests five foreign nationals</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) conducted a successful raid last night on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release issued on Monday.

A first information report (FIR) was registered on Sunday by complainant Aamir Azeem Abbasi regarding a “task-based scam resulting in financial loss”.
According to the FIR, a reliable source informed that a criminal gang was operating a call centre located in Sardar Plaza, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad.
An inquiry concluded that the call centre activities were carried out “with active connivance of each other by impersonating as representatives of a fake and dubious online earning company.”
The FIR further stated “ulterior motives to extort money, contact persons of different nationalities and lure them into a dubious easy-money-making scheme.”
Equipment used in the execution of the digital scam was found and taken into possession by NCCIA Islamabad.
“The accused persons could not present any lawful justification” and confessed to working as a gang to perform electronic fraud via extortion and impersonation.“
The gang used internet downloaded and AI-generated photos and fake personas to “initiate conversations with isolated or vulnerable individuals through social media such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp through victim hunting.”
The operation, per the FIR, was a multi-tier set-up consisting of scammers that chat with victims initially, Telegram receptionists who receive collated information on the victims to lure them in for more advanced tasks, finance managers, who managed crypto accounts for receiving fraudulent funds generated via local and international scams, and “killers”, who reside in foreign countries like Cambodia and empty victims’ bank accounts under the pretext of online earning.
The FIR concluded that the accused gang extorted “huge amounts of money from local Pakistani as well as international victims by accessing their confidential information and misusing such data for extorting money. This fraudulent money is layered via cryptocurrency wallets.”
The raid follows a similar incident last week where the NCCIA claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in online fraud during a raid on a factory in Faisalabad.
Days after the arrest, a Faisalabad special court allowed a five-day physical remand of 87 suspects, including 18 women, allegedly involved in various cybercrimes, and sent 62 others to the district jail on a 14-day judicial remand, on the request of the NCCIA.
Last month, 18 suspects believed to be involved in a high-profile online scam were arrested and produced before a Karachi court. A judicial magistrate remanded them into the custody of the NCCIA for interrogation.
In May, the NCCIA, in coordination with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dutch police, arrested 21 suspects involved in cybercrime operations and digital fraud worth millions of dollars in Multan and Lahore.</p><small>2025-07-14 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14121731cc933d3.png?r=121739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915393/minimum-wage-mass-exploitation-a-crisis-of-the-pakistani-labour-force' target='_blank'><strong>Minimum wage, mass exploitation: A crisis of the Pakistani labour force</strong></a><br><p>Asadullah Khan sits on a chair outside a washed-out old building for 12 hours every day in the punishing Karachi heat. Wearing a navy blue uniform, the security guard leaves his house near Ziauddin Hospital in Clifton right after Fajr prayer to walk the 10-kilometre stretch to his workplace in Saddar. It takes him two hours every day to reach on time for a job that pays a meagre Rs25,000 each month.
By noon, the humidity forces him to take off his sweat-drenched shirt and dry it off by placing it in front of the shabby fan available in the parking area of his office building. This is also when he steals some time to cool off in front of the same fan.
At around 7 pm, it is time for him to walk another two hours back to his one-room apartment that he shares with his family of five.
“I have to pay Rs7,000 rent from my salary for the room, but we get by,” he said, with a smile, a permanent fixture on his otherwise worn face.
Asadullah is not even aware that what he is earning is 33 per cent below the minimum wage fixed by the Government of Pakistan. The federal minimum wage was set at Rs37,000 for the outgoing fiscal year of 2024-2025, according to the 2024 notification, which had increased by 15.6pc from the previous year. For the current fiscal year 2025-2026, the government decided to maintain the minimum wage at Rs37,000.
 
 

According to the Sindh Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC), over 80pc of private industrial units are not implementing the order of minimum wage.
“Around 95pc of factories do not give minimum wage to their workers,” Nasir Mansoor, General Secretary of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), told Dawn.com.
Asadullah, completely alien to his right to demand the minimum wage, said that his employer increased his salary whenever he requested it. When asked what he thought his rightful salary was, he replied: “Maybe Rs30,000?”
Pakistan is heavily dependent on its labour class economically, yet the country has not been able to give due weight and importance to the rights and interests of its labourers, according to a 2019 Sindh High Court-commissioned report.
“The ‘industry’ of a nation is always the backbone of its economy, which normally depends upon the labour class,” the report highlighted.
‘Wage theft’
Seated in a cramped, 5x5ft room with dark brown walls, where the breeze from the windows offered the only relief from Karachi’s scorching heat and humidity, Manesh Das* wore a ferozi-coloured kurta, stained with patches of brown that had almost altered its original hue. His kurta was drenched in sweat, and his brown skin glistened with it.
Das had left his family of six — his wife and children — with his parents and siblings in Tando Mohammad Khan four to five months ago, hoping to break free from the shackles of the zamindar he once worked for, who paid him only in crops, never in money. Kumar had believed that moving to the city would at least allow him to send some money back home.
But from his meagre salary of Rs15,600 received in weekly instalments — earned by sweeping roughly a one-kilometre stretch in Ranchor Line every day from 8am to 3pm — he is only able to send Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 home.
“Even going home costs almost Rs4,000 to Rs5,000, which we cannot afford,” he said.
 


Labour rights activist Naeem Sadiq, during an interview with Dawn.com, explained that the national minimum wage for unskilled workers is set at Rs37,000 for an 8-hour daily shift, for working 26 days per month (the wages slightly vary by skill level and province). If a worker puts in overtime, they are entitled to receive double their regular hourly wage.
Citing the example of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB), where Das is currently employed, Sadiq calculated approximately Rs2.4 billion in annual wage theft by the institution.
According to the rights activist, the SSWMB employs 12,000 sanitation workers. Each employee is paid approximately Rs20,000 per month, which means there was a Rs17,000 worth of stolen wages from each employee per month, entailing that each worker is owed Rs200,000 just for the year 2024-25.
“Now imagine Rs17,000 being stolen per person per month for 12,000 people. It comes to Rs2.4 billion per year. So, Rs2.4 billion is being distributed among the top guys as a bribe. Not as a bribe, as stealing, as wage theft.”
For his part, Tariq Ali Nizamani, the SSWMB’s managing director, told Dawn.com that the board is currently responsible for managing waste for 70pc of Karachi, for which they have approximately 10,000 people as part of the sanitation force, and another 5000 workers comprising their drivers, helpers, and on-ground management staff.
The SSWMB hires these workers through a third party. According to Nizamani, they direct the contractors to pay the minimum wage set by the government. He was positive that they pay this amount to the workers on the street, as they have methods to ensure that.
“We have an in-house committee; our officers and the assistant director work in the zone. The deputy director is working in the district. Plus, we have not received any such complaint that they are getting less salary.”
But the ground realities narrate a different story.
Hussain Amir*, a resident of Lyari, works as a rickshaw driver for a company contracted by the SSWMB. Before he was fired for complaining, he earned Rs32,000 while driving a garbage truck. As a result of that complaint a few months ago, he was dismissed. After much pleading, he has managed to return to the same company—this time as a rickshaw driver—on a reduced salary, and now earns a mere Rs25,000.
Das, the sweeper, could only partially speak Urdu, but one thing he made sure to communicate clearly was that he did not want his name or picture included in the story — as there had been cases of workers being fired for complaining.
“They do not issue any contractual letters to workers to prevent them from unionising — because if they do, we will help them file complaints and ensure their contractors abide by the law,” Zulfiqar Shah, Chairman of the All Pakistan Local Government Workers Federation, told Dawn.com.
Karachi South is under contract with a Turkish company, Aysis, Shah added — a detail that was also confirmed by Nizamani.
 
 

According to Shah, sweepers and drivers like Das and Abid have been hired through fourth- and fifth-party contractors.
“The companies have resorted to petty contracting — asking their people to recruit groups of workers to make up the required labour force.”
Das’s fellow sweeper, Karim Akash*, comes from a village in Hyderabad. Like Das, he finds any space he can at the Karachi Metropoltian Cooperation (KMC) workshop to sleep, and relies on Saylani Welfare Trust for food. He confirmed that there is no written agreement with the person who hired them.
“I was told about this job by a contractor in my village, who then connected me with a contractor here.”
“Every morning, he [the contractor] takes our picture to mark attendance. A supervisor comes to count the number of workers. He [the supervisor] gives the money to the contractor, and we are paid in cash every week,” Akash added.

When Dawn.com reached out to Nizamani again after receiving this information, he again mentioned that there have been no direct complaints, however, they have received some indirect complaints due to which they are already talking to contractors about putting the sanitation workers on a payroll.
He also requested Dawn.com to speak to him after reading a write-up by the board which said, “The SSWMB had made contracts for provision of sanitation services with the international companies registered in Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).”
“The said contracts are clear that the SSWMB will pay the companies for their verified provided services as per the contract and shall impose penalties for any highlighted negligence as prescribed in the contracts.”
The write-up elaborated that the, “SSWMB has neither hired directly or indirectly any sanitation worker nor paid any wages to any sanitation worker. The companies being in service contract with SSWMB are being paid for the services which they provide under the Service Contract Agreements, and companies are bound to abide all prevailing laws of the Government.”
“Such allegation over SSWMB regarding payment of mere pittance to sanitation workers of Karachi and Hyderabad who work as third party daily wagers is denied,” it stated.
Is minimum wage enough?
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), a monthly income of over Rs75,000 is required to support a family of six with basic necessities such as food, housing, utilities, healthcare and education.
The HRCP has urged that wages must reflect the principle that “full-time workers should be able to live with security, health and hope,” as the government prepared to announce the federal budget of the upcoming fiscal year 2025-2026.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) also demanded a raise in minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs50,000 prior to the budget announcement.
Citing a World Bank report, PPP’s Labour Bureau Head Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed said that 44pc of the population is living below the poverty line and called for better health facilities for industrial workers and an increase in their death and marriage grants.
Hina Amin*, a machine operator at a denim manufacturing factory in Korangi’s industrial area, doesn’t even care for a raise. Before even waiting to hear the full question about her wage, she started expressing her frustration regarding the untimely payment of salary.
“Why do people work? You tell me. They work for a livelihood.” Amin exclaimed.
“Believe me, we have to fight and protest for our month’s salary. If we protest, we are thrown out,” she added.
Amin is salaried at the minimum wage of Rs37,000. She spends at least Rs60 daily travelling to and from work, in addition to her rent, bills, and grocery. Since the factory does not have a canteen, the workers have to manage their food as well. Sometimes, even when a worker scheduled for a 9am to 6pm shift arrives a few minutes before 9, they are still marked late — resulting in a further deduction from their salary.
When asked if she had tried to request a higher salary to make ends meet, she complained that the workers were already not receiving their salaries on time, which was her primary concern.
“First, they should at least give us our salaries on time so that we don’t have to take loans to pay our rents. Then comes the topic of salary increase,” she stated.
“If we say anything, they will kick us out […] we are helpless,” she added.
Sadiq echoed Amin’s thoughts on the matter. He said that in an ideal world, the minimum wage should be at least Rs60,000. “We should and we will certainly push for those wages.”
However, “this discussion should normally begin after workers are getting what is already the minimum wage,” he stressed.
“Sadly, right now, we are fighting for every morsel and every breath.”
‘There is no way to save them’
So who decides what the minimum wage should be? Who ensures it is abided by? And whom does one turn to when it’s not?
Labour law expert, Danish Nayyer, explained that following the 18th Amendment, labour laws were devolved to the provinces. Now, all provinces have their own laws and procedures for declaring and implementing minimum wages.
Nayyer told Dawn.com that in Sindh, the Sindh Minimum Wages Act, 2015 governed the area. In pursuance of the Act, the Labour and Human Resources Department of the provincial government declared the minimum wage. Currently, the minimum wage for unskilled workers is fixed at Rs37,000, similar to the federal level.
 

Organisational chart of the Sindh Labour Department.

Last year, following the announcement of the budget for 2024-2025, Public Accounts Committee Chairman Nisar Ahmed Khuhro admitted to the violation of labours laws and directed the Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (SESSI) and the labour department to strictly implement the policy of providing the minimum monthly wage to all workers across the province after reviewing the audit reports of SESSI for the years 2018 and 2019.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SESSI commissioner, Miandad Rahoojo, explained that the institution has around 780,000 registered workers, all of whom are receiving at least the minimum wage. The commissioner admitted, however, to a mass violation of minimum wage laws across Sindh, including some “serious” cases of violations, especially at brick kilns where the lives of workers resemble “the worst form of slavery”.
“Even pre-Islamic times were not as bad as this,” he lamented.
Rahoojo said, however, that the responsibility of ensuring the implementation of wage laws and of maintaining a complete digital base for it is on the Labour Department, clarifying that SESSI does not cater to any complaints regarding the violation of the law either.
“SESSI doesn’t cater to these complaints. There is a minimum wage board, which announces [the wage] and the labour department ensures its implementation. SESSI only registers the workers who get the minimum wage. In a way, SESSI has a role in the reactive way.”
The secretary of the Minimum Wage Board, Naeem Mangi, had a similar response.
“When it comes to the question of implementation, it is the responsibility of the labour department; we only fix the minimum wages,” he concurred.
He said their board often received complaints through the PM’s Portal regarding violation of the minimum wage law; however, if the investigation starts, the company would usually fire that employee.
“There is no way to save them.”
Where to file a complaint?
NTUF General Secretary Mansoor told Dawn.com that one can complain against the employer to the joint director of the labour department. “There is no cost of complaint.”
However, there is no helpline for complaints or any awareness campaigns for employees like Asadullah and Haq to educate them on their rights and processes to raise their voice in the case of violation of their rights.
The lawyer, Nayyer, explained that under the Sindh Payment of Minimum Wage Act, if an employee wants to report a case of underpayment, they must file a complaint to the Payment of Wages Authority.
“There is no helpline with respect to filing any complaint; the complaint has to be made in writing and filed before the authority,” Nayyer stated.
“The employee can either file the complaint directly in their personal capacity, for which there are no costs, or they can choose to file the complaint through a lawyer; the legal fee varies from lawyer to lawyer.”
Nayyer added that the authority writes to the employer once they have received a complaint.
As to who would act as the final arbiter in this scenario, the the Sindh Minimum Wage Act 2015 states: “Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, appoint any person to be authority for any area, specified in the notification, to hear and decide all claims arising out of non- payment, or delay in the payment of wages to workers in that area whose minimum rates of wages have been declared under the provisions of this Act.”
“Both parties then get the right to a hearing, they can make the employer pay you a minimum wage and can pass an order,” Nayyer elaborated.
“Under the Sindh Minimum Wages Act 2015 and its rules, the Sindh Minimum Wages Rules, 2021, the Authority has the powers under the Sindh Land Revenue Act, 1976 to seize or attach bank accounts of employers in case they do not comply with the payment of minimum wages,” Nayyer elaborated.
As per the Sindh Minimum Wage Act 2015, Section 9(3):
“Any employer who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees but not less than twenty thousand rupees or with both, in addition to payment of sum not less than the difference in wages actually paid to the worker and the amount which would have been paid to him had there been no such contravention.”
Inspecting violation
Awais Ali Chandio, a machine operator at a denim manufacturing factory in Karachi’s Korangi, is salaried at Rs37,000 but must put in at least 50 hours overtime per month to meet his family’s needs. Luckily, since he is a company employee, he gets double his hourly rate — Rs300 per hour — until he works 50 hours as overtime per month. Beyond that, he receives the usual Rs150 for each hour of overtime work.
Unfortunately, though, the contractual employees at his company do not share the same perks despite fulfilling the same duties as Chandio’s.
“They get paid somewhere between Rs28,000 to Rs32,000; their overtime rate is also just Rs100 per hour,” said Chandio.
Although it is not company policy, employees at Chandio’s workplace are still hired on a contractual basis.
“The management pulls this off to fill their stomachs. This way, they are able to make at least Rs20,000 per employee,” he said, while criticising the managers, adding that the company had around 200 to 250 contractual employees hidden among a few thousand company employees.
The question is, who is in charge of pointing out such practices and putting an end to them?
As per the 2019 SHC report, in order to monitor “whether application of minimum wage has been observed as set down by the Government of Sindh, the inspectors had been appointed under section 14 of the Act 2015.”
It elaborated on the inspection system.
“The purpose of appointing inspectors is to carry out inspections under Rule 22 of the West Pakistan Minimum Wages Rules 1962 which states, that if any inspector during the inspection detects any irregularity on the part of employer, they should advise management of the establishment to rectify the same and in case of further violation of minimum wage laws, such establishments should be prosecuted in the Court of Law.
“During the visits of [the] Commission across Sindh, it was observed that several posts of inspectors within the meaning of Section 14 of the Act 2015, were lying vacant,” the report said.
It added that, “When it was asked of the Secretary Labour Department and the Chairman Minimum Board as to whether any violation of minimum wages had been detected, they denied the fact regarding the violation of Sindh Minimum Wages Act.”
“In case of any violation of Minimum Wages, such establishments are prosecuted in the court of law,” the report cited Saeed Saleh Jumani, Incharge Chairman Minimum Wage Board.
“Labour inspector, labour officer, assistant director, director, deputy director and joint director go to factories and organisations to implement wage laws […] only they know what happens then,” Mangi commented.
Why the ‘poor implementation’?
For civil rights activist and lawyer, Jibran Nasir, workers’ rights remain poorly protected in Sindh due to systemic failures of both the Labour Department and SESSI.
He highlighted SESSI’s failure in recovering over Rs500 million in outstanding dues from employers and “eroding employees’ trust” by ignoring reimbursement claims of medical expenses by employees for three years.
Jibran also criticised the Labour Department for not producing records of any formal complaints regarding non-payment of minimum wage, despite widespread evidence of violations. “It also failed to present even a record of complaints received, reflecting weak enforcement and worker fear. There is no updated or integrated database of workers or businesses, severely limiting oversight,” he said.
Each year, the federal government releases a notification updating the minimum wage after the budget release, often only after much pressure from trade unions and activists, said Sadiq. This alone speaks volumes of the authorities’ priorities when it comes to those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.
“People like me often push for the notification after the budget is released, as the minimum wage notification is often missing,” said Sadiq. “Ultimately, the minimum wage notification is issued somewhere in September.”
Sporadically, the government runs campaigns to implement minimum wage laws and spread awareness. According to SESSI’s Rahoojo, his department has run several awareness campaigns over the years. “We have launched a campaign for awareness. We are meeting every trade association to ask them to register employees,” he said. The employers, however, usually resist registering the workers and paying them minimum wage, he added.
“If the employer has 1,000 workers, he would register 50 of them. This is discrimination,” he lamented.
 
 

For Jibran Nasir though, this is all a hogwash. “Annual increases in minimum wage appear more performative than impactful, as poor implementation, official apathy, and corruption prevent these measures from translating into real benefits,” he said, marking it as the main reason workers remain largely unprotected and excluded from basic legal entitlements.
Challenges faced by the industry
At a post-budget press conference last month, Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, when questioned on giving a 10pc raise to civil servants while maintaining status quo on the minimum wage in the current fiscal year, requested to raise this question with industrial associations and “get their feedback on it.”
He mentioned the industry’s “big question on formal versus informal sector” and linked the question of minimum wage with industry competitiveness.
“I think at this point, we are at a good place with minimum wage,” he added.
The industry, it appears, seems to agree with him. According to federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s Marketing Director Faizul Haq, it is important to apply these laws in a gradual, phased and “realistic fashion” by keeping account of the ground realities and the capacity of businesses, “specifically small, medium enterprises to pay their labour.”
“The main point here primarily concerns the cost of doing business, and wages are an important and significant component of the same.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the Chief Financial Officer of a major export company told Dawn.com that while the objective behind minimum wage laws is good, which is to improve the lives of the workers, lawmakers need to think about demand in the economic engine in the “real sense”.
“Businesses, especially the labour-intensive ones, are facing challenges due to a slowdown in demand. So, policy makers also need to think about creating an enabling environment.”
Faizul, on the other hand, while explaining the cyclical nature of business, highlighted the drawbacks of not factoring in economic compulsions while fixing minimum wages.
“If you burden the businesses, the ultimate cost would be paid by the consumers, and it would result in inflation because if the products or services are costlier, the cost would ultimately be transferred to the end consumers.”
“The whole cycle needs to be understood, and it has to be done in consultation with the business community.” He emphasised the importance of dealing with this issue, keeping in mind the economic outcomes instead of the political ones.
“We have to understand that this is an economic question rather than a political question […] this is a cycle and this cycle needs to be understood in a phased and logical manner.”
For the security guard Asadullah and millions like him, the wrangling between the industrialists and the government holds little meaning. He will likely continue to work for a pittance, as authorities and business owners continue to point fingers, with little thought or concern for the plight of workers who find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet even if they are lucky to get minimum wage.

Pelicot, 72, and Williams were both named knights of the Legion of Honour on a list announced ahead of France’s July 14 national day.
Pelicot earned international tributes for her courage in testifying at a trial in 2024 against her former husband, who drugged her and arranged for her to be raped by dozens of men over a decade.
She has since been named on lists of the world’s most influential people by international media and the case helped force a change in France’s rape law.
But Pelicot has remained silent since the trial. Her lawyer says she is concentrating on writing a book giving her side of the mass rape story which is to be released in 2026.
 






Williams, 52, made his name as a rapper and singer but earned a second fortune as a music producer and after designing clothes and accessories for several brands. He has been Louis Vuitton’s men’s creative director since 2023.
His recent Paris show attracted a host of international celebrities, including Jay Z and Beyonce, film directors Steve McQueen and Spike Lee and football and basketball stars.

Eyewitnesses informed police that the woman, along with her minor sons, aged one and three years, was walking along the Lahore-Karachi railway track.
They said that despite being warned of the approaching goods train by a passerby, the woman wrapped her arms around the children and jumped onto the track. All of them were run over by the train and died instantly.
Teams of Railway police, Ghala Mandi police and Rescue 1122 reached the spot and collected evidence and recorded witnesses’ statements, while Rescue 1122 staff shifted the bodies to the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.
Police are trying to ascertain the identity of the deceased woman.
Ghala Mandi police Sub Inspector Imtiaz says that woman’s fingerprints have been sent to Nadra Lahore office for identification. SHO Mr Amjad said that announcements were made in nearby localities through mosques, besides issuance of handouts to local social media platforms, asking the public to share information, if any, about the deceased woman.
POISONED: A commission agent was allegedly poisoned to death by his friend for demanding back Rs1.2m he had lent to the suspect at 69/12-L village of Chichawatni.
As per police, Bashir Ahmed had lent Rs1.2m to his friend Ranjha last year.
When Bashir demanded his money back, Ranjha appeared reluctant. However, on being pushed by Bashir, Ranjha invited him to his house to return the amount.
When Bashir arrived at his house, with his maternal uncle Qadir Bakish, Ranjha was present there along with Mukhtar and an unknown man.
During the meeting, tea was served. Before taking tea, Qadir went out to buy cigarettes. When he was returning, he saw Ranjha, Mukhtar and their friend fleeing the house, where he found Bashir vomiting blood. He died instantly. The police say that initial investigations show that he was poisoned. An FIR has been registered, but no arrest has been made so far.

Special Court (CNS) Judge Rajesh Chander Rajput convicted accused Nakawa Edihi of the offence punishable under Section 9 (1) 7 (b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).
According to state prosecutor Abdul Hannan, the accused arrived in Pakistan in January after allegedly concealing 11 capsules containing 144 gram of cocaine in her stomach. She was apprehended by an Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) team at the Jinnah International Airport.
However, when she appeared before the court for framing of formal charges, she voluntarily pleaded guilty and prayed for mercy. On her admission, the court recorded her statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), in which she confessed to the offence.

Court takes a lenient view in handing down jail term after accused pleads guilty

“I have heard the accused have thoroughly gone through the record of the case. During framing of formal charge, accused has admitted her guilt of attempt to import 11 capsules having 144 gram of ‘cocaine’ concealed in her body cavity to Pakistan,” the judge noted.
Reasoning for lesser punishment, the court observed that the accused has repeatedly pleaded guilty by “detailing her poor financial circumstances and from her demeanor”.
“This court has concluded that her admission of guilt was voluntarily and free from any coercion whatsoever from any corner,” it added.
In her statement before the court, the accused deposed that she was a single mother of two minor children and was facing financial constraints to meet her daily expenses as she was also a diabetic patient hence, she committed this crime.
She further claimed to be the first offender and nothing was available in the investigation papers to suggest that she was a previous convict.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs50,000, on default she would have to serve additional imprisonment for five days.
According to prosecutor Hannan, a Nigerian national, Stephen Chubuike, was in contact with the prime accused. Later, he was apprehended and bail was granted to him as nothing was recovered from his possession.
However, at the hearing, he failed to appear before the court as a result the court cancelled his surety bond and issued non-bailable warrant for his arrest.
A case was registered at the ANF Clifton station under Section 9(1) 7(b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).

• Traffic police using new number plates campaign as a ‘trap for bribery’, alleges Monem Zafar
• Muttahida urges review of fees, seeks mobile camps to ease process
KARACHI: The criticism by the opposition parties against a government move to replace vehicle number plates with new Ajrak-themed designs and allow traffic police to issue hefty fines against ordinary people gained momentum as they demanded that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stop law enforcers from taking extreme action and waive the fees for the new number plates.
On Sunday, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) organised a “bike rally” and hundreds of motorcyclists took to the streets, protesting against the PPP government and accusing it of “enabling corruption and creating new opportunities for law enforcement officials to demand bribes”.
The protesters also questioned the priorities and policies of the provincial government, accusing it of “failing” to provide basic necessities and essential public services while focusing instead on vehicle registration plates.
The bike rally kicked off from Five Star Chowrangi in North Nazimabad and concluded near Fresco Chowk, off Burns Road, drawing a large crowd, with the majority of participants being young riders.
Addressing the participants, the JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar strongly lambasted the PPP government over its “wrongful” approach and priorities aimed at “minting money”, instead of bringing some ease to Karachiites.
“The Karachiites are facing multiple daily life crises. They are facing acute water shortage, the roads in the city are broken, garbage has become a big issue and health risk in a large number of areas. There are only 400 buses for 35 million people, infrastructure has gone, load-shedding is still a problem in several towns, but the PPP government has chosen number plates to keep its focus on,” he added.
In this backdrop, he said, bikers were halted at every nook and corner of the city, and the number plates campaign was being used as a “trap for bribery” by the “corrupt” elements in the traffic police.
He urged the government to reconsider its decision and immediately halt the campaign, warning that failure to do so would provoke a strong public protest from the people of Karachi.
The growing controversy over the fresh campaign of the government and the imposition of a new fee for culturally-themed plates has started attracting criticism from almost all political parties in Karachi.
Muttahida demands review of fee
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has directed its Sindh Assembly members to urgently meet with the provincial Excise Minister to address the public’s concerns.
In a statement, the MQM-P central committee highlighted that over 3.3 million motorcycles and 2.3 million vehicles are registered in Karachi, yet their owners — despite applying and paying online — are not receiving number plates on time.
“Complaints remain unresolved, and citizens face harassment from traffic police for not displaying plates, even though they have already paid the required fee during registration,” it said.
The party demanded that mobile camps be set up on main roads for plate distribution and that plates be couriered directly to applicants, to eliminate long queues and exploitation by agents.
It has also called for a review of the plate fees and rebates for those who have already paid under the old system.
Afaq calls it ‘Ajrak tax’
Separately, Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM-Haqiqi) chairman Afaq Ahmed strongly condemned the Sindh government’s decision to issue new Ajrak-themed number plates for motorcycles, charging Rs1,850 per vehicle.
Calling it a discriminatory “Ajrak tax,” he warned that such policies could lead to dangerous ethnic divisions within the province.
“We do not want Sindh’s division, but if this injustice continues, a strong public reaction is inevitable,” he said.
He also accused the Sindh government of treating Karachi like a “colony”, “exploiting” its resources while “denying” residents basic infrastructure, transport, education and law enforcement.
He demanded equal compensation for victims of traffic accidents in Karachi, similar to that provided in interior Sindh.

• Legislation says shift necessitated by ‘changing dynamics of national security’; allows for countrywide deployment of Federal Constabulary
• Force to have dedicated division for special protection and riot control
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC), a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance, the Law and Justice Division issued an official notification to this effect. According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories.
However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.
“As the Senate and the National Assembly are not in session and the President of the Islamic Repu­blic of Pakistan is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate act­ion,” the ordinance said. The ordi­nance called the Frontier Cons­tabulary (Re-organization) Ordi­nance, 2025, came into force at once.
A former interior secretary told Dawn that the ordinance gave complete and legitimate authority to the federal government to use FC across the country and for any purpose, in the name of security.
He said the Frontier Consta­bulary was first deployed in Kara­chi about 25 years ago and then it was used in the federal capital. Later, it was deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan for the protection of the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and major dam projects.
Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.
The ordinance said that the force would be headed by an inspector general to be appointed by the federal government. The FC, it said, be used as a reserve force, to perform specialised duties in aid of the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, provincial police forces, and other security and law enforcement forces and agencies.
The Federal Constabulary shall be under the overall command of the inspector general, who shall be assisted by additional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and assistant inspectors general and such other officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), as may be appointed in the prescribed manner. It shall comprise two divisions, namely the Security Division and the Federal Reserve Division.
The structure of the Federal Constabulary shall comprise wings, companies and platoons, commanded by officers of the rank of superintendent of police, assistant superintendent of police, or deputy superintendent of police, inspector, sub-inspector, and assistant sub-inspector, respectively.
 
 

The FC’s Security Division shall comprise the existing strength of the Frontier Constabulary and shall consist exclusively of the personnel appointed through the traditional system as prescribed by regulations.
There shall be a dedicated division for anti-riot and special protection in the Federal Constabulary called the Federal Reserve Division. The Federal Constabulary shall have the powers as enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the Police Order, 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order No. 22 of 2002) and any other law for the time being in force.
Shifting all powers
In addition to such powers, the federal government may, by general or special order, confer or impose upon any member of the Federal Constabulary any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed on a police officer of any class or grade by any enactment for the time being in force.
The ordinance also shifts all powers and assets of the Frontier Constabulary to the Federal Constabulary, as it said: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force all members and employees of the Frontier Constabulary serving in the defunct Frontier Constabulary immediately before the commencement of this ordinance, immediately after the commencement of this ordinance shall stands transferred to the Federal Constabulary reconstituted under this ordinance on same terms and conditions as applicable to them before commencement of this ordinance.”
“All assets and liabilities of the Frontier Constabulary, of whatever nature and wherever situated, shall, upon commencement of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance stand transferred to and vest in the Federal Constabulary,” it added.
“All rules, regulations, notifications, and orders made or issued under the Frontier Constabulary Act, 1915, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of the Federal Constabulary,” the ordinance said.

Bitcoin scaled a record high of $121,207.55 in the Asian session on Monday, before pulling back slightly to last trade 1.6 per cent higher at $121,015.42.
Starting today, the US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide the digital asset industry with the nation’s regulatory framework it has long demanded.
Those demands have resonated with US President Donald Trump, who has called himself the “crypto president” and urged policymakers to revamp rules in favour of the industry.
“It’s riding a number of tailwinds at the moment,” said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, citing strong institutional demand, expectations of further gains and support from Trump as reasons for the bullishness.
“It’s been a very, very, strong move over the past six or seven days, and it’s hard to see where it stops now; it looks like it can easily have a look at the $125,000 level,” he said.
The surge in bitcoin, which is up 29pc for the year so far, has sparked a broader rally across other cryptocurrencies over the past few sessions, even in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs.
Ether, the second-largest token, scaled a more than five-month top of $3,050.90, while XRP and Solana gained about 3pc each.
The sector’s total market value has swelled to about $3.78 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Earlier this month, Washington declared the week of July 14 as “crypto week”, where members of Congress are set to vote on the Genius Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.
The most significant bill is the Genius Act, which would create federal rules for stablecoins.
Elsewhere, prices of crypto-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong similarly surged.
Spot bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera all scaled record highs, while the three ether ETFs managed by the asset managers were up roughly 2pc each.</p><small>2025-07-14 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141059065b833b7.jpg?r=105913' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924084/six-dead-27-injured-as-multan-bound-bus-crashes-on-motorway-near-chakri' target='_blank'><strong>Six dead, 27 injured as Multan-bound bus crashes on motorway near Chakri</strong></a><br><p>CHAKWAL: Six people, including four women, lost their lives while 27 others sustained injuries as a bus carrying them crashed on Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2) near Chakri Interchange on Sunday noon.

The case was registered on complaint of Motra Police Station SHO Mobin Ahmed Cheema who said that the police were performing routine duty when they reached village Ralioke at 2pm and found a mob carrying hammers, sticks and iron rods.
The mob wanted to demolish the Jamaat-e-Ahmadiyya’s Baitul Zikr. He said that the angry protesters were told several times not to take the law into their hands but in vain. Instead, they attacked the policemen.
The officer said that a heavy contingent reached the spot on receiving information about the attack on the police.
When the SP investigation Sialkot reached the spot, the angry protesters attacked the police once again, pelted them with stones and opened fire, damaging the van of the SP and the prisoners.

Alcaraz’s bid for a third straight title at the All England Club ended with a 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4 loss on Centre Court, leaving him to digest his first Grand Slam final defeat.
“It’s always a bad feeling losing matches. It’s a little bit worse when you lose in a final,” said Alcaraz, who narrowly beat Sinner in a five-set humdinger at the French Open last month.
“I’m just proud about everything I’ve done in the last four weeks on grass at London. I leave Wimbledon, the court, with my head held really high because I did everything that I could.
“I played against someone who played an unbelievable game. So I’m just a little bit sad about losing, but with my head held really high.”
Alcaraz said his rivalry with Sinner was great for the pair and also for tennis, which has had to endure the retirements of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray in recent years with fellow great Novak Djokovic in the twilight of a glorious career.
The young duo have now shared eight of the last nine Grand Slam titles, with each winning four.
“Every time we play each other, I think our level is really high. We don’t see a level like this. I don’t see any player playing against each other, having the level that we’re playing when we face each other,” Alcaraz added.
Extra Attention
“This rivalry, it’s becoming better and better. We’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, finals of Masters and the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better.
“I’m just really grateful for that because it gives me the opportunity to just give my 100 per cent every practice, every day, just to be better. The level that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Jannik is really high.”
Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill admitted that while the Italian did not take any of his rivals for granted, he does pay extra attention to Alcaraz.
“Jannik watches more Carlos matches than he does anybody else because he’s fascinated with the improvements that are coming in his game, and he’s pushing us as coaches to make sure that he’s improving as a tennis player,” Cahill said.
Sinner, who ended Alcaraz’s 24-match winning run across all events and 20-match streak at Wimbledon, was most pleased with ending his own run of five successive defeats against the Spaniard.
“When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy,” said Sinner, who narrowed his win-loss record against Alcaraz to 5-8.
“At the same time in the past, I felt I was close. I never pushed myself down. I keep looking up to Carlos because even today I felt like he was doing a couple of things better than I did. So that’s something we’ll work on and prepare ourselves because he’s going to come for us again.
“There’s not only Carlos, but everyone. We have a big target on us so we have to be prepared. Then we’ll see what’s happening in the future.”
Alcaraz said he had no doubt that Sinner would learn from his near 5-1/2-hour loss at Roland Garros, where the Italian squandered three championship points, and hit back.
“I know he’s a really nice player and a huge champion. Champions learn from their losses,” Alcaraz said.
“I knew from the beginning he was going to learn from that final and not make the same mistakes. The way he played today, it was really high.
“I wasn’t surprised at all.”</p><small>2025-07-14 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14083021c4241e6.jpg?r=083025' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924023/red-tape-abounds-as-officials-with-look-after-charge-at-wapda-helm' target='_blank'><strong>Red tape abounds as officials with ‘look after’ charge at Wapda helm</strong></a><br><p>• With the sole permanent member (finance) also doubling as the authority’s chairman, two key positions have been filled by officers on ‘look after’ basis
• Absence of quorum potentially leaves water body’s decisions open to audit objections, legal challenges
LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), one of the country’s largest state-owned entities with a portfolio of almost $70 billion, has found itself mired in red tape in the absence of key decision-making officials.
The failure to fill two vacant slots on its governing body despite the passage of nine months, has hampered its operations.
This bureaucratic paralysis is particularly worrisome, given that Wapda is currently tasked with executing three of the biggest hydroelectric projects in the country’s history — the dams at Diamer-Bhasha, Dasu and Mohmand.
In addition, the authority effectively serves as the operative wing of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), which distributes water among federating units and ensure national irrigation supplies.
Ironically, Irsa too is embroiled in litigation over the composition of its board, with the appointment of a permanent member from Sindh being the focus of the dispute.
The Wapda Act envisions a governing body, comprising three permanent members — for water, power and finance — and a regular chairman heading the authority, which looks after hundreds of billions of rupees allocations every year.
Currently, the body is without permanent members for water and power, and their functions are being “looked after” by two senior officials — Syed Ali Akhtar Shah and Muhammad Arfan, respectively.
The former previously served as General Manager Water (South), while the latter is also the CEO of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Company.
‘Look after’ charge
By its very definition, ‘look after’ charge implies that the current holder of the post cannot take “financial and administrative decisions” of any consequence — much like a caretaker government.
In June, when former chairman retired Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani stepped down, the sole permanent member, Naveed Asghar Chaudhry, was given additional charge of that role too. Mr Chaudhry’s original designation is member for finance, and he is a permanent appointee on that post.
This means that, effectively, the four-member board is currently operating with one permanent officer and two who have been given ‘additional charge’.
Mr Chaudhry also served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022, after retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to Lt-Gen Ghani three months later.
According to a former director general of human resources at Wapda, “This is administrative chaos with a huge national cost”. For instance, the authority at present cannot meet even its quorum requirements – a legal necessity for taking any decision.
For quorum to be complete, the chairman and at least one regular member are required to be present, but these posts are currently held by the same person.
In such a situation, any decision taken by the board can potentially attract audit objections or legal challenges.
Blame game
Dawn made several attempts to contact Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, the incumbent federal minister for water resources, over the course of two weeks.
However, both the minister and his spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the composition of Wapda’s governing body.
But insiders told Dawn that the tenure of the two members for water and power expired in November last year.
Sources claimed the ministry was also informed of this in advance, and an advertisement to fill both posts was sent to the ministry for approval in October 2024. However, the ministry has not advertised the posts, nor allowed Wapda to do so, they said.
The outgoing members, meanwhile, were reportedly instructed to remain in their posts. This arrangement continued till March 13, 2025, when they eventually relinquished their posts on verbal instructions from on-high, after the ministry inquired about the expiry of their tenures. After that, the authority gave ‘look after’ charge of the two vacant posts to two senior officers.
Wapda sources claimed they kept pressing the ministry for the appointments, but to no avail. It was in the midst of this confusion that the previous chairman abruptly quit on June 20.
Following his exit, the ministry handed his responsibilities to the only surviving permanent member (finance) of the authority.
The ministry, however, shifted the blame for blocked appointments onto the PM’s Office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the water resources ministry told Dawn that selection boards were named to hire these officers and sent the PMO, but there had been no response.
The ministry was subsequently told that the names of the selection board members had been sent for “vetting” and the process is still ongoing.
