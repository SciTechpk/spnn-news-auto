“It’s a double-edged sword,” said Sibylle Treiblmaier, outside the house in the town of Braunau am Inn on the border with Germany.
While it might discourage far-right extremists from gathering at the site, it could have “been used better or differently”, the 53-year-old office assistant told AFP.
The government wants to “neutralise” the site and passed a law in 2016 to take control of the dilapidated building from its private owner.

Austria — which was annexed by Hitler’s Germany in 1938 — has repeatedly been criticised in the past for not fully acknowledging its responsibility in the Holocaust.
The far-right Freedom Party, founded by former Nazis, is ahead in the polls after getting the most votes in a national election for the first time in 2024, though it failed to form a government.
Last year, two streets in Braunau am Inn commemorating Nazis were renamed after years of complaints by activists.
‘Problematic’
The house where Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, and lived for a short period of his early life, is right in the centre of town on a narrow shop-lined street.
A memorial stone in front reads: “For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Warn.”

When AFP visited this week, workers were putting the finishing touches to the renovated facade.
Officers are scheduled to move in during “the second quarter of 2026”, the interior ministry said.
But for author Ludwig Laher, a member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria that represents Holocaust victims, “a police station is problematic, as the police… are obliged, in every political system, to protect what the state wants”.
An earlier idea to turn the house into a place where people would come together to discuss peace-building had “received a lot of support”, he told AFP.

Jasmin Stadler, a 34-year-old shop owner and Braunau native, said it would have been interesting to put Hitler’s birth in the house in a “historic context”, explaining more about the house.
She also slammed the 20-million-euro ($24-million) cost of the rebuild.
‘Bit of calm’
But others are in favour of the redesign of the house, which many years ago was rented by the interior ministry and housed a centre for people with disabilities before it fell into disrepair.
Wolfgang Leithner, a 57-year-old electrical engineer, said turning it into a police station would “hopefully bring a bit of calm”, avoiding it becoming a shrine for far-right extremists.
“It makes sense to use the building and give it to the police, to the public authorities,” he said.
The office of Braunau’s conservative mayor declined an AFP request for comment.
Throughout Austria, debate on how to address the country’s Holocaust history has repeatedly flared.

According to a notification issued by the provincial government on Friday, Shah’s posting relieves Sindh’s Central Police Office Headquarters DIG Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh of his additional charge “with immediate effect”.
“Syed Pir Muhammad Shah … is posted as Deputy Inspector General of Police, Traffic, Karachi, relieving Mr. Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh, an officer of PSP (BS-20) Deputy Inspector General of Police, Headquarters, Central Police Office, Sindh from the additional charge of the post,” the notification stated.
A copy of the notification is available with Dawn.

Shaikh was transferred and posted as the new traffic police chief after the government removed Shah as the chief of Karachi traffic police at the end of January.
While last month’s notification was silent about the reasons behind DIG Shah’s removal, informed sources told Dawn that Inspector General of Police (IGP) Javed Alam Odho had sought an explanation from him regarding allegations of “misuse of authority” in registration of a case in Hyderabad last year, allegedly on his instructions.</p><small>2026-02-21 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2111362379ff111.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974778/youth-abducted-released-after-filming-viral-cricket-video-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Youth abducted, released after filming viral cricket video in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A youth from North Waziristan who was reportedly abducted by unidentified individuals for sharing a viral video showing a young girl playing cricket in the region was released, it emerged on Saturday.
A viral video showing young cricketer Aina Wazir bowling in North Waziristan drew widespread attention on mainstream and social media. However, the abduction of the young man who filmed and shared the clip on social media triggered concern across the region.
According to local police, the man, Zafran Wazir, was allegedly abducted by unidentified individuals from the Shewa subdivision of the district.
During his captivity, a video circulated on social media in which he termed sharing the cricket clip his “mistake” and stated that he was in the custody of unknown persons.
In the same video, the abductors claimed that recording and circulating footage of a minor girl playing cricket was “against Islam and Pashtun traditions”.
Following efforts by local tribal elders through a jirga, Wazir was safely recovered and returned home. Residents welcomed him warmly, placing garlands around his neck, with videos of the reception also circulating online.
District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Hussain confirmed that the youth had safely reunited with his family and said investigations into the incident were underway.
Eight-year-old Aina Wazir’s passion for cricket had already been a subject of discussion in the region. Her viral video caught the attention of the owner of the Pakistan Super League franchise Peshawar Zalmi, Javed Afridi, who said that “talent like this deserves the right platform”.
In a post on X, Afridi said that she would be part of the upcoming Zalmi Women League — a platform for girls to “play, inspire, and express their talents”.
“We will ensure she is provided with all necessary cricket equipment and proper facilities so she gets the opportunity she truly deserves to grow and shine and become the next Saira Jabeen,” he said.







The video had also captured the attention of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who said on X, “It is truly heartening to witness such extraordinary raw talent emerging from our soil, a powerful reminder of the immense potential within our youth.”
He said he hoped to see Aina receive the encouragement, training, and institutional support she deserved so her talent “can be fully refined”.







Aina, in response, pledged to work hard to play for the women’s cricket team and expressed special gratitude to Afridi for including her in the Zalmi Women League, calling it the “biggest moment” of her life.</p><small>2026-02-21 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21113700253b1e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974776/45-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-twin-cities-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>4.5-magnitude earthquake shakes twin cities, surrounding areas</strong></a><br><p>A 4.5-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of northern Pakistan on Saturday, alarming residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with tremors also felt in nearby areas, including Swabi, Haripur and Khanpur.
According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre located north of Mardan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Residents reported that homes and office buildings swayed during the quake, prompting many people to step outside as a precaution.
Seismologists said moderate earthquakes are common in northern Pakistan due to tectonic activity in the Himalayan region and advised residents to stay calm and follow safety precautions.
Earlier on Friday, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck parts of KP, with its epicentre located in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, according to the PMD.
In Shangla, tremors were felt at the time of Iftar, prompting people to rush out of their homes. No casualties or damages were reported from the district.
Earlier this week, a 5.6-magnitude earthquake was recorded 86km northeast of Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
Last month, an earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of KP.
The same month, another 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.</p><small>2026-02-21 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/210215550d95889.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974696/whats-behind-gandapurs-return-to-form' target='_blank'><strong>What’s behind Gandapur’s ‘return to form’?</strong></a><br><p>Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s recent shenanigans have brought back memories of what it was like when the mercurial man from Dera was the focus of PTI’s politics in the province.
His sudden departure from the party’s tumultuous politics in October of last year, had turned the political dynamics of the province on its head.
In a way, his fate was not too different from that of other PTI-nominated chief ministers who came before him – Mahmood Khan and Parvez Khattak. They too faded into the political wilderness once removed from power.
With the PTI currently in the throes of another leadership crisis, the Sardar from Kulachi returned with a bang. For almost five months, Gandapur shied away from the media limelight that he so loved while in office. But in recent media appearances, he is clearly back to his boisterous self.
While the party’s energies were fully devoted towards highlighting Imran Khan’s health issues and pushing the narrative that he has been denied timely treatment, the jilted former CM’s resurfacing was being viewed with a mixture of trepidation and chagrin.
‘Comeback tour’
Earlier this week, he showed up at a PTI protest in Islamabad, breaking his silence by giving back-to-back interviews to TV channels and podcasts, where he trashed his party and its leadership without restraint.
He even praised Mohsin Naqvi – at a time when the party regards him as one of those responsible for the current plight of their leader – claiming that the federal interior minister had made “more serious and sustained efforts than anyone else to secure Imran’s release from jail.”
This even prompted KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi to remark that Gandapur was Naqvi’s “good boy”.
“Naqvi had adopted him, and I do not think the interior minister has made any attempt to release Imran,” the governor said in a TV appearance following the former CM’s re-emergence.
In his recent comments, the man from Dera also targeted Aleema Khan. This seemed to be a continuation of his gripe with Imran’s sister, whose influence he had previously blamed for his ouster from office last year.
The subjects Gandapur broached upon raised many eyebrows, both among the leadership and commentators, and his behaviour left political pundits guessing: what motivated this sudden outburst, and what is his endgame?
Over the course of the past week, Dawn reached out to PTI central spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and provincial government spokesperson Shafi Jan for comment.
While the former two did not respond to requests for comment, the latter simply refused to discuss the matter, saying it was “the party’s internal issue and he could not comment on it.”
A spokesperson for Gandapur initially agreed to respond to written queries, but did not respond to subsequent communications.
Then, on Friday night, a few days after opening Pandora’s Box, Gandapur seemed to have a change of heart, issuing a two-minute video, where he reluctantly apologised for his outburst.
“People are creating a controversy out of my angry remarks. If my remarks have hurt someone… I am sorry for the time being,” he said.
Gandapur justified his anger by saying that the party had been unable to secure their legitimate demand of ensuring proper treatment for the incarcerated Imran.
“If someone is not angered by this, than they lack humanity,’” he said.
Party insiders’ views
“The question is why the former chief minister, who remained sequestered from politics in his Dera lair for the past several months, suddenly made an appearance in Islamabad,” a PTI office bearer requesting anonymity, told Dawn.
He said the former chief minister’s staff had cited several court cases against him in the federal capital as the reason why he stayed in his native town. “Now all of a sudden his legal troubles are of no consequence, and he is on every talk show in town.”
However, a local journalist in Dera Ismail Khan contested this assertion, saying Gandapur was staying in Islamabad most of the time after his resignation and visited his native town occasionally. “He had become very active in district politics over the last month,” the journalist said.
In PTI circles, party leaders are especially puzzled by the timing of Gandapur’s statements.
The social media brigade, meanwhile, feels vindicated, having dubbed Gandapur a “sellout and an establishment tout” long ago.
“Gandapur is a good politician, but whenever he faces a camera, he loses control over his emotions,” said one PTI insider.
He said that the PTI honoured him and he should play his role when the party is under pressure, but “the time was not opportune for his utterances”.
“If what he did in Islamabad continues, then he could turn into another Sher Afzal Marwat,” he said.
MNA Marwat, an outspoken lawyer, had risen to prominence by leading demonstrations after the party and workers were at the receiving end of a crackdown in the aftermath of the May 9 violence. He was later expelled from the party’s ranks for similarly divisive statements, upon Imran’s orders.
Gandapur’s outburst, according to a senior party leader, carried even more sinister undertones.
“Ali Amin wanted to undermine his successor, KP Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi, and his efforts, which is why he has given these statements,” he said.
Describing the former chief minister as ‘a loose cannon’, the senior party leader said Gandapur may be eyeing an opportunity for himself in case of Afridi’s disqualification – the matter of code of conduct violations in the Haripur by-poll is pending against the incumbent before the Election Commission of Pakistan.
“The powers that be have hinted to Gandapur that he has another chance of becoming chief minister if Afridi is disqualified, and that is why he has been flexing [his muscles],” he said.
Gandapur, the senior party leader said, has little goodwill left in the party, and even if Afridi is disqualified, the party was unlikely to entrust him with the responsibility of leading KP again.Meanwhile, Aleema, who has been at the receiving end of several of Gandapur’s attacks, dismissed his outbursts as a case of “shooting the messenger”.
“Since they owe their seats to Imran, they cannot say anything against him, so they target the family instead,” she said, in a recent interview with Independent Urdu.
“And when they are saying anything against us, they are [actually] venting their anger against Imran,” she said.</p><small>2026-02-21 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21113438584e7c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974777/trump-to-travel-to-china-next-month-with-us-tariffs-in-focus' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to travel to China next month, with US tariffs in focus</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, a trip announced as the Supreme Court overturned Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods.
A White House official confirmed the trip on Friday, just before the highest US court dealt Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war, including some against rival China.
Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs.
Ruling raises questions for US-China relations
But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals.
Twenty percent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the court ruled Trump had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances.
Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232, remain in place.
It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10% global tariff for 150 days.
Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president.
“That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit.
“We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.”
The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip.
Trump sees trade imbalance as national emergency
The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing.
Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said.
Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said.
Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce.
While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier.
Washington announced its largest-ever arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales.
Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump.
Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Trump, and China is the top soybean consumer. Analysts said on Friday that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soybeans after the Supreme Court ruling.
Although Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones.
The global trade war Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies.
Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China.
Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
“Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.</p><small>2026-02-21 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21101849ca0f63f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974667/muttahida-infighting-reaches-sindh-assembly-as-mpa-seeks-protection-from-fellow-member' target='_blank'><strong>Muttahida infighting reaches Sindh Assembly as MPA seeks protection from fellow member</strong></a><br><p>• MQM-P’s Shoukat Ali says he belongs to Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui’s group; accuses Shariq Jamal from former PSP group of threatening him
• Speaker suspends Muttahida’s Engineer Usman over ruckus
• Area SSP, SHO summoned to record MPA’s statement; leave assembly after two sides ‘reconcile’                         
KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Friday rocked by unprecedented infighting within the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan when a party lawmaker, citing threats from a fellow member inside the house, appealed for protection.
The atmosphere abruptly grew tense and dramatic when MQM-P lawmaker Shoukat Ali rose on a point of order, alleging that he had been threatened with dire consequences by his own party colleague, MPA Shariq Jamal.
“Step outside and we’ll see you,” he quoted Mr Jamal as saying to him, and demanded that the relevant police station register a case and guarantee his security, warning that otherwise he would have no choice but to resign.
Taking strong notice of the lawmaker’s allegation, Speaker Syed Awais Shah directed Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia Lanjar to respond to the MQM-P member’s complaint.
The law minister, who also holds the portfolio of home affairs, said that it was not appropriate to raise such matters within the assembly, urging the chair to give a ruling on the matter. 
“If we can’t even protect our own assembly member, then what would happen? This kind of complaint is shameful,” he remarked.
The speaker asked Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi of the MQM-P to resolve the matter before the end of the session, or else he would suspend the membership of the member concerned.
Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that this was a matter of cracks within the MQM-P and that they should protect their members.
The situation further aggravated when another MQM-P member, Engineer Mohammad Usman, started shouting and exchanged heated words with his party members.
A visibly irked speaker announced suspension of his membership and restricted his entry into the Sindh Assembly for creating a ruckus in the house and inciting fellow members to respond.
The speaker ruled that his suspension would remain in effect until he submits a written apology.
Mr Lanjar said that he had arranged security for the member and would take action against those who threatened him. He added that he might record his statement with the police if he wanted to.
MPA Shoukat Ali also told the house that that MQM-P MNA Iqbal Mehsud had come to his office with armed men on Monday and Friday and threatened him. 
He said that this was an internal party matter and that he belonged to the Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui group, while the member threatening him belonged to the former Pak Sarzameen Party group.
However, the opposition leader said that the matter would be resolved as it was not a big issue.
The speaker also called the SSP-South and area SHO at his chamber to record the complaint of the MQM-P member against his own party member. 
However, the two members later reconciled and the police officers left the assembly.
Sharjeel slams ‘hate speeches’ at Governor House event
During the proceedings, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon expressed regret over the choice of words and ideas at a programme held at the Governor House a few days ago.
He said the speakers at this event delivered hateful and linguistically biased speeches, which he condemned in the strongest terms.
Mr Memon emphasised that Karachi had endured bitter experiences of hatred, prejudice and linguistic tension in the past, and similar speeches had previously caused severe and irreparable damage to the city. “Making such statements under these circumstances could pose a serious threat to the city’s peace,” he added.
He further noted that it was unfortunate that, in addition to hateful and biased remarks, some state institutions were criticised inappropriately. “Such discussions in a constitutional and prestigious institution like the Governor House are neither appropriate nor safe for the dignity of the institutions or civic harmony,” he added.
He said that occupying such platforms and delivering biased messages was effectively an attempt to revive an environment that Karachi had already suffered from.
He said that the event and the discussions held at Governor House were against the peace, brotherhood and social harmony of the city and “today the emergence of such a statement by an elected representative of the MQM to another representative of the MQM is a cause for further concern”.
Later, the chair adjourned the sitting to Saturday (today).
Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026</p><small>2026-02-21 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21110214d618447.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974679/babar-shaheen-under-scrutiny-as-pakistan-face-new-zealand-test-in-super-eights-opener' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Shaheen under scrutiny as Pakistan face New Zealand test in Super Eights opener</strong></a><br><p>COLOMBO: The struggles of stalwarts Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi have come under the spotlight as Pakistan eye a winning start to their T20 World Cup Super Eight campaign against New Zealand at the R. Premadasa Stadium here on Saturday.
While Babar failed to deliver in his newly-assumed number four role — barring a decent outing against the USA — during the group stage, Shaheen has emerged as one of Pakistan’s weaker links throughout the tournament so far.
The duo may well take a back seat against the BlackCaps, with the less experienced yet promising Khawaja Nafay and Salman Mirza expected to be entrusted with middle-order batting and new-ball bowling duties, respectively.
On the eve of the fixture, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson laid bare Babar’s vulnerabilities with the bat and hinted the former skipper could contribute only in a specific role, providing context as to why he was not sent in during the last group game against Namibia.
“We think he’s a fine player through the middle, if required, in terms of if we’re in a little bit of trouble, or as we saw against the USA, once he gets himself set, he can increase his strike rate at that point,” said the coach.
“So, we brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted some batsmanship through the middle, and he certainly brings that for us.
“And he did in many games thro­ughout the last 10. So, the other day we got to the 12th over mark and at that point, Babar Azam is not the best person to come in.”
Instead of Babar, Nafay was promoted to bat at four. Although the right-hander did not shine on his World Cup debut, it signalled that Pakistan had made significant adjustments to their initial plans.
“We’ve got plenty of other opti­ons who can come in and perform that role towards the end,” Hesson said.
For Shaheen, who was rushed back into the side following an injury two months ago, the T20 World Cup has been unforgiving. The left-armer, who once struck fear into opening batters, has conceded 11.22 runs per over during the showpiece, having bowled only nine overs in total.
Salman, in contrast, has conceded six runs per over in the two matches he has bowled. The left-arm medium-pacer was dropped after a decent showing against the Netherlands, and missed the following two matches before replacing Shaheen in the Namibia fixture.
The former, however, is likely to be Pakistan’s first choice in the upcoming games.
“We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen,” Hesson said. “He bowled incredibly well. To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games.
“His record since he started playing for Pakistan is exceptional.”
Hesson said Pakistan would continue to back their spin-heavy strategy, at least in Colombo, even if that meant fielding a side packed with all-rounders.
“[Mohammad] Nawaz is one of the best performing spinners in the world in T20 cricket,” said the New Zealander. “Since Shadab Khan came back, his figures have been exceptional.
“Saim Ayub is already in the side and obviously has the ability to bowl the carrom ball. The fact that Usman Tariq has been able to bowl the tough overs through the middle and at the death has been a real advantage for us.”
For New Zealand, meanwhile, the Super Eight stage will test their adaptability, with the side having played all their group matches in India.
Pace, bounce and spin in Colo­mbo are likely to differ markedly from conditions in Chennai and Ahm­edabad, but batter Mark Chap­man said the players were well aware of the variations in pitches.
“I think guys understand what they need to do on slower wickets after playing in India where pitches were batting friendly,” said the middle-order player. “So, we’re pretty confident that we’ll face up to whatever conditions are in front of us.
“A lot of the guys have played a lot of cricket here before.”
Pakistan have played all four of their matches in Sri Lanka and possess a potent spin attack.
Chapman was confident New Zealand could cope with Pakistan’s spinners, including the unorthodox Usman, who pauses in his delivery stride and employs deceptive variations, including side-arm releases.
“Obviously, Tariq has a pretty unique action with the way that he stops at the crease and that’s something to factor in,” Chapman said. “But each of the Pakistan spinners poses their own threat.”

While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.
The consensus created at DawnMedia’s Paki­stan Population Summit last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.
Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.
Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by Pakistan@2050 that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.
The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the Council of Islamic Ideology and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.

Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.

Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous resolution in parliament last August.
If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.
The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.
The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.

 

The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.
The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.
In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.
Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.
It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.

The two sides have exchanged divergent positions on the benefits of a three-year incremental package with a Rs4.04 per unit reduction for industry and the revision of the base tariff from the fiscal year cycle to the calendar year cycle, with effect from January 1, 2026.
The industrial side claims that the package was benefiting only a few industries that were not in operation. Still, larger segments could not avail themselves of the benefits, were already in the process of scaling up, or were in the larger category of B3 and B4, who contributed no loss to the grid but paid more in tariffs.
The industry also contends that even if a Rs4.04 per unit reduction was considered, higher fuel costs resulting from the calendar-year change and quarterly adjustments would nullify that reduction. They claim that Power Division was calculating the diversion of industrial captive power plants from natural gas to the power grid as success for the incremental package.

Business community claims relief lost in translation, amid fuel cost hikes

The Power Division on Friday released two-month data as an overview of the industrial relief package in December 2025 and January. It said a total of 127,686 industrial consumers benefited from the package, receiving cumulative relief of Rs12.125 billion. “This represents 46 per cent of the total 278,961 industrial consumers,” the Power Division said, adding that small and large industries alike received a benefit of Rs10.3 per unit on the consumption of surplus electricity under the package.
It said that during December-January, a total of 1,176 million units of electricity were sold to industries under the surplus package, accounting for 23.80pc of the total industrial units sold during this period. About 557m units of electricity were sold in December under the surplus package, representing 23pc of the total industrial units sold during that month, it added.
This translated into financial relief of Rs5.743 billion for industrial consumers. In December alone, 125,829 consumers benefited from the package, constituting 45pc of total industrial consumers.
In January, 619m units were sold to industries, accounting for 24.5pc of the total under the package. The financial benefit amounted to Rs6.382bn. The number of industrial consumers benefiting in January totalled 127,686, or 46pc of the total. The Power Division said Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari was personally committed to taking positive measures for the industrial sector and was directly overseeing these initiatives through regular reviews and progress updates.
This appeared to be in response to a letter from the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), which welcomed the government’s decision to reduce industrial electricity tariffs to restore industrial competitiveness and export viability.
“However, industry and exporters are alarmed over recent developments that have substantially diluted the intended impact of this relief,” said FPCCI President Atif Ikram Shaikh in a letter to the power minister.
He pointed out that the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for January reflected an increase of approximately Rs1.78 per unit over the reference fuel charges. In addition, the forthcoming quarterly adjustment was expected to add approximately Rs0.40 per unit. Consequently, the effective benefit of the announced Rs4.04 cut for the January billing cycle reduces to nearly Rs1.70-1.80 per unit. This is because the January FCA reference was revised downwards from Rs11.64 to Rs10.40, resulting in a higher cost of Rs1.24 per unit for industrial consumers. “In practical terms, more than half of the announced relief has been neutralised within the same billing period,” the FPCCI chief said.
He highlighted that tariff rebasing was undertaken in July 2025 and again in January. Two structural resets within a short span had intensified tariff volatility and eroded planning certainty for industrial consumers. Exporters have already recalibrated international pricing, secured forward contracts, deployed working capital, and engaged labour based on the expectation of a meaningful and sustained reduction.

One carrier strike group — spearheaded by the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln — is already deployed 700 kilometres off the Iranian shore. It carries a complement of 60-90 aircraft including stealth fighters, attack helicopters and a full electronic warfare suite. Another carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald Ford will be arriving in a week or less. The most advanced US carrier in the fleet, the Ford will add 70-plus aircraft to the tally, along with its advanced radar systems. Both carriers are supported by numerous military vessels, including high-tech destroyers, meaning that about a third of US naval assets are, or will soon be, in a position to strike Iran.
F-15 Strike Eagles, F-35A stealth fighters and F-22 Raptors have been deployed from bases in the UK, Spain and Germany to the Middle East with additional assets en route from the US. More importantly, the US has deployed six out of its 16 E-3 Sentry aircraft to the region. The Sentry is America’s most advanced ‘eye in the sky’ command and control platform capable of airborne surveillance and early warning, with the ability to track over 600 targets simultaneously — aircraft, drones, cruise and ballistic missiles — and effectively coordinates the entire airspace of the battle. It’s a flying super-radar and the mother of all force multipliers rolled into one and it is not deployed lightly or for PR purposes. With its inclusion, the US has deployed a quarter of its entire airpower to the Middle East, making it the largest deployment of US airpower in the region since the 2003 Iraq war. Is all this for show? Is such a massive deployment only a bargaining tool? That’s unlikely at best and delusional at worst. Nor is the build-up limited to offence; anti-missile systems are in place across the region to interdict any missile and drone attacks by Iran on Israel or US bases.
Those who believe the US has no intention of attacking Iran point to the lack of boots on the ground, but that calculation is based on the flawed premise that the US has any intention of occupying Iran. It does not; this would run contrary to the Trumpian way of war: short and sharp conflicts that can be sold as a victory for the president while also showcasing America’s unparalleled military might.

 

It is sufficient for the US to simply bomb away all of Iran’s offensive and defensive capabilities, degrade its command and control, and attempt to isolate, incapacitate or decapitate Iran’s military and political leadership. In that calculus it would open up the way, as the extremist evangelical US Senator Lindsey Graham said “for the Iranian people to stage their own regime change”. With the weakening of central authority, one should expect Kurdish militants and separatists in Sistan-Baluchestan to step up their atta­cks, with the Mujahideen-i-Khalq staging guest appearances. All this will undoubtedly receive not just CIA support but also Mossad’s, which we have seen has deep infiltration in Iran. A beaten, broken and balkanised Iran, along the lines of Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Syria, would suit Israel perfectly; it’s what they want for the entire Middle East, as per the Yinon Plan of the 1980s.

The US has deployed a quarter of its airpower to the Mideast

As for the US, only the naïve would believe that there is a difference between their aims and those of Israel, at least when it comes to Iran, and then there are domestic politics to consider; given the fallout of the Epstein files, with even some Republican politicians calling out President Donald Trump. Would it be hard to imagine that he would start a war as a distraction? Didn’t Bill Clinton bomb Afgh­anistan and Sudan just three days after testifying to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky?
But negotiations are still on between Iran and the US and, yes, there is a non-zero possibility they may succeed. What exactly is on the table? What are the face-saving off-ramps? For Iran to give up its enriched uranium is political and strategic suicide; anything less would be unacceptable to America. And then there is the big picture. China buys up to 80 per cent of Iran’s oil – some 1.38 million barrels a day — amounting to 14pc of China’s seaborne crude oil imports. Taking that off the table, or even disrupting it, amounts to economic warfare against China and can be seen as a prelude to containment, much like Venezuela before it. Because if you actually believe the US is ‘managing’ its decline and is happy to allow China its sphere of influence, then you’re wrong. The US plans to be the dominant global power for the foreseeable future and is acting accordingly. In that pursuit, chaos in Iran is indeed a desirable outcome.

Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026</p><small>2026-02-21 04:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699909a86368a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974738/culture-of-impunity' target='_blank'><strong>Culture of impunity</strong></a><br><p>A RECENT fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths during so-called operations conducted by the Punjab Police’s Crime Control Department, which has allegedly adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”. According to the report, as many as 924 suspects were killed in at least 670 CCD-led encounters across Punjab over eight months in 2025 since the launch of the special branch of police created to curb organised crime and heinous offences. The CCD’s performance has been hailed by Punjab’s political leadership as a great achievement that has protected citizens’ life, property and honour.
However, HRCP has rightly described such killings — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — as “institutionalised practice”. The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022, requires the Federal Investigation Agency to investigate every death in police custody under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights. Inquiries by judicial magistrates are required under Section 174 and 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) in the case of custodial deaths. There’s no evidence that these legal formalities were observed to even try to ‘justify’ such fake encounters. It appears that this police culture of impunity has been perpetrated and patronised by those at the helm of political and security affairs in Pakistan’s largest province.

 

HRCP has pointed to the lack of accountability mechanisms behind the CCD’s cold-blooded violence. A uniform template of allegations is followed: suspects open fire first, police fire back in self-defence, and, under highly improbable circumstances, the suspects are killed in their accomplices’ friendly fire; the dead suspects then turn out to be “hardened criminals”. These have been declared “lethal shortcuts” secured by bypassing proper investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight. HRCP wants an immediate “moratorium” on all encounter operations until legal safeguards and independent accountability mechanisms are established.
After a year’s pre-service training at Police College Sihala in 1977, I was sent to Punjab to serve as assistant superintendent of police at Sheikhupura, Pakpattan and Jhang sub-divisions. Punjab Police has a reputation for using strong-arm tactics against criminals. A tough police chief in Lahore was known as ‘Halaku Khan’. Since the 19th century, Punjab Police’s interrogation techniques have been part of folklore. ‘Effective’ police officers were projected as macho figures in Punjab’s vast hinterlands. There were two types of officers: those who believed that the ends justified the means and harsh and extrajudicial measures were effective crime-control methods; the other smaller group comprised those who believed in the rule of law, due process and adherence to a code that gave primacy to human rights and dignity over brutality.

Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian.

My father’s profession as a lawyer and his being a disciple of Mohammad Ali Jinnah set my course; I chose the path less trodden, which followed the rule of law. As SSP, I was appointed Lahore police chief in 1991; a recent predecessor was said to be an ‘encounter specialist’. The younger brother of the then prime minister was heading a crime control committee for Lahore district. It took me a while to make him understand that crime can be controlled through the painstaking tasks of intelligence collection and professional (and not extra-legal) interrogation of suspects, thorough investigations, collection of credible (and not cooked-up) evidence, assiduous prosecutions and meticulous trials. Over the next two years, the Lahore police took a rule-of-law approach to control crime as the media of those years can testify.

 

The same politician became Punjab chief minister in 1997 and his elder brother the prime minister. On the recommendation of the then inspector-general of police (IGP) and chief secretary, he posted me as DIG of Faisalabad region. Terrorism and sectarian violence were at their peak in those days. The Crime Investigation Department was reorganised and an elite police force created to tackle sectarian violence. The Anti-Terrorism Act was promulgated in 1997, and special speedy trial courts were established. Within two years, hundreds of sectarian terrorists, mainly belonging to Sunni and Shia militant groups were arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated. Sectarian violence came down through lawful measures. Later, the CID was upgraded to the Counter-Terrorism Department and further successes were achieved. Both the political and security establishments achieved the desired results through an approach based on due process and the rule of law.
Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. In the last three years or so, extremely harsh measures have been used against peaceful political protests, and the privacy of homes has been violated. Above all, extrajudicial and custodial killings by the CCD have created an environment of distrust and disgust. The ill-advised promulgation of the Torture and Custodial Death Act in 2022 has not stopped the killer cops from fighting crime by simply eliminating criminals. Will the federal police carry out a scrutiny of the provincial force? I doubt it. They themselves appear to be partners in this crime. The strategy of creating a special crime control department should be re-examined by Punjab’s political leadership. Shortcuts to fighting crime and populist displays of swift justice will backfire. Violence begets violence.
Judicial scrutiny of custodial and extrajudicial killings under Sections 174 and 176 of CrPC is the only way to ensure viable and legal accountability. In our policing days, we were genuinely concerned when high courts took notice of illegal detentions, the misuse of force and deaths in custody. We would not let our juniors run amok. By following the unlawful directions of the ruling elite and deep state, the current police leadership has failed. They must now draw the line and ensure that the police follow the law and enhance their investigative skills and capacity. There are three key public office holders in a province: the IGP, the high court chief justice and the political chief executive. Will they follow the constitutional path or take the illegal course of reckless lawlessness that promotes a culture of impunity? We’ll know the answer for no one can escape scrutiny and eventual accountability that this holy month of fasting and introspection provides to all of us, especially the rulers.

Perhaps the only positive outcome was the news that Pakistan will not be among the five states contributing troops to the International Stabilisation Force to be stationed in Gaza.
Otherwise, there was vague talk of ‘peace’, as well as associated Israeli threats to torpedo the whole plan unless Gaza is demilitarised, which means Hamas giving up its weapons. Billions of dollars have been pledged for the occupied territory, but how many of these promises materialise remains up in the air, as Israel still controls access to the Strip.
Regarding the ISF, an American general will lead the force, while Indonesia has committed around 8,000 troops for the scheme. However, Jakarta has said the mission is “humanitarian”, and that its troops will not be involved in combat roles, precluding any confrontation with Hamas, which US President Donald Trump and Israel insist must be disarmed. Indonesia is aware that any potential confrontation with Palestinian resistance groups will not go down well domestically or in the larger Muslim world.

 

Pakistan has taken the right decision by not committing forces. The BoP and ISF are experimental entities without a clear mandate, apart from establishing ‘peace’ in Gaza, while the possibility of confronting Palestinians and protecting Israeli interests should immediately serve as red flags. Moreover, as per The Guardian, the US intends to build a massive base in Gaza. What is the need for such a facility? Unless there is clarity, the base will represent American occupation of Palestinian land in support of Israel on the sly.
Though plenty of optimism was visible at the Washington meeting, the Palestinians are not so sure this exercise will lead to their liberation and an end to Israeli atrocities. After all, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that that there will be no reconstruction “before the demilitarisation of Gaza”. Unless proved otherwise, Tel Aviv will have an invisible veto at BoP, and all plans will be tailored to its satisfaction, with crumbs thrown at the Palestinians.
Mr Trump told the meeting that “we will help Gaza”. So far no help has been visible as Israel has slaughtered around 600 Palestinians since last October’s ceasefire, while overall the toll of its genocidal violence has crossed 72,000 since October 2023; some studies suggest the toll may be higher. While Muslim states, including Pakistan and Indonesia, spoke for Palestinian rights at the meeting, there were no unambiguous promises from Mr Trump to stop Israel’s land grabs in the West Bank — moves that a recent UN report has said resemble ethnic cleansing. Hence, expecting the BoP to chart a roadmap towards Palestinian liberation is a fallacy.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court on Friday dismissed multiple petitions challenging the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, ruling that the provincial levy on construction services does not contravene constitutional provisions governing the division of taxation powers between the federal and provincial governments.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a two-judge FCC bench addressed a number of challenges against a May 13, 2025, Peshawar High Court judgement.
Petitioners including M/s Matracon Pakistan (Private) Limited, Anwar Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Khan, Zhongmei-Al Mehreen Joint Venture, Merryland Housing Society Mardan and Subhan Smart City Society Mardan had challenged Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the act.
The challenged provision imposed a 2 per cent sales tax on services provided by construction contractors, architects, civil engineers, property promoters, developers, planners, interior decorators and allied professions.
It specifically covers construction services relating to structures, buildings, roads, bridges, underpasses, flyovers, electro-mechanical works, turn-key projects, and engineering, procurement and construction contracts.
Show-cause notices issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority demanded tax for the period from July 2021 to April 2022 on amounts received by the petitioners pursuant to construction contracts, which included the price of goods to be provided by the contractors.
The legal question before the FCC was whether Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 was unconstitutional.

 

The judgement observed that after examining Entry 49 of the Constitution — which states “taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed, except sales tax on services” — the court found no inconsistency between the impugned law and the Constitution.
Entry 49 clearly stipulates that taxes on services cannot be imposed by the federation and the impugned law conforms to this mandate by imposing sales tax exclusively on construction services, the court said.
While the FCC acknowledged the petitioners’ concern that the revenue authority was levying tax on entire contractual amounts, it noted that Section 2(a) of the act defines “input tax” as cost incurred in the utilisation of goods for the execution of services.
The law allows registered persons to claim adjustments and refunds regarding tax paid under any other law on goods used in providing taxable services.
The FCC also addressed an ancillary matter regarding its jurisdiction to hear tax references not expressly enumerated in the Constitution. It held that Article 175E(5) of the Constitution authorises the FCC to call for the record of any case where a substantial question of constitutional interpretation arises.
The FCC observed that some constitutional provisions were “character-conferring” and also “competence-enumerating”. Article 175E(5) is of this kind, it said.
The court held that Article 175E(5) authorises the FCC to adjudicate matters involving substantial questions of constitutional interpretation, even in the absence of express jurisdiction. In the present case, the court said such a question squarely arose in the form of a challenge to the vires of the law.
The FCC concluded that Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, was not ultra vires the Constitution. The judgement explained that the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, when considered together, show no inconsistency.

The oath was administered by AJK Chief Justice Raja Saeed Akram at a ceremony held in the Supreme Court building, attended by members of the legal fraternity and senior civil servants.
The office fell vacant following the expiry of the term of retired Justice Abdul Rashid Sulehria on January 13 last year.
Justice Mughal’s appointment was notified by the AJK government on Wednesday after the President’s office received advice in his favour from the chairman of the AJK Council — the prime minister of Pakistan.
Justice Mughal, who is over 70, previously served as CEC from February 2016 to February 2019 while he was a serving judge — first of the AJK High Court and later of the Supreme Court.
The long-delayed appointment is expected to allay concerns about the timely conduct of AJK’s next general elections, scheduled for July this year.
At the swearing-in ceremony, Justice Mughal declined to take up questions from journalists, saying he would invite media after receiving detailed briefings from election commission officials.

LAHORE: The Crime Control Department (CCD), Punjab, said a comparative review of crime data for the post-May period of 2024 and 2025 showed a significant reduction in crime across Punjab, particularly in Lahore.
According to the CCD, the department commenced operations in Punjab in May last year and held a meeting to review its performance in crime control.
It stated that the provincial capital, Lahore, recorded some of the most pronounced crime reductions in its history.
The CCD said the murder cases fell from 361 to 220 (39pc), while attempted murder declined from 812 to 504 (38pc). Incidents of dacoity dropped from 35 to 15 (57pc), and house dacoity from 33 to 6 (82pc).
Robbery saw the sharpest decline, dropping from 8,213 to 1,823 — a 78pc reduction. Theft within boundary walls fell by 9pc and burglary by 44pc, while motorcycle and car snatching decreased by 69pc and 50pc, respectively.
Punjab recorded significant declines across major crime categories, with murders falling from 3,952 to 3,022 (24pc) and attempted murder down 18pc. Dacoity and robbery dropped by 60pc and 53pc, while theft within boundary walls and burglary decreased by 17pc and 27pc, respectively.
This reduction, however, was not without cost. Across the province, 19 police officers embraced martyrdom, and 167 personnel —including 13 CCD members — sustained firearm-related or other serious operational injuries, according to CCD Punjab.
HRCP findings rejected
Meanwhile, the CCD has rejected allegations made in a fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), terming claims of staged encounters and extrajudicial actions as unfounded and contrary to the department’s operational framework.
The HRCP in its fact-finding report on CCD encounters in Punjab called for an urgent judicial inquiry into related deaths. It said that at least 670 encounters were conducted over eight months in 2025, resulting in 924 suspects killed, while two police officials lost their lives.
In a press release, the CCD stated that it does not follow any policy of staged encounters and operates strictly within the Constitution of Pakistan, the Police Order 2002 and applicable criminal procedure laws. The department maintained that arrest remains the primary objective of its operations and that the use of force is governed by the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.
The CCD said lethal force is employed only as a last resort in situations involving armed resistance and imminent danger to life. It added that Punjab faces a complex security environment in which criminal gangs and organised groups often possess automatic weapons and engage law enforcement personnel with lethal intent, compelling officers to act in self-defence to protect themselves and civilians.
Responding to concerns about abuse of authority, the department acknowledged that any misconduct by individual officers is unacceptable.
According to the statement, officers found involved in corruption, abuse of power, or professional misconduct are being proceeded against under departmental and criminal laws without discrimination.

A two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Ayesha A. Malik took up an appeal filed by the finance ministry challenging the FST’s June 26, 2025 order along with an application seeking condonation of a 20-day delay in filing the petition.
Authored by Justice Malik, the four-page judgement described the 20-day delay as inexcusable and criticised the state’s casual approach towards statutory timelines.
The state enforces the law against citizens and expects compliance within prescribed timelines; therefore, it must also hold itself to the same standard, she emphasised.

Observes state is just like any other litigant and must comply with statutory timelines

Through the application, the finance ministry sought condonation of delay, explaining that the case was under process with the deputy secretary (Litigation-II) and awaiting approval from a CPLA committee, which could not be convened due to an insufficient number of cases for deliberation.
It further explained that once the caseload increased and approval was obtained, the draft was sent to the Law and Justice Division for vetting. The division suggested changes, and by the time the final draft was prepared, the limitation period had expired.
Justice Malik observed that if the state were permitted to disregard statutory timeframes on account of its internal inefficiencies, it would create an imbalance in the administration of justice and undermine the constitutional guarantee of equality before the law.
When the state fails to comply with these timelines and seeks indulgence for administrative delay, it transfers the consequences of its disorganisation onto the court and the opposing party, which is often in a weaker position, the judgement emphasised. It added that good governance requires institutional functioning through clear responsibility, internal discipline and adherence to the law.
If compliance depends on convenience rather than structured systems, delays become routine and accountability diminishes. The courts cannot condone such delays without weakening the expectation that the state must maintain efficient systems capable of meeting its legal obligations. Enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence, the judgement observed.

 

Such delay is inexcusable, particularly when no effort has been made to reform or improve the procedure causing the delay, the verdict noted, adding that the state must organise itself to function in a timely manner and meet legal deadlines rather than seeking indulgence for its own inefficiencies.
The judgement observed that enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence that the law applies equally to all under Article 25 of the Constitution.
In this context, the prescribed timeline under the SC rules is 60 days. When a statutory timeframe is set, it is meant to ensure diligence and prevent disputes from remaining indefinitely pending.
If internal file movement, committee scheduling constraints or staff shortages are accepted as sufficient cause, the statutory framework would become flexible at the convenience of the litigant, defeating the very purpose of limitation, which is to ensure certainty and predictability in the administration of justice. The court emphasised that limitation is not merely a technical requirement but carries substantive importance.
Every litigant, including the petitioner, is required to adhere to the prescribed timelines, failing which the remedy stands extinguished unless sufficient cause is shown.
“We find that the explanation provided in the application for condonation of delay is insufficient and reflects a very casual approach towards the prescribed limitation,” the judgement observed.
Consequently, the application for condonation of delay was dismissed and, as a result, the petition itself was dismissed as time-barred.

• With only one conviction in US, legislators accuse justice dept of dragging its feet• Most Americans now find leaders ‘untrustworthy’• Australian PM says referendums ‘hard to pass’ after Andrew’s arrest
WASHINGTON: The arrest of former prince Andrew has underlined the striking contrast bet­ween Europe, where high-profile, powerful people are being held to account over their links to Jeffrey Epstein, and the United States, where the fallout has been limited.
Only one person has been arrested or convicted in the United States in connection with the activities of the late sex offender — Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and accomplice.
Epstein cultivated a global network of powerful politicians, business executives, academics and celebrities — many of whom have been tainted by their association with him.
A number of prominent Americans — from former president Bill Clinton to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates — have had their reputations damaged by their friendships with Epstein, but no one other than Maxwell has faced legal consequences.
A top US Justice Department official suggested recently that no prosecutions may be forthcoming. “I can’t talk about any investigations, but I will say the following, which is that in July, the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the files, the Epstein files, and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CNN earlier this month.
That explanation has not satisfied many US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, who accuse the Trump Justice Department of dragging its feet.
“The UK has officially done more to prosecute Epstein predators than our own government. Shameful,” Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, said on X.
Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, blamed the lack of accountability in the US squarely on Trump, who also was a close friend of Epstein and moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York.
“Countries across the world are holding their Epstein class accountable,” Gallego said on X. “It isn’t happening in America because we have a pedo protector in the Oval Office running a government cover-up for him and his friends.”







A Reuters/Ipsos poll found 53 per cent Americans say the Epstein files “lowered their trust in the country’s political and business leaders”, while 69pc told pollsters the Epstein files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions”.
Republican lawmaker Thomas Massie welcomed prince Andrew’s arrest but said “now we need justice in the US”.
Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pla­yed down the chance of a vote to remove the British monarch as Australia’s head of state following the arrest of former prince Andrew.
“I’m a republican but we had a referendum during the last term. Referendums are hard to pass in Australia,” Albanese said when asked in an interview with The Guardian whether Australia should reassess its ties with the monarchy.

FORMER captain Michael Vaughan has urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to “act fast” on reports that Pakistani players will be overlooked by Indian-owned teams in the domestic Hundred competition.
The issue could be a factor during next month’s player auction for English cricket’s Hundred, a 100 balls-per-side competition featuring eight franchises rather than the traditional 18 first-class counties.
BBC Sport and The Telegraph have reported that with four of the eight franchises in the upcoming tournament owned by companies that control teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), it is “an unwritten rule” that Pakistani players would not be considered for those team.
According to the BBC, a senior ECB official indicated to an agent that interest in his Pakistan players would be limited to sides not linked to the IPL.
Vaughan, referencing the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country, posted on Friday on X: “The ECB need to act fast on this … they own the league, and this should not be allowed to happen … The most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen.”







The Pakistan Cricket Board has not commented on the situation so far.
Politics, not sport
Longstanding political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the rivals only playing each other in international cricket events, although their recent Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka only went ahead after Pakistan called off a boycott.
Politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League, world cricket’s most lucrative T20 franchise competition.
And with several IPL owners now owning teams in several different countries, opportunities for Pakistani cricketers to participate in various leagues are in danger of being reduced further.
Players will go under the hammer in London on March 11-12, with the BBC reporting that the four Indian-affiliated Hundred teams — Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds — will deliberately avoid selecting players from Pakistan.
Two Pakistani international players — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred tournament, which was the final edition before new investors took control.
Others — including Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf — featured in earlier seasons of the men’s competition. No Pakistan players have appeared in the women’s Hundred.
‘Systemic isolation’
The BBC highlighted the exclusion of Pakistan players in what it called “a growing trend in franchise cricket”.
No Pakistanis have featured in South Africa’s SA20, which launched in 2023. All six of its teams are owned by IPL franchise groups — including the four now involved in The Hundred.
In the UAE’s ILT20, franchises controlled by the owners of MI London and Southern Brave have not signed a Pakistan player across four seasons, but have recruited cricketers from 15 other nationalities.
By contrast, American-owned ILT20 side Desert Vipers have signed eight Pakistan players over the same period.
Commenting on the development, BBC cricket pundit Aatif Nawaz said “There is no merit-based reason for Pakistani players to be excluded from any franchise T20 competition”.
“Call it what it really is: systemic isolation,” he wrote on X.







According to the BBC, the ECB sold its 49pc stakes in each of the eight Hundred franchises last year — raising £500m in private investment that has since been distributed to counties and the grassroots game.
The ECB retains control of the competition itself, with a new board featuring team representatives formed to help shape its strategic direction.
The tournament also remains under the jurisdiction of the independent cricket regulator — established following the 2023 Equity in Cricket report, which found discrimination to be “widespread” within the English game.
The BBC quoted the County Cricket Members’ Group as saying: “We expect the relevant county boards and the ECB to hold private partners accountable if there is any reason to believe the non-selection of Pakistan players was a blanket decision based on nationality.”

WASHINGTON: After the US Supreme Court struck down the President’s sweeping tariffs that he pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies, Donald Trump announced on Friday he was imposing an extra global tariff of 10 per cent on US trade partners.
The conservative-majority court ruled the emergency powers law — International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”, marking Trump’s biggest defeat at the SC since returning to the White House last year.
While hard-hit Canada welcomed the ruling pointing out the levies were always “unjustified”, other US trading partners particularly European powers were cautious in their response, with the UK, Germany and EU stating that they were in contact with the Trump administration and analysing the court decision ‘carefully’.
Trump insisted he would impose tariffs “using alternative authorities” after rebuking certain members of the court for lacking the courage to do what’s right for the country.
He suggested that most trade deals negotiated under the threat of his tariffs remained valid, mentioning specifically India, despite the SC ruling those levies illegal. “The India deal is on,” Trump told reporters in response to a question, while suggesting tariffs under separate authorities would replace the ones overturned by the court. “All the deals — we’re just going to do it a different way.”
“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,” the president asserted.
“The Supreme Court’s decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less,” he claimed while speaking to reporters after the 6-3 ruling upheld a lower court’s decision that the Republican president’s use of the 1977 law “exceeded his authority”.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.
Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
However, Trump’s administration has not provided tariffs collection data since Dec 14, 2025.
Powers to issue taxes, tariffs
The Supreme Court reached its conclusion in a legal challenge by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-governed, against Trump’s unprecedented use of this law to unilaterally impose the import taxes.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress.
“Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs” with IEEPA, “it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes,” the court noted
The SC’s three liberal justices joined three conservatives in Friday’s ruling, which upheld lower court decisions that tariffs Trump imposed under IEEPA were illegal.
Trump heaped praise on Brett Kavanaugh, the only justice he nominated who voted with him. Kavanaugh was joined in his dissent by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
Chief Justice John Roberts, in delivering his opinion, said, “IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.”
Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.
IEEPA lets a president regulate commerce in a national emergency.
Trump became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials, domestic military deployments and military operations overseas.
He described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenseless and ruined without them.
Post-ruling strategy
In November, Trump told reporters that without his tariffs “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us”. He said the United States was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.
After the SC heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan”.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.
Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against American exporters.
None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.
Trump’s ability to impose tariffs instantaneously on any trading partner’s goods under the aegis of some form of declared national emergency raised his leverage over other countries.
It brought world leaders scrambling to Washington to secure trade deals that often included pledges of billions of dollars in investments or other offers of enhanced market access for US companies.
But Trump’s use of tariffs as a cudgel in US foreign policy has succeeded in antagonising numerous countries, including those long considered among the closest US allies.
IEEPA historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. The law does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Estimates
Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists estimated that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act stood at more than $175 billion. And that amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.
The Congressional Bud­get Office has estimated that if all current tariffs stay in place, including the IEEPA-based duties, they would generate about $300bn annually over the next decade.
Total US net customs duty receipts reached a record $195bn in fiscal 2025, which ended on Sept 30, according to US Trea­sury Department data.
In February and March of 2025, Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.
Trump has wielded his tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a weapon to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariffs ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
Reactions to ruling
The EU said on Friday that it was studying the US Supreme Court ruling. “We take note of the ruling … and are analysing it carefully,” EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said.
“We remain in close contact with the US Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,” he added.
“Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship”.
The British government spokesperson said Britain planned to work with the US to see how the overturning of Trump’s tariffs by the US Supreme Court would affect the trade deal between the two countries. “We will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world,” the spokesperson said, adding that the UK expects its “privileged trading position with the US to continue”.
The Canadian minister responsible for US trade said the US Supreme Court’s ruling affirms that the levies were “unjustified”.
International Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc noted, however, that tariffs causing the most pain in Canada — sector-specific measures affecting the steel, aluminum and auto industries — remained in force despite the ruling, promising Ottawa would work with Washington to “create growth and opportunities on both sides of the border”.
After the ruling, stock markets rose in the United States and Europe, led by shares of affected companies, including Europe’s luxury brands from LVMH to Hermes and Italian luxury outerwear group Moncler, all of which rose after the ruling.
Stocks rise
US and European stocks advanced on Friday and Treasury yields rose as investors absorbed the Supreme Court ruling, while also parsing a weak GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data.
All three major US stock indexes moved higher immediately following the Supreme Court’s decision. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on track to notch weekly gains, while the blue-chip Dow is currently flat versus last Friday’s close.
Europe’s STOXX 600 index extended gains following the ruling while gold prices came off the day’s highs in the immediate aftermath.
US Treasury yields rose following the Supreme Court’s ruling. The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes added 1.9 basis points to 4.094pc, from 4.075pc late on Thursday.
The dollar turned lower after the top US court’s tariff decision, but was still on track for its biggest weekly gain since October.

The SPI-based inflation has now increased for 29 consecutive weeks, underscoring persistent pressure on household budgets. The continued upward movement has largely been driven by a sharp rise in the prices of vegetables and other perishables, as well as higher electricity and petrol rates. On a week-on-week basis, the SPI edged up by 1.16pc from the previous week, official data showed on Friday.
The increase was attributed mainly to stronger demand for essential food items during the month of Ramazan, which traditionally leads to higher consumption and short-term price pressures. 
The latest figures suggest that food and energy remain the principal contributors to inflationary trends, with perishable goods particularly sensitive to supply constraints and seasonal demand patterns.

SPI rises 5.19pc year-on-year, driven by higher food and energy prices

An extraordinary surge in the retail prices of sugar and meat has also played a decisive role in reversing the easing trend witnessed in recent weeks. Meat prices, in particular, have been climbing steadily, adding further strain on household budgets already under pressure from elevated food and energy costs.
Weekly inflation had earlier reached a historic high of 48.35 per cent YoY in early May 2023. It subsequently moderated in the following years. The latest movement in sugar, edible oil, pulses, and meat prices suggests that volatility in essential food commodities continues to shape short-term inflation trends, with consumers facing recurring cycles of price spikes.
The items, whose prices increased the most over the previous week included bananas (16.05pc), electricity charges for Q1 (15.41pc), garlic (5.86pc), chicken (5.49pc), onions (3.83pc), tomatoes (3.82pc), diesel (2.69pc), petrol (1.93pc), beef (1.03pc), LPG (0.75pc), mutton (0.69pc) and long cloth (0.28pc).
The items whose prices saw a decline week-on-week included eggs (11.78pc), potatoes (2.24pc), wheat flour (2.02pc), pulse masoor (1.47pc), sugar (0.96pc), vegetable ghee 2.5Kg (0.72pc), pulse gram (0.58pc), cooking oil 5 litre (0.19pc), gur (0.16pc), vegetable ghee 1kg (0.11pc), rice IRRI-6/9 (0.08pc) and mustard oil (0.07pc).
However, on an annual basis, the items whose prices increased the most tomatoes (85.20pc), wheat flour (31.33pc), gas charges for Q1 (29.85pc), electricity charges for Q1 (17.33pc), bananas (15.83pc), chilies powder (15.20pc), beef (13.28pc), LPG (12.22pc), firewood (11.40pc), powdered milk (9.89pc), shirting (9.11pc), mutton (8.77pc) and gur (8.63pc).
In contrast, the prices of potatoes dropped 45.43pc, followed by garlic (27.51pc), pulse gram (23.30pc), chicken (19.36pc), onions (18.10pc), Lipton tea (13.95pc), salt powder (12.52pc), pulse masoor (12.33pc), eggs (8.54pc), pulse mash (5.08pc), mustard oil (2.13pc), sugar (1.43pc) and pulse moong (1.40pc).
The index, comprising 51 items collected from 50 markets in 17 cities, is computed weekly to assess the prices of essential commodities and services at shorter intervals. Data showed that the prices of 17 items increased, 12 decreased, and 22 remained stable compared to the previous week.

The session, which began 45 minutes late under the chairmanship of Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, started with the recitation of the Holy Quran.
The resolution was moved by JUI-F MPA Asghar Ali Tareen, who stated that although Balochistan was Pakistan’s largest province by area and rich in natural resources, it remained underdeveloped and beset by numerous challenges. He argued that meaningful representation was essential to addressing the province’s problems.
The resolution recommended that the provincial government approach the Centre to ensure practical steps were taken to increase the number of seats in the Balochistan Assembly from 65 to 85, and in the National Assembly from 20 to 28. The move, the resolution stated, wou­ld help reduce public anxiety and feelings of marginalisation in the province.

Provincial assembly unanimously adopts resolution for greater share in legislatures keeping vast geography in view

Vast geography
Speaking on the resolution, Mr Tareen pointed out that a single National Assembly constituency in Balochistan was geographically equivalent to an entire district in Punjab. He added that Rakhshan Division’s National Assembly constituency in the province covered an area comparable to the whole of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He noted that legislation to increase Balochistan’s representation was previously considered for inclusion in the 27th Constitutional Amendment but was not ultimately incorporated. He added that since the PPP and the PML-N were coalition partners in both the province and at the federal level, it was an opportune time to amend the Constitution to enhance Balochistan’s representation.
Provincial Planning and Development Minister Mir Zahoor Buledi said Balochistan had not received the attention it deserved in the past.
He suggested that, instead of a marginal increase, the number of National Assembly seats should be expanded by more than 40 overall.
Opposition Leader in the House Mir Younis Aziz Zehri supported the resolution, calling it vital for the province’s interests. He stressed that beyond passing the resolution, practical implementation was necessary. He also criticised past census results, claiming that Balochistan’s population had been undercounted, and remarked that out of 362 National Assembly seats, the province’s share was negligible.
Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Muhammad Sadiq Umrani highlighted that an area in Nasirabad with a population of 600,000 lacked representation in the NA.
He urged the Balochistan Assembly speaker to form a committee to present the province’s case before the federal government with solid arguments.
Members from the National Party, ANP and other political parties also backed the resolution.
A proposal was also made to form a parliamentary committee under the leadership of the chief minister to engage with the federal government on the issue.
With broad cross-party support, the House unanimously approved the resolution, marking a significant step in renewed efforts to enhance Balochistan’s political representation at both provincial and national levels.

• Offers cooperation on critical minerals
• Premier meets regional leaders, IDFC chief
WASHINGTON: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a two-day visit to Washington on Friday, securing a US pledge to cooperate on crit­ical minerals and energy after aligning his country with a US President Donald Trump-led Gaza peace initiative and praising his role in defusing a regional crisis last year.
PM Shehbaz met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday to discuss shifting the bilateral rela­tionship toward economic inv­es­tment while maintaining a partnership in counterterrorism, acco­rding to a State Depart­ment statement.
In their meeting, Rubio thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for its role as a founding member of the “Board of Peace”, which held its inaugural session on Thursday.
The State Department said Rubio also offered condolences for recent terror attacks in Pakistan and “reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counterterrorism”.
The ‘meaningful’ discussions cov­ered Pakistan’s recent participation in the Critical Minerals Min­­isterial in Washington, with the US welcoming Islamabad’s eng­a­gement and discussing commercial opportunities for Ameri­can companies in the country’s energy and mineral resources.
According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, both sides reaffirmed the importance of Pakistan-US strategic ties and expressed satisfaction with the partnership’s progress under President Trump.
They agreed to boost trade, expand economic cooperation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts, while emphasising the need for continued high-level engagement to advance shared goals.

‘A saviour of South Asia’
PM Shehbaz also credited Trump with de-escalating a four-day military crisis between Pakistan and India in May. He called the president “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”, whose intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people”.
Speaking at the summit, Trump recounted his actions during that conflict, saying he warned both countries that the US would halt trade negotiations and could impose steep tariffs.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” Trump said, adding that the economic threat helped achieve a de-escalation.
A notable moment at the summit came when Trump devoted nearly four minutes of his address to praising Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership for their “constructive and responsible role for regional peace and stability”, referencing his meeting with PM Shehbaz and the Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
Meeting with regional leaders
According to Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several leaders in Washington for the Board of Peace session, including the king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and the presidents of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.
It described Pakistan’s participation in the board as part of its broader effort to support peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives and “global peace”.
Separately, APP reported that PM Shehbaz met the chief executive of the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), Benjamin Black, on Friday. The premier praised the portfolio of more than $1bn and urged closer business-to-business engagement, while Black outlined the agency’s project pipeline and signalled interest in expanding the IDFC footprint in Pakistan.
Officials played down expectations of major agreements, suggesting the visit was aimed more at setting a direction than producing headline deals.

The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15.
Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.”
After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”.
“I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator.
Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials.
“We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW.
“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added.
His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level.
Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy.
Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities.
‘No ultimatum’
The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities.
Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks.
On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out.
“We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats.
Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”.
“We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said.
“We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”.
Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks.
The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged.
Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region.
After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East.
Subsequently, the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday.
The carrier was seen transiting the Strait of Gibraltar — which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean — in a photo taken from the Gibraltar side of the strait.
Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.</p><small>2026-02-20 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20225341a351d54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974608/imran-to-be-taken-to-hospital-two-more-times-will-be-administered-injection-on-feb-25-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imran to be taken to hospital two more times, will be administered injection on Feb 25: minister</strong></a><br><p>Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Friday that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would be taken to a hospital twice in the coming days and that he had to be administered an injection on February 25.
The ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
The matter was raised again during ARY News programme ‘Sawal Yeh Hai’, where Chaudhry was asked what was the obstacle in the way of Imran’s personal physicians gaining access to him.







In his response, Chaudhry said: “Our top priority is to provide him the best treatment facilities. We previously took him to Pims as well, but in secrecy due to his security.”
He added that Imran was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the advice of doctors who had examined the former prime minister in jail and suggested that he should be treated at a tertiary care hospital.
“We have to again take him to the hospital twice,” Chaudhry said, assuring that he would be provided the best possible medical facilities.
He added that the government had invited the PTI leadership to be present during an examination of Imran at the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is imprisoned, on February 15.
“But they could not decide which leadership to send,” he said, indicating a divide within the PTI. The minister also claimed that PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan’s name was proposed for the visit, but “objections were raised”.
“So they can decide. Imran Khan sahib has to be administered an injection on February 25. If they want to come, they are most welcome. There is no secrecy,” he added.
He also assured that since Imran was in jail at present, the responsibility of his health and treatment lay with the government and the state. “And realising this, we are providing him the best possible facilities.”
The minister again insisted that the government had invited Barrister Gohar in connection with Imran’s treatment and examination and claimed that his “party did not allow him to go”.
He reasserted that a member of Imran’s family, Barrister Gohar and Imran’s personal physician had been invited during his last examination.
“We will try to invite them this time as well during his treatment, but first, they need to decide who will come. Because we waited for around one and a half to two hours, but they did not come,” he added.
Asked if a request was made for Imran’s personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf to be allowed access to him on February 25, would it be accepted, Chaudhry replied that the PTI had been insisting on allowing access to Dr Sultan, but he was not an ophthalmologist.
On January 24, it was revealed that the PTI founder had undergone a 20-minute medical procedure for his eye ailment at Pims, resulting in concerns being raised by the opposition and Imran’s family, who continue to face restrictions on meetings with the incarcerated former premier.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye.
A report prepared by a medical board formed by the government that visited Imran on February 15 at the Adiala jail stated that, unaided, the ex-premier’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health, also doubled down on its earlier demands on Friday.
These included Imran’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports.
Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan have previously said multiple times that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.</p><small>2026-02-20 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/202157067190315.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974600/over-31m-births-registered-with-ucs-yet-to-be-added-to-nadras-central-database-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>Over 31m births registered with UCs yet to be added to Nadra’s central database, says report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Around 31.9 million births registered with union councils (UC) in 2025 are yet to be added to the record in the National Database and Registration Authority’s (Nadra) central database, according to an annual performance report.
The report was recently submitted by Nadra to the interior ministry, according to which a total of 227m individuals are registered with the authority.
Overall, nearly 97 per cent of Pakistan’s population is now included in the registration system, according to the report, which also shows that 52pc of the registered individuals are males and 48pc are females.
As for biometric data, Nadra’s system contains facial records of 170m people, iris data of seven million individuals and 1.68 billion fingerprints, the reports says.
During 2025 alone, the report states, some 445m biometric verifications were carried out, contributing to “improved transparency” and “strengthening of digital governance systems”.
According to the report, national registration increased by 4pc in 2025, registration of children under the age of 18 rose by 11pc, renewal of expired identity cards increased by 24pc and cancellation of identity cards following death registration surged by 900pc. Female registration also saw an 8pc rise during the year.
The reports says that by end of the year, 938 registration centres were operational nationwide. The authority established 75 new centres 138 new counters, while another 126 counters were installed at existing offices.
The reports say that 231 mobile registration vans remained active during the year, including 33 satellite-equipped units for remote areas.
At the UC level, 62 registration counters were operational while six new counters were set up in five countries abroad to facilitate overseas Pakistanis.
According to the report, the Pak Identity mobile application was used to handle 15pc of Nadra’s total workload. The app was downloaded more than 12m times, enabling citizens to access services without visiting registration centres.
In 2025, the federal government approved the National Registration and Biometric Policy Framework to further strengthen the unified registration system. Amendments to national identity card regulations were also introduced, biometric child registration certificates were launched for children as young as three, and family registration certificates were granted formal legal status.
According to the report, Pakistan’s identity registration system now has near-complete coverage, though efforts are still required to further improve the registration of women and young children in certain areas.
Clear policy recommendations have been proposed to close the remaining gaps entirely, the report says.</p><small>2026-02-20 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2016592893c6601.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974588/sc-stays-trial-of-pm-shehbazs-rs10bn-defamation-suit-against-imran' target='_blank'><strong>SC stays trial of PM Shehbaz’s Rs10bn defamation suit against Imran</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) stayed on Friday a trial by the court of an additional district judge in Lahore in a RS10 billion defamation suit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against PTI founder Imran Khan.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for the recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for the publication of defamatory content.
The defamation suit said Imran wrongly accused PM Shehbaz of offering Rs10bn to the latter through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the Panama Papers case.
The PTI founder had contended in his reply that he had disclosed the alleged incident for the consumption of the public at large, and an act in the interest of the public good did not constitute any defamation. He maintained that he did not specifically attribute any statement to the PM Shehbaz while narrating the incident.
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Ayesha A Malik and including Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, took up a set of review petitions filed by Imran in the case.
The court also issued a notice to the respondent as no one was present on behalf of PM Shehbaz and directed the court office to fix the case for a hearing at the earliest.
Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, who was representing Imran, argued before the SC that his client could not appear before the trial court as he was injured after being shot in the leg, referring to an assassination attempt on the former premier in November 2022.
Zafar said the trial court had closed the right to defend despite previously acknowledging the PTI founder’s injury.
Now, a trial court has commenced recording evidence and testimonies of witnesses in the case, the counsel said.
At that, Justice Malik wondered how the trial court had “terminated the right to defence” after acknowledging that Imran had been injured.
Subsequently, the SC issued a notice to the respondent and directed the court office fix the review petitions for hearing at the earliest.
Imran had filed review petitions in the case after the trial court had close the right to defence — a decision that was upheld by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and endorsed by the SC on February 21, 2023.
The trial court, through its order on October 20, 2022, had dismissed Imran’s objections in the case over the rejection of PM Shehbaz’s interrogatories — a set of written questions served by one party to the other — and directed the PTI founder to submit his answers.
Later, through a subsequent order of November 24, 2022, the trial court struck off the right of defence due to the non-submission of answers to the interrogatories.
Previously, the SC had held in a 2-1 majority judgment in the case that Imran had been “wilfully contumacious and disobedient” throughout the trial court proceedings and that the trial court had not committed any “illegality or material irregularity” in the exercise of its jurisdiction through its orders of closing the right to defend.
The LHC had also rightly declined to interfere in its revisional jurisdiction, former judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had observed at the time in the judgement authored by him.
He had made these observations as the court heard an appeal moved by Imran challenging the December 7, 2022 LHC order of upholding the sessions court’s closure of Imran’s right to defend.
Justice Malik, who was also a member of that bench, had dissented from the majority judgement. She had held that in a case plagued by adjournments since 2017, the court must weigh the balance between a fair trial and the legitimate grounds for the request for adjournment.
She had observed that Imran’s public shooting and subsequent injury at a political rally justified the grant of an adjournment for a reasonable time under the circumstances, adding that the right to defence could not be struck off without considering all relevant factors.
Justice Malik had further stated that the trial court’s order sheet showed it had proceeded in a “mechanical manner” and granted numerous adjournments without so much as imposing costs so as to discourage the same.
“No doubt the courts are overburdened with work, and judges are faced with the daunting task of handling a vast number of cases every day; nevertheless, it is the court’s responsibility to manage each case before it diligently by applying the provisions of the procedural law,” she had observed.
She added that the striking off of the petitioner’s right to defence at that stage, while ignoring the legitimate factors in play, would be a “gross injustice”.
The balancing act of justice must be upheld, and under these circumstances, the right to a fair defence must prevail, Justice Malik had observed while setting aside the trial court order and remanding the matter again to the trial court to grant a reasonable opportunity to the petitioner to file answers to the interrogatories.
On the other hand, Justice Shah had observed that Imran’s conduct disentitled him from the indulgence of this court in its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 185(3) of the Constitution.
He added that his appeal was without substance on merits.
He had observed that interrogatories served as a useful tool to shorten litigation and reduce expenses. However, he added that the process of interrogatories had unfortunately been “abused in the present case and, in fact, misused to prolong the trial”.
The former SC judge had said that such “abuse of the process of interrogatories has to be curbed with a heavy hand”.
The fair use of the process of interrogatories should be encouraged, for it would result in saving considerable time and money, and would thus be beneficial to the parties of the case as well as to the administration of justice in general, Justice Shah had observed.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20185025b89313b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974592/pti-assails-pm-shehbaz-for-attending-bop-meeting-reiterates-objection-to-joining-without-consultation' target='_blank'><strong>PTI assails PM Shehbaz for attending BoP meeting, reiterates objection to joining without consultation</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Friday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for attending the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, and reiterating its objection to Pakistan joining the board without consultation.
The Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 and originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza — held its inaugural meeting on February 19, attended by several world leaders, including PM Shehbaz.
In a statement posted on X, the party said it once again expressed “grave concern over the government of Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace without transparency, parliamentary debate, or consultation with major political stakeholders of the country”.
“Decisions of such international significance must be rooted in constitutional procedure, democratic oversight and national consensus,” it said.







The party maintained that it did not recognise the legitimacy of the present Parliament, formed after the “manipulated 2024 elections”.
“Nevertheless, even this Parliament was bypassed in this decision-making process, further eroding democratic norms and public trust,” it said.
Drawing a contrast with former premier Imran Khan, the party said that he had “been among the most steadfast and vocal supporters of Palestinian rights on the global stage”.
“His position on Palestine has always been clear and uncompromising,” it added. The party said that it stood “firmly with the Palestinian people and categorically rejects any plan imposed without their consent”.
It reiterated its unwavering support for a just and lasting resolution through an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and long-standing PTI policy.
It said that Pakistan’s role in global peace initiatives must strengthen the United Nations framework rather than promote “parallel arrangements that weaken international law and accountability”.
“Any initiative that claims to advance peace while excluding the very people under occupation contradicts the fundamental principles of justice and self-determination that PTI has always stood for,” the party said.
It also called into question the credibility of the Board of Peace, saying: “Palestinians remain excluded from the process while Israel continues to be included, even as violence persists in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.”
The opposition party stressed that “a peace mechanism without Palestinian representation can only be termed as control”.
The party strongly criticised PM Shehbaz for attending the inaugural meeting and for “making statements that compromise Pakistan’s dignity, independent foreign policy and historically principled stance on oppressed peoples”.
The government’s decision to join the board, first announced last month, was criticised by political parties, including the PTI, and analysts. The government had defended the move in Parliament, with PM Shehbaz later saying that Pakistan had joined after the federal cabinet gave the go-ahead.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201749155ed71b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974589/one-arrested-after-15-killed-in-building-collapse-triggered-by-gas-explosion-in-karachis-soldier-bazaar' target='_blank'><strong>One arrested after 15 killed in building collapse triggered by gas explosion in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Police on Friday arrested the builder in connection with the deaths of 15 people in a building collapse triggered by a gas explosion in Soldier Bazaar a day earlier.
Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Patel confirmed that the owner-cum-builder Mohammed Irshad had been arrested after the registration of a first information report (FIR). He said the held suspect had rented out the building to the victims.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Khalid Mehmood at the Soldier Bazar police station under sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 337-A (punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, police received information on early Thursday morning about the collapse of a building in Gul Rana Colony, in which several people were killed and injured.
Upon reaching the spot, the complainant said that one portion of the structure had completely collapsed. He said that the building, spread over 40 square yards, had been constructed using heavy-duty steel channels and nylon sheets. He further said that the building was a ground plus three-storey structure.
The sub-inspector said that a man named Shahid Rasool lived on the first floor with his family. He said that at around 3:30am, Rasool’s wife lit a match to prepare Sehr, adding that the room was already full of gas due to a leakage.
This led to the explosion, which caused the whole building to collapse, he said. The complainant further said that the rescue officials recovered at least 15 dead bodies from the rubble, while 15 others were injured in the incident.
The official stated that the owner of the building had constructed the structure “illegally” in approximately 2007/2008. He said that the gas connection was also provided “illegally through pipes installed in a haphazard and unsafe manner, leading to the unfortunate incident.
According to the FIR, the suspect committed negligence by installing substandard gas lines in an “illegally” constructed building.
The complainant further said that the Bomb Disposal Unit had examined the destroyed building and submitted their report. He said that according to the unit, the gas leakage occurred because of substandard gas pipelines, which led to a gas leak and ultimately triggered an explosion when a match was lit.</p><small>2026-02-20 13:11</small></div><hr>
