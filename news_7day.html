“Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House.
“And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received.
 






According to Politico, the other countries in that category includes Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added.
Sitting next to Trump, bin Salman promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But he offered no details or timetable.
Earlier, a  White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”.
The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought.
The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks.
The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift.
The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35.
The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership.
Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran.
But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 03:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691d18413a7dc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955954/crime-and-punishment' target='_blank'><strong>Crime and punishment</strong></a><br><p>THE trial and conviction of Sheikh Hasina Wajed must come as a lesson to all authoritarian rulers who see themselves as ‘god on earth’. The once all-powerful leader who governed Bangladesh with an iron fist for 15 long years — in the second stretch of her rule — and eliminated opposition with brute force, was driven out of power last year by a people’s movement. The disgraced leader who fled the country has now been convicted and sentenced to death for committing “crimes against humanity” though the sentence may never be implemented.
Such is the irony of history that the deposed leader was convicted by the same special tribunal which she had created to persecute her rivals. Some half a dozen political leaders, many of whom had served in previous administrations, were executed after dubious trials. Thousands of people were disappeared or thrown into dungeons for years. She retained power through controversial elections and had virtually established a one-party state.
But ultimately, the coercive power of the state could not withstand the power of the people. The ending was steeped in blood. A UN report said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the 2024 protests, most from gunfire by security forces; it cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers. But even such a display of repression could not save her from losing power.

Ultimately, the coercive power of the state could not withstand the power of the people.

She might have saved her life by fleeing the country but could not escape the criminal proceedings conducted in her absence. After months of being tried in absentia, a three-member International Crimes Tribunal pronounced her guilty on several charges including incitement, orders to kill and inaction to prevent atrocities as she oversaw a crackdown on anti-government protesters last year.
Announcing the verdict in a courtroom packed with the relatives of the victims, the tribunal said the “accused prime minister committed crimes against humanity by her order to use drones, helicopters and lethal weapons” against the people. Sheikh Hasina said that the tribunal was a “politically motivated charade”. Her former home minister has also been convicted.
The UN human rights office described the sentencing as “an important moment for victims” but said Sheikh Hasina should not have been sentenced to death. “We have been calling for perpetrators — including individuals in positions of command and leadership — to be held accountable in accordance with international standards,” said a UN spokesperson, adding: “We … regret the imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances.”
 
 

But Muhammad Yunus, the head of the provisional government of Bangladesh has defended the convictions saying it reaffirmed the principle that “no one, regardless of power, is above the law”. He called the verdict “vital, if insufficient, justice” to the thousands affected during the crackdown, including the families of those killed during the uprising.
This is the first time in Bangladesh that a former prime minister has been sentenced to death by the court though the country has seen some leaders meeting a violent end while in power. Among them was Sheikh Hasina’s father and Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was assassinated along with most of his family members on Aug 15, 1975, by a group of Bangladesh Army personnel who invaded his residence as part of a coup d’état. Sheikh Hasina escaped death as she was out of the country at that time. She lived in India for some years before returning to Bangladesh in the 1980s after being elected to head the Awami League. She was elected as prime minister for the first time in 1996 after the ouster of Gen Ershad’s government. But after the end of her first stint, she had to wait for almost a decade to return to power and then she stayed put for 15 long years.
One of the major reasons for her dictatorial control was the remarkable economic progress achieved by Bangladesh during that period. From a basket case, Bangladesh became an international success story with the fastest economic growth rate in South Asia. In the Human Development Index too, Bangladesh did very well as compared to other underdeveloped countries. This new prosperity and economic potential encouraged Sheikh Hasina to consolidate her authoritarian stranglehold, as she stocked state institutions with party loyalists.
But she failed to see the growing political unrest that was simmering beneath the surface. Her government crushed all voices of protest. Protests broke out in 2013 against the execution of some political leaders for alleged collaboration with the Pakistan military during the 1971 war. The protest was crushed with the full power of the state. The protest was a warning to her authoritarian rule but instead of heeding it, she consolidated more power and started building a personality cult around her father. Life-size portraits and sculptures of herself and Sheikh Mujibur Rehman adorned the capital’s streets and city squares.
The rigged elections of January 2024, when Sheikh Hasina won her fifth consecutive term in office, heightened political discontent in the country. The Awami League claimed a two-thirds majority in the elections, which had been boycotted by the opposition. Many of the remaining seats had also been won by ruling party members standing as independent candidates. The seething political discontent turned into a mass movement in July 2024 when students took to the streets to demand the removal of government job quotas for the descendants of those who participated in the 1971 independence movement. Soon, the movement brought down the government, with Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country.
The conviction and death sentence for the fugitive leader has once again brought Bangladesh into the spotlight. The tribunal’s judgement has heightened the prevailing tension in the country, which has not yet fully recovered from last year’s political upheaval. It is unlikely that India will extradite its trusted ally. Sheikh Hasina had virtually turned Bangladesh into a satellite state of India. Her ouster came as a huge geopolitical setback to New Delhi. The growing relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan under the new administration in Dhaka have added to the ire of the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi. Any Indian attempt to destabilise Bangladesh can have far-reaching geopolitical consequences.

At its meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on IT and Telecom directed the Pakistan Telecommu­nica­tion Authority (PTA) to conduct comprehensive nationwide surveys and take im­­­mediate practical steps to ensure fast and reliable internet services across the country.
Committee chairman Syed Amin ul Haq instructed the relevant officials to conduct special surveys through PTA teams to assess the quality of internet services being provided to the public, and to present a detailed report at the committee’s next meeting.
Briefing the committee, PTA officials said that 273 MHz spectrum was currently available in the country, but it was insufficient to meet the rising demand for high-speed internet. They added that the government plans to auction 600 MHz of spectrum across various bands, with the process now moving towards the rollout of 5G.

Telecom sector regulator ordered to conduct comprehensive surveys and present a detailed report

While reviewing progress of the Islamabad IT Park project, the committee was informed that the consultant’s contract had expired on Oct 31. The contractor has initiated the renewal process, which is expected to be finalised shortly.
The NA panel emphasised that the project must meet the timeline set by the prime minister — Dec 31, 2025.
Regarding the Karachi IT Park, the committee noted that the project remains in its initial stages and that the contract is expected to be awarded soon.
A delegation from South Korea is scheduled to visit on December 2 to finalise the remaining matters related to the contract award.
The committee directed officials to award the contract without further delay so that work can begin promptly, emphasising that the project must be completed within the stipulated two-year period.
The panel was also briefed by the managing director of the National Tele­com­munication Corporation (NTC) on the company’s future initiatives, including secure mobile connectivity for government officials and the establishment of new data centres in Karachi and Quetta.
The panel was told that these initiatives are part of a broader strategic plan aimed at enhancing cybersecurity and expanding reliable IT and telecom services for public sector institutions.
The committee appreciated NTC’s performance and acknowledged that the organisation’s ongoing projects were satisfactory. It advised NTC to refrain from downsizing and instead adopt a rightsizing approach to ensure no employee is laid off, and that staff members are appropriately adjusted and placed where their services are genuinely required.
The committee deferred the Preven­tion of Obscenity and Indecency in Digi­tal Media Bill, 2025, to the next meeting due to the absence of the bill’s mover.

Moreover, those countries — including Pakistan — that are considering contributing troops to the international stabilisation force that the Trumpian scheme envisages, must be clear on its mandate. While the UNSC has approved it, it is very much an American plan.
For example, the ISF will not act as a UN peacekeeping force; it will work in ‘consultation’ with Israel and Egypt. Moreover, the language about a path to Palestinian statehood is ambiguous. On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister has reaffirmed his commitment to blocking a Palestinian state. The framers of this resolution, and the supporters of this plan, must be asked how they expect to reconcile these divergent positions. China and Russia abstained while Pakistan supported the US resolution. Hamas, meanwhile, has been critical of the resolution, while questioning the ISF’s neutrality.
 
 

The resolution calls for the ISF to demilitarise Gaza, while the US ambassador to the UN has said the ISF will “support a region free from Hamas’ grip”. These statements clearly indicate that foreign troops will be deployed in Gaza to engage and disarm Hamas. Pakistan, and other Muslim states that are reportedly considering troops for the mission, must therefore be clear about what is expected of them. Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN has said that disarmament should be carried out “through a negotiated political process”, while also observing that further clarity was needed about all aspects of the plan.
Without this clarity, and without debate in parliament, Pakistan should not commit troops. We must not partake in an Israeli-American exercise to disarm Palestinian resistance movements and help perpetuate the occupation. However, if the stated purpose of the ISF is to facilitate Gaza’s reconstruction and rehabilitation, and most importantly, to protect Palestinians from Israel’s savage assaults, which continue despite the ‘ceasefire’, then the contribution of troops can be considered.
It would have been much better for the UN to have taken the lead in this peacekeeping mission, instead of simply endorsing the American plan. While it is hoped that Gaza’s long nightmare is over, and the Palestinians in general can restart their journey towards a sovereign state, we must not hold our breath. The main reason for pessimism is Israel’s lack of commitment to peace, and its historical disregard for Palestinian lives. We should know quite soon whether the effort is genuine, or the plan just endorsed by the UN is another smokescreen that will strengthen the occupation, this time with international sanction, and Arab and Muslim buy-in.

In an appeal moved under Article 185 of the Constitution, Salman Akram Raja, who is also PTI’s Secretary General, stated that the IHC while disposing of his contempt petition relied solely on oral assertion of the Adiala jail superintendent regarding alleged compliance with previous judicial directions.
The petitioner pleaded that the IHC failed to call for the relevant re­­cord to verify with the jail authorities about the implementation of ea­­r­­lier directions for making arran­g­e­ments for regular meetings with Imran Khan at the Adiala jail. This constitutes a miscarriage of justice and a failure to exercise constitutio­nal jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, the petition contended.
The petitioner argued that IHC failed to appreciate that its own previous judgment of March 24 had conferred a clear and unambiguous direction regarding visitation rights of the founding PTI chairman with his legal team and nominated coordinators, and that executive authorities were legally bound to comply with judicial orders unless modified or set aside by a superior forum.

IHC erred by disposing of case without looking at record, says Salman Akram Raja

The right of a prisoner to consult and communicate with his legal counsel is an integral part of Articles 4, 9, 10, and 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantee protection of law, liberty, fair trial, and due process, the petitioner stated, adding the high court while disposing of the matter on administrative grounds failed to safeguard these fundamental and inviolable rights.
The high court misapplied Rule 265 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978, without examining whether its rigid application is consistent with constitutional guarantees. These rules, being subordinate legislation, cannot override or restrict fundamental rights or judicial orders issued under Article 199 of the Constitution, the appeal argued.
Moreover, the high court also failed to appreciate that the administrative discretion of jail authorities is subject to judicial supervision, the petition argued, adding by directing strict adherence to the jail manual without enforcing previous judicial orders, the high court effectively allowed executive non-compliance to override judicial authority, contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers.
The petition contended that the high court erred in law as it dispo­s­­ed of the petition summarily, without examining the record of multip­le prior instances of non-compliance brought on the file, thereby failing to apply judicial mind and rendering the order mechanical, per­­functory, and devoid of reasoning.
Thus, the high court order resul­ted in a grave miscarriage of justice, as it deprived the petitioner and PTI founder of their rights to effective legal representation, consultation, and coordination in ongoing legal proceedings across the country.
The order also frustrates the principle of judicial supremacy, as it allows executive authorities to neutralize the effect of court orders through oral statements, the petitioner regretted.
The high court also failed to exercise its supervisory and coercive jurisdiction vested under Article 204 of the Constitution to ensure implementation of its previous orders and to hold the respondents accountable for continued defiance. Instead, it chose to dispose of the petition, and rendering the earlier judicial directions ineffective.
The Supreme Court has consistently held that when the high court declines to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law, or misinterprets the scope of its powers under Article 199, such refusal constitutes an error of law justifying the grant of leave to appeal, the petition maintained.

He said that Pakistan was home to numerous sacred religious sites for the Sikhs, where members of the Sikh community from all over the world came to perform their religious rituals and Pakistan ensured their hospitality.
The prime minister met President of Sikhs of America Jasdeep Singh who called on him, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was also attended by Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar and Pakistani-American businessman Sajid Tarar.
 
 

The prime minister said that it was a matter of pride that Pakistan was ensuring the maintenance of Sikh community’s sacred sites and Gurdwaras, as well as providing all possible facilities to them.
He said the government would provide more facilities to Sikh pilgrims from around the world.
 
 

While referring to the Pakistani diaspora, the prime minister said that they were playing a vital role in the country’s development, prosperity and bringing global recognition to Pakistan.
Jasdeep Singh thanked the prime minister and the government of Pakistan for their hospitality and the warm reception extended to Sikh pilgrims in Pakistan.

The PTI had held a protest outside the jail, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard.
In a post on social media platform X, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened.
It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”.
“What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said.
 






Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail.
 






Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said.
She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.”
Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”.
 






In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night.
“By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said.
 






It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”.
“The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added.
It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”.
“This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said.
‘Our collective humiliation’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet.
“The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return.
 






“This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi.
 






“With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir.
He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate.
“It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said.
 






“Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”.
“Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said.
 






PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters.
“We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.

Denial of due process and the sentence of death should give us pause. No matter what the offence, neither is to be celebrated.
The verdict has been handed down by the International Crimes Tribunal, a special domestic court set up by her with handpicked judges to sort out those she wanted punished. She succeeded, and several men were hanged on trumped-up charges in show trials.
Times change, and with them the crosshairs of kangaroo courts and the loyalties of those who man them. It is a lesson for all who confuse alliances with friendships and mistake servility for loyalty: by the time they learn, it is too late, both for them and the institutions they torpedo.
 
 

The accusation against Hasina was a deadly crackdown on the student protests of 2024; the charge was crimes against humanity.

The immunity of the few is made possible by the complicity of the many  and the indifference of all those who watch but say or do nothing

The episode put one in mind of the events of Friday, October 16, 1998. In a London clinic, an 82-year-old man was recuperating from a minor back operation. Around 11pm, there was a knock on the door. The man was woken up. He was informed of his rights. The order of his arrest was read out. International law turned a corner.
The man was General Augusto Pinochet. The coup he pulled had led to the death of Chile’s popularly elected President, Salvador Allende. For 17 years, he had ruled with an iron fist. Compelled to step down after a referendum unexpectedly went against him, he sought and got watertight immunity.
A belt was added to braces. He was made a senator for life and secured more immunity. Ever careful to make his immunities ironclad, when travelling to England, he became head of a diplomatic mission to negotiate an arms deal with the United Kingdom.
Accused of many crimes against humanity – including conspiracy to torture and assassination of critics and opponents – he took no chances. But what he underestimated was the growing reach of law, fearless investigators and independent judges. A chink in the armour was found. An extradition warrant was issued by a Spanish magistrate. International law was its basis. After a few ups and downs, the House of Lords (then the highest court of England) came through.
It was not an easy case. As Ariel Dorfman, author of The Pinochet Case: Origins, Progress and Implications, wrote in the New York Review of Books, no precedent existed to answer two important questions.
First, could a foreign court pass judgment against a former head of state of another country for crimes against humanity, committed in his own country and against his own people? Second, did his status as a former head of state and his presence in England on a diplomatic mission guarantee him immunity from prosecution anywhere in the world?
The court ruled that Britain and Spain had the right to put Pinochet on trial. Given the nature of his crimes, he had no immunity. He was to be extradited.
The real heroes of this triumph of international law were ordinary people who, against all odds, had refused to give up and had pursued justice for the disappeared and the dead.
In the end, politics prevailed. The governments of Spain, UK and Chile made a deal. The judiciary of Chile underwrote it by promising to try Pinochet, but it never did. Pinochet escaped trial, first in Spain, and later in Chile for faux health reasons.
Sheikh Hasina Wajid too, may yet be able to beat extradition.
But all has not been in vain. Cases against several others were reopened, and prosecutions commenced. Pinochet died in his bed, but till he did, he lived in fear.
Others, too, began to beware the reach of the law. In 1999, Franjo Tudman, of Croatia, fearing being indicted for crimes during the Yugoslavian conflict, decided not to go to Germany for treatment.
In 2002, Henry Kissinger, cancelled a trip to Brazil; in February, 2011 George W. Bush aborted a trip to Switzerland, suspecting that he may be questioned for authorising waterboarding; and in 2023, after being indicted by the ICC, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to South Africa.
While this may sound upbeat, one message from the authors of books on Pinochet’s murderous rule and his comeuppance is that the immunity of the few is made possible by the complicity of the many and the indifference of all those who watch but say or do nothing.
The other and more significant take is that absolute rulers, guilty of crimes against humanity, no longer have impunity from the long reach of the law. To use an oft-quoted expression, “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice”.

The draft includes a sweep of options on the most difficult issues, reflecting the gulf between the nearly 200 nations in Belem and the work still ahead to refine a final compromise.
The nine-page “Global Mutirao” document — a reference to an Indigenous concept of uniting toward a common goal — came after Brazil on Monday urged delegates to work day and night to produce an agreement by midweek.
 
 

The text leaves open a wide range of possibilities on the flashpoint issues in Belem — trade measures, finance for poorer nations, and the global inadequacy of carbon-cutting goals.
But the quick turnaround of a draft on these thorny points suggested the COP30 presidency was confident it could soon have an outcome, observers said.
“It represents a steady progression from the previous iteration and is likely one of the earliest releases of such a clean text in recent COP history,” said Li Shuo, a climate analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
 
 

The draft reflects the stark division between a coalition wanting a “roadmap” on a fossil fuel phase-out, and a bloc led by oil-producing countries opposing any such effort.
It proposes an optional “workshop” to discuss “low carbon solutions,” or a high-level ministerial roundtable on pathways to help countries “progressively overcome their dependency on fossil fuels.” A third option proposes no text at all.
The draft also raises the possibility of assessing national climate pledges annually, instead of every five years, to assess global progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions more frequently.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, President Trump also thanked China and Russia for not vetoing the US-drafted resolution, even though both abstained.
“Congratulations to the world on the incredible vote of the United Nations Security Council… ackno­wledging and endorsing the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by me,” he wrote, describing the move as “a moment of true historic proportion.”
 






The resolution, adopted on Monday evening in New York, lays out a multi-phase framework that includes establishing the Board of Peace and deploying an International Stabilization Force (ISF) to Gaza. The force is tasked with overseeing demilitarisation and supporting the transition toward an eventual independent Palestinian state.
President Trump also thanked states outside the Council that backed the initiative, naming Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye and Jordan. He said the full membership of the Board of Peace would be announced “in the coming weeks,” though he has already mentioned former British prime minister Tony Blair — who originally proposed the concept — as a possible member.
The Trump administration’s 20-point proposal, agreed with Israel and regional partners last month, envisions the Board of Peace steering post-war Gaza toward political stability, reconstruction and statehood. It also authorizes the ISF to use “all necessary measures” — UN language that permits the use of military force — to secure border areas, support vetted Palestinian police units, and ensure the flow of humanitarian assistance.
As the stabilisation force expands control and restores order, Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones and timeframes linked to demilitarization,” according to the resolution. These benchmarks must be jointly agreed by the ISF, Israel, the United States and the guarantors of the ceasefire.
Pakistan, which voted in favour of the resolution, urged the international community to ensure that the measures outlined in the plan translate into tangible progress toward Palestinian statehood.
Speaking at the Council, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the world must support a “credible and time-bound process” toward establishing a viable Pale­stinian state and insisted there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement.” He stressed that territorial contiguity between the West Bank and Gaza remained essential.
UN Secretary General António Guterres welcomed the Council’s decision, calling it “an important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire.” In a separate statement, he urged all parties to move “towards the second phase of the US plan,” which aims to launch a political process for achieving a two-state solution.
 






He said the United Nations was committed to fulfilling the responsibilities assigned to it under the resolution, including scaling up humanitarian operations to meet Gaza’s immense civilian needs.
Despite not blocking the measure, both Moscow and Beijing raised pointed objections.
Russia’s UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said “key components” related to legal questions had been overlooked and warned that the ISF seemed empowered to act “absolutely autonomously, without any regard for the position or opinion of Ramallah.” He argued the resolution evoked “colonial practices” reminiscent of the British Mandate period, where Palestinian views were sidelined.
China’s envoy, Fu Cong, said the text was “lacking in many respects and deeply worrisome.” He criticised the governance arrangements outlined for post-war Gaza, saying “Palestine is barely visible in it” and that Palestinian sovereignty and ownership were “not fully reflected.”
Although Israel hailed Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan after its endorsement by the UN Security Council, Hamas rejected the resolution because it fails to respect the “demands and rights” of the Palestinians.
“This resolution does not meet the level of our Palestinian people’s political and humanitarian demands and rights,” the group said in a statement.
The statement also decried the establishment of an international force whose “mission includes the disarmament” of Palestinian groups in Gaza.
“The resolution imposes an international trusteeship on the Gaza Strip, which our people, its forces, and its constituent groups reject,” the group said.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s office hailed Trump’s plan on Tuesday, saying it would lead to “peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarisation, disarmament and the deradicalisation of Gaza”.
On X, Netanyahu’s office said the plan would also lead to an expansion of the Abraham Accords.

“Solar generation is increasing, but this does not have a significant impact on the grid,” Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rehan Akhtar said while testifying before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Working under the Power Division, the CPPA is the key player responsible for the procurement of electricity from various sources and delivering to all distribution companies and handling their commercial affairs.
He said the energy costs had led to a shift to solar power. “They are now consuming more due to solar availability but their offtake from the national grid has not changed. Their withdrawal from the grid is almost stable. They are drawing the same quantities they were drawing earlier,” he said, adding, however, that the same could not be predicted about the future.

Net metering contribution jumped 173pc to 726m units in 2024

These comments came during the course of a public hearing on CPPA’s request for rebasing of power purchase price (PPP) with effect from January 2026 under the government’s policy directives.
The CPPA presented five different assumptions about the tariff revisions with effect from Jan 1, 2026. These assumptions presented a total average PPP price ranging between Rs25.95 per unit in the best case and Rs26.53 per unit in the worst case of currency devaluation to Rs300-310 from the existing Rs280-290 per dollar.
The existing PPP for FY26 stands at Rs25.98 per unit, showing a general sign of stability.
It was reported that net metering contribution had increased by 173pc to 726 million units in 2024 compared to 266m units in 2023, even though power distribution companies (Discos) showed 1pc growth. On the other hand, K-Electric offtake from the grid increased by 9.4pc as it started drawing the full 2,050MW.
 
 

Nepra was told that fuel costs were expected to remain generally stable with a minor risk of a 5pc increase in global prices in a worst-case scenario. Likewise, given foreign exchange reserve vulnerabilities, local currency had been estimated to increase by Rs10 in the first six months and Rs10 in the second half of the next calendar year in one case only. Interest rates were projected at 11pc for the first half and 10.5pc for the second half.
Industrial consumers bemoaned expensive energy costs, making their products uncompetitive. They said the industry was still cross-subsidising other consumers to the tune of Rs131bn, and all tariff reductions announced by the government had already vanished.
They said the CPPA’s calculation that demand will increase was inconsistent with ground realities, because consumption was going down because of high energy prices, the closing of industries and the shift to solar power.

Bunkering at a port is the process of supplying ships with fuel (such as marine gas oil, heavy fuel oil, or alternative fuels like LNG) for propulsion and onboard machinery.
It is a critical, tightly regulated operation that involves transferring fuel from land-based facilities, tanker trucks, or bunker vessels to the receiving ship’s fuel tanks.
Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday said the initiative was launched to accelerate the modernisation of port services and a broader upgrade of Pakistan’s maritime infrastructure.
He said the introduction of regulated bunkering would fill a long-standing gap in Karachi Port’s service offering, enabling it to compete more effectively with established bunkering hubs in the region and beyond.

Vitol begins refuelling ships with its barge at Karachi Port as Cnergyico starts supplying low-sulphur fuel

The minister said the availability of safe, reliable, and efficiently managed bunkering facilities is expected to attract more international shipping lines to Karachi, particularly those seeking streamlined port calls and predictable service standards.
Earlier, there was no refuelling facility for commercial shipping in the country, and ships had to obtain fuel from Fujairah or Singapore.
The fuel supply and bunkering facility will be executed by Vitol, a Swiss-based Dutch multinational energy and commodity trading company, through its barge.
Meanwhile, the Karachi-based Cnergyico refinery has started producing world-class ‘very low sulphur fuel oil’ (VLSFO) for ship refuelling.
The facility has also become essential as India has banned ships that enter or leave its ports from calling at any Pakistani port.
Sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) said that the availability of bunkering facilities would increase vessel traffic at the port, thereby improving revenue too.
Meanwhile, the maritime minister said that the move would translate into higher foreign-exchange earnings through port fees, marine services, and ancillary commercial activity such as repairs, supplies and maritime logistics.
Mr Chaudhry added that the new service would enhance Pakistan’s visibility in the international maritime market by demonstrating the country’s commitment to modern, environmentally responsible and globally competitive port management.
He said compliance with international standards covering fuel quality, safety procedures, documentation and transparency was essential for building confidence among ship-owners and global trading companies.
The minister said the first phase of operations would begin in collaboration with one of the world’s leading energy trading houses, which will conduct bunkering at Karachi Port in accordance with internationally certified practices.
He said the venture is expected to expand as domestic refineries supply larger quantities of refined fuel meeting global specifications, a development he described as a direct benefit to the national exchequer.
The minister noted that KPT had assessed existing bunkering practices, reviewed global procedures, drafted new documentation and engaged stakeholders to bring the service online.
He said the milestone reinforces KPT’s ambition to operate as a leading regional hub and signals the government’s intention to continue expanding port capabilities in line with international benchmarks.

“A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,” said an update from the CDN, whose network handles around a fifth of web traffic, posted at 7:42pm.
It later said that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. “We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues,” it added.
In a subsequent statement, Cloudfare said services were currently operating normally and it was no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.
“Our engineering teams continue to closely monitor the platform and perform a deeper investigation into the earlier disruption, but no configuration changes are being made at this time.
“At this point, it is considered safe to re-enable any Cloudflare services that were temporarily disabled during the incident. We will provide a final update once our investigation is complete,” it said.
“Earlier today, we failed our customers and the broader internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us,” chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on X, adding that the problem had since been resolved.
“In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made.” The company said earlier there had been “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of its services.
 






The incident marked the latest hit to major online services. An outage of Amazon’s cloud service last month caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.
Cloudflare — whose shares were down about five per cent in premarket trading — runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Earlier today, disruptions in internet access were widely reported as Cloudflare reported experiencing issues in its global network.
In an update on the situation posted at 6:09pm, it said: “We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London. We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.”
It later said it was continuing to work on restoring service for application services customers.
Earlier, the service provider said it was “aware of and investigating an issue” that was impacting multiple customers with widespread 500 errors, along with the Cloudflare dashboard and API application programming interface also failing.
NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, also said that a wide range of online services were experiencing disruptions due to a technical issue affecting Cloudflare’s global network. It added that the incident was not related to “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
 






Downdetector showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10 pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also down for thousands of users in the United States and worldwide, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
There were more than 11,500 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 6:41am ET, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
It was not immediately clear whether the outages were related.
X and Cloudflare did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said it was monitoring the global outage and was in contact with global platforms and local operators. It added that it would continue to observe the situation until services were fully restored.
Cloudflare had also reported a “widespread outage” in June 2022 and several popular websites were unreachable.
A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast.

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in August last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
Fazl is currently on a visit to the country and called for stron­ger ties, telling a large religious gathering that a shared “unity of faith was a stronger bond between the two nations that cannot be abolished”.
Addressing a gathering of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam members today at Dhaka’s Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre as the chief guest with several other Bengali political parties in attendance, Fazl said: “Pakistan wants Bangladesh’s prosperity and stability, has forgotten the bitter memories of the past.”
He reiterated that the people of Pakistan had “forgotten the old bitter memories”, adding that now “a new future has to be carved”.
The JUI-F chief added Pakistan saw Bangladesh as a “brother”. “We were one, and God willing, we will remain one. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be strengthened by the spirit of goodwill,” he added.
Fazl added that Islam is a religion of peace and security, but the United States is spreading chaos across the world. He maintained that internal divisions among Muslims give enemies an opportunity to attack.
“Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Pakistan has always worked for the protection of the rights of all people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, beyond sectarian and denominational lines.”
On the occasion, prominent political and social leaders from various political and religiopolitical parties were also present.
“Muslim Ummah cannot be divided, and no worldly power can break these bonds,” reiterated the JUI-F chief.</p><small>2025-11-18 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/182213556e3f69d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955843/fm-dar-meets-russias-putin-chinas-li-qiang-on-sidelines-of-sco-moscow-summit' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets Russia’s Putin, China’s Li Qiang on sidelines of SCO Moscow summit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday met with senior Russian and Chinese leadership at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of Government summit, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The SCO is holding its Council of Heads of Government summit in Moscow from November 17 to 18. Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order.
At the heads of government gathering, Dar met Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with other SCO heads of state and senior officials. In a post on X, the FO said that Putin welcomed leaders to the summit in the Russian capital.
He also “emphasised the importance of strengthening regional economic cooperation under the SCO, highlighting its role as a key platform for connectivity, stability, and mutually beneficial development across the region”.
 






Dar also met Chinese Premier Li Qiang, where the pair “reaffirmed the ‘all-weather’ Pakistan-China strategic partnership, reviewed bilateral and multilateral cooperation — especially within the SCO — and praised the Shanghai Spirit principles guiding regional collaboration”.
The post added that the FMs exchanged views on global issues and agreed to “maintain real-time engagement moving forward.”
 






Dar also had a bilateral meeting with Russian Deputy PM Alexei Overchuk on the sidelines of the summit, the FO said in another social media post.
“The two leaders undertook a substantive review of the full gamut of Pakistan–Russia relations, with a focus on strengthening cooperation across political, economic, energy, connectivity, agricultural, industrial, educational and people-to-people areas through institutionalised mechanisms,” the FO wrote.
“DPM Overchuk recalled his recent visits and noted Pakistan’s potential as a regional hub for transit and connectivity,” the post added. “Both leaders also exchanged views on key regional & global developments and reaffirmed their commitment to enhanced cooperation at bilateral and multilateral fora, including the UN and SCO.”
 






Additionally, Dar met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow summit, with photographs showing the pair hugging each other upon meeting.

During his address earlier today, Dar said the SCO was “well-placed” to promote regional cooperation in the humanitarian field to deal with emergencies.
“Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech in Moscow. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.”
 






He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal that “our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”.
The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space.
“Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region.
“Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said.
He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals.
This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”.
“An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.”
“Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said.
 






‘Youth empowerment of foremost importance’
Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy, and build human capital.
“While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said.
With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”.
“The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed.
 
 

“We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” the minister said.
He added that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect.
“Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.”
A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to Moscow.
 






Earlier this year, the SCO Council of Heads of State summit was held in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif raised the Indus Waters Treaty issue.
He also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date for it.

In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively.
It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian-sponsored” terrorists found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
“We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18182104907866e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955853/after-unsc-vote-on-gaza-plan-netanyahu-calls-for-hamass-expulsion-from-the-region' target='_blank'><strong>After UNSC vote on Gaza plan, Netanyahu calls for Hamas’s expulsion from the region</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday called for Hamas to be expelled from the region, a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) endorsed United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan that offers the Palestinian group amnesty.
Netanyahu publicly endorsed the plan during a White House visit in late September. However, his latest remarks appear to show that there are differences with the US on the path forward. Hamas has also objected to parts of the plan.
Diplomats say privately that entrenched positions on both the Israeli and Hamas sides have made it difficult to advance the plan, which lacks specific timelines or enforcement mechanisms. Still, it has received strong international backing, including from the Arab and Muslim countries that worked on it.
Netanyahu on Tuesday published a series of posts on X in response to the UN vote. In one post, he applauded Trump and in another wrote the Israeli government believes the plan would lead to peace and prosperity because it calls for the “full demilitarisation, disarmament, and deradicalisation of Gaza”.
 






“Israel extends its hand in peace and prosperity to all of our neighbours” and calls on neighbouring countries to “join us in expelling Hamas and its supporters from the region”, he said.
Asked what the prime minister had meant by expelling Hamas, a spokesperson said that it would mean “ensuring there is no Hamas in Gaza as outlined in the 20-point plan, and Hamas has no ability to govern the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip”.
 






Plan does not call for Hamas’s expulsion
Trump’s 20-point plan includes a clause saying that Hamas members “who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty”, and members who wish to leave will be given safe passage to third countries.
Another clause says Hamas will agree to not having any role in Gaza’s governance.
There is no clause that explicitly calls for the resistance group to disband or to leave Gaza.
The plan says reforms to the Palestinian Authority may ultimately allow conditions “for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
 
 

Ahead of the UN vote, Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to Palestinian statehood after protests by far-right coalition allies over a US-backed statement indicating support for a pathway to Palestinian independence.
Netanyahu also opposes any Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza.
European and Arab states have said that Gaza must be governed by the Palestinian Authority and that there must be a clear pathway to Palestinian independence.
First step towards peace: Palestinian Authority
The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, earlier welcomed the vote and has said it is ready to take part in Trump’s plan, which doesn’t outline a clear role for the authority.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin termed the UNSC resolution the “first step in a long road towards peace”.
“That step was needed because we could not embark on anything else before we had a ceasefire,” Shahin told reporters in Manila during a visit to the Philippines.
 


Shahin said there were still other issues that needed to be addressed, including Palestinian self-determination and eventual Palestinian independence, and that the process for implementing Trump’s plan must be governed by international law.
She said that although Trump’s plan alludes to possible Palestinian statehood only after the Palestinian Authority carries out reforms, that issue could be taken up later. “As long as these elements are in there, we’re happy with this first step,” Shahin said.
Multinational force for post-war Gaza
The UNSC resolution authorised a multinational force that Trump’s plan says will be temporarily deployed to Gaza to stabilise the territory.
The resolution’s text also says member states could join a “Board of Peace” that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery inside Gaza.
Hamas has criticised the resolution as failing to “live up to the demands and political and humanitarian rights” of the Palestinian people, who it said rejected an international guardianship mechanism of Gaza.
 
 

Any international force must only be deployed along Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and under UN supervision, Hamas said in a statement, warning that such a force would lose its neutrality if it tried to disarm the group.
Reham Owda, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza, said the Hamas statement should be viewed as an objection, rather than complete rejection, in an attempt to negotiate mechanisms for the international force and the role of the board of peace.
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10 as part of Trump’s multi-phased plan to end Israel’s two-year relentless bombardment.
Israel has partially withdrawn its forces but still controls 53 per cent of Gaza and the sides have accused each other of violations.
Abu Abdallah, a businessman displaced in central Gaza, said Palestinians would support the deployment of international forces if it meant that Israel would fully withdraw its forces.
“Hamas can’t decide our fate alone, but we also don’t want to get rid of one occupation, Israel, and get another international occupation,” he said by phone.
Water provider suspends services after Hamas detains staff member
Separately, a Gaza company that operates water desalination plants serving nearly half of the enclave’s population has stopped operations to protest the detention by Hamas of one of its staff.
Youssef Yassin, a board member of the Abdul Salam Yassin Company, said the move would affect more than 1 million people who normally receive water from the company.

Over 70 trucks that carry water containers across the enclave have also stopped operations, he added, risking further supply disruption after the pipeline network was badly damaged due to Israel’s bombing.
“I know it is catastrophic but protecting our employees is a sacred issue,” Yassin told Reuters.
Yassin said Hamas had given no reason for the arrest late on Monday. Hamas had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Hamas has been gradually reasserting control in areas of Gaza that Israel has withdrawn from as post-war talks over its future grind on. Foreign powers demand the group disarm and leave government but have yet to agree who will replace them.
Israel continues to control around half the Gaza Strip.
The move is a rare show of dissent against Hamas, which has run the Palestinian enclave since 2007.
 
 

Demonstrations briefly erupted in March and April, demanding an end to the war and that Hamas give up power, but fizzled out after a warning that public disorder would not be tolerated.
If the protest by the company persists, it could exacerbate the chronic water crisis in the enclave, which was worsened further by two years of Israel’s siege. Israel stopped all water and electricity supply to Gaza early in the offensive, resuming only a trickle of supplies later.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18200937e2eef30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955863/karachi-woman-given-8-years-by-us-court-for-lying-about-terrorist-acts' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi woman given 8 years by US court for lying about terrorist acts</strong></a><br><p>A woman in the Texas town of Frisco has been sentenced to eight years in prison for making false statements about alleged terrorist acts in Karachi, it emerged on Tuesday.
In a statement released by the US Justice Department last Friday, Acting US Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas Jay R Combs identified the woman as 34-year-old Kahkashan Haider Khan.
The Justice Department stated that Haider pleaded guilty to making false statements in relation to international terrorism and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison by US District Judge Amos L Mazzant III on October 7, 2025.
“We will not allow the United States to be a launching point for terrorist attacks abroad,” said Acting US Attorney Jay R Combs.
“Vigilantly protecting the United States and its interests is inherent in everything we do. This includes aggressively prosecuting those who wrongly believe that they can find safe harbour in the United States while plotting crimes elsewhere.”
FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R Joseph Rothrock said, “The FBI will aggressively investigate individuals planning or taking part in acts of violence in support of terrorism. We take these crimes seriously and will work with our international partners to hold perpetrators accountable.”
According to information presented in court, on February 23, 2023, Haider was interviewed by special agents from the FBI regarding her involvement in the planned fire-bombing of two gas stations in Karachi.
The Justice Department identified Haider, a US citizen and immigrant from Pakistan, as “a member of a separatist movement in Pakistan known as the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which claims grievances against the Pakistani government over the treatment of muhajir immigrants in Pakistan”.
The statement claimed that Haider “served as a recruiter and facilitator of terrorist actions in Pakistan by collecting funds, sending them to Pakistan, and arranging and paying for violent actions in Pakistan”.
The department reported that in January 2023, Haider recruited an individual in Pakistan to conduct fire-bombings on two Punjabi-owned gas stations in Karachi, Pakistan.
Haider discussed multiple aspects of the plan with her co-conspirator in Pakistan, including selecting the target locations, discussing which flammable accelerants to use, where to stage before the attacks, how to escape after the attacks, and arranging for the purchase of two firearms to be used by the attackers to ensure their success, the statement added.
The department claimed that Haider collected money from MQM sympathisers in the United States and wired the funds to Pakistan to pay for the attacks.
The details show that on February 20, 2023, Haider’s co-conspirator in Pakistan sent her photos from news coverage of a fire-bombing of a Karachi gas station caused by attackers throwing something from a vehicle, resulting in six people being burned.
Haider “celebrated the news and told her Pakistani co-conspirator that he would be greatly rewarded for his work. Throughout that day, February 20, 2023, Haider scoured the internet for news in Pakistan regarding the fire-bombing but could find none.”
After approximately one day of searching, she discovered that the photos her co-conspirator sent were from an event that occurred in October 2022. Haider “was furious and accused her co-conspirator of deceit and being a disgrace to the MQM movement”, the Justice Department noted.
On February 23, 2024, FBI special agents interviewed Haider at her home about these events. During the interview, she made multiple false statements about the events and lied about her involvement in the attempted attacks.
Haider denied that she wanted a co-conspirator to commit the fire-bombings in Pakistan. She denied that she was involved in an action in Pakistan that would possibly result in someone’s harm or death.
During her plea hearing in February 2025, she admitted that these were false statements made knowing that the statements were material to a terrorism investigation.</p><small>2025-11-18 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/182032559a511eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955861/pti-leader-shah-mahmood-qureshi-undergoes-successful-gallbladder-surgery-lawyer-says' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi undergoes successful gallbladder surgery, lawyer says</strong></a><br><p>Senior PTI leader and ex-foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi underwent a successful procedure to remove his gallbladder, lawyer Rana Mudassar Umer said on Tuesday.
The senior PTI leader, incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail since 2023, was hospitalised at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications on October 31, his daughter Meher Bano said. She added that his condition deteriorated while imprisoned and that surgery was “unavoidable”.
Speaking to Dawn, Umer said Qureshi’s gallbladder was successfully removed during the procedure.
“Shah Mehmood Qureshi will remain under the constant supervision of doctors for a few days,” he stated. “Shah Mehmood Qureshi has appealed to the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.”
Meher Bano also spoke to Dawn about the procedure, saying that the procedure was successful and the PTI leader is currently under observation.
“The size of the stone inside the gallbladder was quite large, so the surgery took longer than usual,” she explained. “[The doctor] performed the surgery successfully in the best possible manner.”
Meher Bano added that Qureshi’s recovery will “take some time”, expressing gratitude to people for their prayers.
Meanwhile, PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser, in a post on X, prayed for Qureshi’s speedy recovery.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi sahib has been enduring innocent imprisonment for the past two years due to his loyalty and steadfastness to Imran Khan’s vision,” he wrote. “The courage, patience, resolve, and spirit with which he has borne this trial set an exemplary standard within him. I salute his steadfastness.”
 






After Qureshi was hospitalised, three former PTI leaders arrived in his hospital room at the start of November to convince him to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by the ex-FM.
According to Umer, former leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood managed to gain access to Qureshi when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-18 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181900090748f2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955860/what-are-the-pitfalls-for-uks-asylum-system-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>What are the pitfalls for UK’s asylum system overhaul</strong></a><br><p>The UK government has unveiled unprecedented changes to its asylum system in a bid to deter irregular migration and make deportations easier.
How long will it take to implement the measures? Will there be any obstacles, and could the proposals be effective in discouraging small boat crossings, which successive governments have failed to curb?
What is the timeline?
The policy paper titled “Restoring Order and Control” was announced on Monday by interior minister Shabana Mahmood, who told lawmakers the reforms would discourage migrants from crossing the Channel from France on small boats.
Many of the changes will need to be introduced as new legislation and be approved by parliament, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party holds a significant majority.
The interior ministry has said it will end its legal obligation to provide support to asylum seekers “in the coming months”.
Other changes —  including increasing the time refugees must wait before applying for permanent residency from five to 20 years — will be subject to a public consultation before the legislation applying them is drafted, meaning they could take longer to implement.
A consultation will also be launched on plans to deport families, including children, who are refused asylum.
“For a lot of these important details, the government has said they will consult in the future, or they will announce next year exactly what’s going to happen,” Mihnea Cuibus, researcher at the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory, told AFP.
“Some things are still very much in the air,” said Cuibus.
What hurdles could it face?
One of the most contentious proposals — modelled on Denmark’s strict asylum system — is making refugee status temporary.
Refugees will have their status reviewed every 30 months and be forced to leave if their home country is deemed “safe”.
Critics have said this could be costly and slow down the interior ministry, known as the Home Office, which is already struggling to process a backlog of asylum applications and appeals.
The government will also have to balance its stricter policies with constitutional safeguards.
It has said it will introduce other legal pathways for asylum seekers, including for vulnerable groups like unaccompanied children and families with children.
But it will face questions about plans to deport families and children who are deemed ineligible for asylum or, once their home countries are considered safe, as well as moves to end automatic family reunions.
There are also concerns that concerns that ending guaranteed benefits for asylum seekers could clash with core legal obligations to support children in need. Cuibus said it was still “early” to understand how vulnerable groups will be affected.
“Oftentimes, even in policies that are quite strict, we do tend to see potential exemptions for vulnerable groups.” Policies could face legal challenges, and they will be debated in parliament, where some left-wing Labour MPs and the leftist Greens have expressed discontent.
But the centre-right Conservative opposition indicated it could back the proposals, while the head of policy of the hard-right Reform UK party said “rhetorically, we would agree with a lot of what the home secretary said.”
Will it be effective?
Charities have warned that the policy revamp will not deter people, many fleeing conflict, from making the crossings, with rising numbers risking the perilous journey.
The government insists it will make the UK less desirable for migrants, and policies like allowing asylum claimants only one appeal will fast-track deportations of those whose claims are rejected.
It will also legislate to require courts to only consider “immediate family” when deportations are challenged under the right to family life.
However, commentators point out that this is already largely the case.
The interior ministry threatened to stop granting visas to nationals from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless they accepted the return of “their criminals and illegal immigrants”.
“The imposition of visa penalties on one country will send a message to all,” the policy paper states.
According to analysis by the PA news agency, only 14 nationals from the targeted countries entered the UK illegally in the year to June 2025 — around 0.02 per cent of the total number of irregular migrants who arrived.</p><small>2025-11-18 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18183230c841ff6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955859/explainer-why-did-a-cloudflare-outage-cause-websites-to-go-down' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: Why did a Cloudflare outage cause websites to go down?</strong></a><br><p>Disruptions in internet access were widely reported on Tuesday as Cloudflare, a content delivery network and domain name server (DNS) service, reported it was experiencing issues in its global network.
Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources, showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services, and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also experiencing outages, with more than 5,600 reports of issues with the social media platform, as of 06:51am Eastern Time (4:51pm PKT), according to Downdetector.
Cloudflare said it was “aware of and investigating an issue which impacts multiple customers”, but how did their service going down cause outages on multiple platforms?
What is a DNS service provider?
A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast.
All websites rely on DNS service providers like Amazon Web Services, GoDaddy and Cloudflare to function so that users can find and connect to the site’s server. This applies to online businesses, news outlets and social media platforms, among others.
When the provider experiences an outage, like Cloudflare did today, websites using that service will become inaccessible, as users cannot connect to the site’s server.
What causes these outages?
Websites and other services going down can be attributed to a DNS outage, which the BBC reported was the root cause of a major outage of Amazon Web Services last month, which rendered over 1,000 websites and services inaccessible.
DNS hosting service ClouDNS says on its website that a DNS outage is “a period of time when the domain name can’t be resolved to its IP address”. It adds that these can be caused by poor configuration or issues in data centres, maintenance of the authoritative server or even cyberattacks.
What are the consequences?
ClouDNS says that outages of this nature “could have a negative impact on your entire organisation and community of customers”.
“When DNS is down, websites, applications, and online services related to the domain name, such as emails, won’t function correctly,” the service says. “Unfortunately, that has the potential to damage operations, revenue, and brand reputation.”
ClouDNS listed a lack of potential visitors to websites, loss of revenue from potential sales, productivity losses and an impact on customers and partners as some of the issues that arise from a DNS service going down.</p><small>2025-11-18 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18143738303f343.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955826/ppps-faisal-rathore-sworn-in-as-new-ajk-prime-minister' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Faisal Rathore sworn in as new AJK prime minister</strong></a><br><p>Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore on Tuesday was sworn in as the 16th prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.
Speaking after the oath, Rathore said, “First of all, I thank God from my heart for bestowing this heavy responsibility on my weak shoulders.”
The newly sworn-in premier said fulfilling those duties would not be an “easy task in this extremely difficult era”, but said he believed God gave strength to those entrusted with such tasks.
 


Rathore also thanked President Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur, saying that owing to them, not only was a “new government established, but the PPP has again become one of the biggest parties” in AJK.
The PPP leader termed AJK a “basecamp” of the freedom movement for Kashmir. “It aims to cultivate this movement and fully play its role in it while staying here,” he said.
The new premier highlighted that another key point was the region’s development and progress. He paid tribute to the martyrs of the freedom movement and the soldiers on the Line of Control.
 
 

Rathore also recalled that in 1975, ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had chosen his father late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore as a senior minister, and later in 1990, ex-PM Benazir Bhutto chose him as the AJK premier “despite him being a part of a small community in the PPP”.
“And now, in 2025, the party leadership trusted me and sent me into this field,” Rathore added. He went on to affirm that this “relationship of trust based on half a decade” would remain between him and his party.
‘Six months are a test’
PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also spoke on the occasion, urging the people to work together with his party. He also called for the restoration of open courts in the region.
Pointing out that elections were due in AJK in six months, he asked the PPP’s head in the region, Chaudhry Yasin, to start preparing for the polls.
He further assured that the PPP would not run the government from “closed rooms”.
“We will sit among the public, meet them, join their political struggle, and resolve their problems.”
He further stated: “These six months are a test. After this test, we will […] again get the people’s mandate and again lead this government. And we will show the world that when we work together […] when we don’t fight among ourselves, how my Kashmir progresses on the global stage.”
 


The PPP chairman then went on to call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “coward”, saying that he had been “hiding his face from the world” following the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May. Meanwhile, Bilawal said, Pakistan’s diplomatic standing had improved.
He also slammed Modi over a “conspiracy to undermine the relationship between Pakistan and the people of Azad Kashmir”.
“I want to tell Modi that you lost the war, and God willing, this conspiracy of yours will also be unsuccessful. No one can undermine the relationship between the PPP and the public of Azad Kashmir,” Bilawal added.
Prosperity of AJK’s people among Centre’s priorities: Shehbaz
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly elected Rathore that the prosperity and progress of the region were among the federal government’s top priorities.

In a phone call, PM Shehbaz conveyed his heartfelt congratulations to Rathore on being chosen as the new premier of AJK, state-run PTV News reported.
“The progress and prosperity of AJK’s people are among the federal government’s priorities,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.
He further assured Rathore that the Centre was determined to work with the AJK government for the “welfare, economic development, prosperity, and peace and security” of the region’s public.
PM Shehbaz pledged that the federal government will provide “every possible cooperation” to the AJK set-up. He also expressed his best wishes to the PM-elect for his tenure.
 






Rathore is AJK’s fourth premier in the last four years, and the 16th since 1975 when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The no-confidence vote against Chaudhry had sailed through on Monday with 36 votes from PPP and PML-N members, while two PTI opposition members voted against it.
Under the AJK Constitution, a note of no-confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
After his election yesterday, the 47-year-old PM-elect announced several administrative measures, including a downsizing process, a new transport policy for officials, and limiting the number of secretaries to 20. He also pledged to address public issues and cater to the needs of low-paid staff.</p><small>2025-11-18 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1817211523b48ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955852/sarajevo-siege-survivors-hope-for-justice-as-italy-probes-alleged-sniper-tourism' target='_blank'><strong>Sarajevo siege survivors hope for justice as Italy probes alleged ‘sniper tourism’</strong></a><br><p>The launch of an investigation in Italy into allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo three decades ago has raised survivors’ hopes that people will be brought to justice.
About 11,000 civilians were killed by shelling and sniper fire from Bosnian Serb army positions on hills around the besieged city during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia.
Milan prosecutors opened their investigation, a source said, after local journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni filed a legal complaint over allegations that Italians and other foreigners had paid members of the Bosnian Serb forces to visit and shoot at civilians under what some referred to as “sniper tourism”.
Gavazzeni said he had been inspired to look into the allegations after watching a 2022 documentary titled Sarajevo Safari, by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic.
Without providing any firm evidence, Gavazzeni said wealthy foreigners paid large sums of money to take part in the shooting trips. He said the Italians used to meet in the city of Trieste before travelling to Belgrade, where Bosnian Serb soldiers escorted them to the hills overlooking Sarajevo.
Old wounds reopened
Opening an investigation is a formality in Italy when such a legal complaint is filed, and no individual suspects have been named. But some Sarajevo residents welcomed the investigation even though it reopened old wounds.
“I am completely shocked,” said Muamer Kalic, a Sarajevo University professor who spent the war in Sarajevo. “These are planetary disasters, and those who admired or financed that should, at the very least, face hanging or life imprisonment.”
Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were jailed for life for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but many Sarajevo residents want others brought to justice.
 
 

Former Sarajevo Mayor Benjamina Karic said she hoped news of the Milan prosecutors’ investigation would pave the way for Bosnian state prosecutors to open an investigation into former Bosnian Serb army commanders and individuals over the siege.
“As a child who grew up and survived the siege of Sarajevo…I have special emotions about this case and truly want to believe the investigation will be initiated,” said Karic.
In a statement to Reuters, the Bosnian state prosecutor’s office said it had not been contacted by the Milan prosecutors.
The Milan prosecutors have not commented on the case.
Edin Subasic, a retired Bosnian army intelligence officer who featured in Zupanic’s documentary, said he learnt of the allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians in 1993 from the testimony of a captured Bosnian Serb army soldier.
“It attracted our attention because it was extraordinary to have civilians with hunting rifles and highly sophisticated equipment on the battlefield,” Subasic told Reuters.
Subasic said Bosnian army intelligence had forwarded the allegations at the time to an Italian military intelligence agency.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181414008ef7d85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955840/economic-coordination-committee-approves-grants-for-security-defence-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Economic Coordination Committee approves grants for security, defence projects</strong></a><br><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Tuesday approved grants pertaining to Pakistan’s security and defence.
In a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a meeting of the ECC that was attended by federal ministers, special assistants to the prime minister, secretaries, and senior officials from relevant divisions.
It said the ECC approved “several strategic grants and reforms aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s security framework, defence capabilities, food security, and petroleum sector operations”.
 






According to the ministry’s statement, a technical supplementary grant of Rs100.3 million was approved for the maintenance of defence equipment used by the federal civil armed forces.
A technical supplementary grant of Rs841.56m was also approved for enhanced border management, internal security and law and order. Further, a technical supplementary grant of Rs50 billion was also approved for defence services projects.
The ECC also decided to establish a new special purpose vehicle, with initial paid-up capital of Rs1,000,000, to take forward the winding up of Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation, along with “measures to incentivise foreign participation in offshore oil and gas exploration, including licence extensions and working interest assignments”.
ECC greenlights offshore exploration consortium
Pakistan also approved a new offshore exploration consortium, clearing Turkish Petroleum Overseas Company (TPOC) to take over operatorship of the Eastern Offshore Block-C as part of a push to revive drilling, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said.
The ECC approved Pakistan Petroleum Limited’s request to assign part of its interest in the block to TPOC, Mari Energies and state-run Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd, leaving PPL with a 35 per cent stake.
TPOC will hold 25pc and will operate the block once a formal agreement is signed.
“This will bring valuable international offshore operating experience to Pakistan’s exploration landscape and this transition is expected to enhance technical capabilities, operational efficiency, and overall project delivery,” Schehzad wrote on X.
He said the block contains a drill-ready prospect that the consortium will now pursue, a step he added could attract fresh foreign investment.
“With the ECC’s approval, the consortium is now set to advance preparations for drilling operations, marking a new chapter in the country’s pursuit of energy security and resource development,” he said.
 






In October, bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres, in the first offshore bidding round since 2007.
Pakistan’s 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since independence in 1947; too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential.
Finmin meets delegation representing group founded by tech entrepreneurs
Separately, Finance Minister Aurangzeb held a meeting with a high-level delegation representing Dialog, an invite-only network founded by tech entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman.
In a handout, the ministry said the delegation was led by Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui and also included UK House of Lords Member Simon Stevens, Austrian MP Veit Valentin Dengler, Norwegian MP Himanshu Gulati, Jigsaw Chief Executive Officer Yasmin Green, Xbox-Microsoft Vice President Fatima Kardar and others.
The ministry said that during the meeting, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s economic reforms.
 






He also stressed the government’s focus on tax reform, energy sector restructuring, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, governance reforms, and rationalisation of federal expenditures.
“He emphasised efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base by integrating technology and artificial intelligence-based monitoring, enhancing compliance, and bringing under-taxed sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale/retail into the tax net,” the press release said.
The minister also discussed ongoing pension reforms, including the shift to contributory schemes for new entrants and upcoming measures to tackle long-term fiscal liabilities.
Aurangzeb outlined governance improvements in electricity distribution companies, loss-reduction initiatives, private-sector representation on boards, and a renewed privatisation pipeline.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a competitive tariff regime, long-term sustainability, and greater private-sector participation,” the handout said.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18143344dbc25b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955841/babar-azam-fined-for-icc-code-of-conduct-breach-during-third-odi-against-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Babar Azam fined for ICC Code of Conduct breach during third ODI against Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s star batter Babar Azam was fined for a minor ICC Code of Conduct breach during the third One-Day International (ODI) against Sri Lanka on Sunday, according to the International Cricket Council.
A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan and a laboured chase later saw the hosts beat Sri Lanka by six wickets to complete a 3-0 series sweep over the visitors in the third and final ODI at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Babar was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for a Level 1 ICC Code of Conduct breach, which carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50pc of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.

“The 31-year-old has been found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to ‘abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match’,” ICC said in a press release.
One demerit point has been added to his disciplinary record, making it his first  in a 24-month period.
The incident occurred in the 21st over of Pakistan’s innings when Babar hit the stumps with his bat before leaving the crease following his dismissal (34 off 52) by Sri Lanka’s Jeffery Vandersay.
According to ICC,on-field umpires Alex Wharf and Rashid Riaz, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid and fourth umpire Faisal Afridi levelled the charge while Ali Naqvi of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees proposed the sanction.

The legislation, which has brought major structural changes to the judiciary and the military, has been assailed by the legal fraternity, even former and sitting judges, as an “attack” on judicial independence.
In a meeting on Friday, the TTAP had vowed to vigorously protest to “restore the Constitution to its original form”.
Under a plan announced then, members of parties under the TTAP umbrella gathered outside Parliament House today to hold a protest. They then marched to the Supreme Court on Constitution Avenue.
TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI Senator Faisal Javed were at the forefront of the march, visuals shared by the TTAP on social media platform X showed.
“Battle will persist till the judiciary’s independence,” they chanted. TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai could be seen participating in the march as well.
 






At the protest outside Parliament House, visuals shared by the TTAP showed protesters holding banners that read “Death to dictatorship, long live democracy”, “27th Amendment rejected”, and “Subjugation of the judiciary is the public’s subjugation”.
Achakzai, Abbas, Raja, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser were among the key leaders present at the protest. Others included PTI MNAs Zain Qureshi and Junaid Akbar, Balochistan National Party-Mengal’s (BNP-M) Sajid Tareen, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry.
 






The gathered protesters chanted, “Aise dastoor ko nahi maantey, subh-i-be-nur ko nahi maantey” (we do not accept this constitution, we do not accept this morning bereft of light) — echoing Habib Jalib’s poetry, also used by opposition lawmakers in recent parliamentary sessions.
The TTAP leaders also raised slogans in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan, with some holding party flags.
 






National moot planned; ‘Black Day’ on Friday
Addressing the media, Achakzai announced that TTAP will organise a national conference on the 27th Amendment, where judges, lawyers, journalists, experts, and others will be invited.
The TTAP chief, as decided in the group’s Friday meeting, also announced that a “Black Day” will be observed on Friday (November 21) across the country in protest of the 27th Amendment.
He reiterated the TTAP’s objection to the lifetime immunities granted to the army chief and the president through the 27th Amendment, stressing that every person shall be held accountable for their actions under Islam.
Achakzai further said that even if a political party held a “100 per cent mandate” in the parliament, it could not change the “basic structure” of the Constitution of civilian supremacy. “The military, the judiciary, everyone will be independent in their functions, but they must be subservient to the elected parliament,” he asserted.
 






Speaking to reporters, Qaiser said the TTAP leadership, civil society, lawyers, mediapersons and other stakeholders will gather next week to formulate the future action plan.
In a post on X, Qaiser said protesters criticised the government for “disfiguring the unanimous Constitution of 1973 through force and horse-trading”. “We do not accept any 26th or 27th Amendment passed through the back as they fundamentally aim to bring the judiciary under the executive,” he added.
 






At the protest, Raja stressed that PTI lawmakers were the “representatives of the Pakistani public” and they rejected the new amendments, saying they were an “attack on the judiciary and the people”. “Your [and] my life, property, chaddor (honour), privacy — all has been taken away,” he claimed.
Yesterday, PTI MPAs held a walk from the Punjab Assembly to Charing Cross on The Mall to record their protest against the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Last week, the TTAP also said a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th Amendment.
The TTAP, formed in April last year, is a coalition of six opposition parties, including the PTI. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.</p><small>2025-11-18 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1814583202c41d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955838/3-key-judicial-bodies-reconstituted-in-light-of-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>3 key judicial bodies reconstituted in light of 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>As the dust settles after the passage of the 27th Amendment Constitutional Amendment, changes have been made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, Supreme Court’s  Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has been included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while Federal Constitutional Court’s (FCC)  Justice Aamer Farooq has been made a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
Changes in their composition were required to synchronise them with the latest constitutional amendment.
A Supreme Court (SC) press release issued on Tuesday said: “Pursuant to the 27th Constitutional Amendment, [these] key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies […] have been reconstituted in accordance with the revised constitutional framework.”
Elaborating on the changes in the bodies’ composition, the press release said that Justice Mandokahail, being the second-most senior judge of the SC, had been jointly nominated by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan as a member of the SJC.
Now, apart from Justice Mandokhail, the SJC will comprise the CJP, FCC CJ Aminuddin, Justice Munib Akhtar of the SC, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi of the FCC, Lahore High Court (LHC) CJ Aalia Neelum and Islamabad High Court (IHC) CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
According to the 27th Amendment, the SJC will be headed by the senior most judge between the CJP and FCC chief justice. The inter-se seniority in this case will be determined by the dates of their appointment as the chief justices of the SC and FCC. This means that CJP Yahya will continue to head the body.
The SC press release also added that the two judges had nominated Justice Mandokhail as a member of Practice and Procedure Committee.
Under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Act 2023, the three-judge committee will now comprise the CJP, Justice Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail, who has become the second-most senior judge following the resignation of Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
According to the SC press release, Justice Farooq, the second most senior judge of the FCC, was jointly nominated by the chief justices of the SC and FCC as a member of the JCP.
Following this, the JCP will now comprise the CJP, FCC chief justice, Justice Akhtar, FCC’s Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members from the National Assembly, two members from the Senate and a woman or non-Muslim nominated by the National Assembly speaker.
“The reconstituted bodies will continue to play a central role in matters of accountability, judicial appointments, and procedural governance under the amended constitutional scheme,” the press release read.
The changes in the bodies’ composition come amid a restructuring of the judiciary following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the FCC, was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry. It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethroning the SS as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Hours after the Amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC had resigned, citing their reservations against it. These two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
ICJ’s reservations
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has also expressed concern over several main points of the Amendment, namely the formation of the FCC, the appointment of judges and chief justices to the SC and the FCC, the composition of the JCP, the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the (ICJ) statement issued on Nov 13 read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-18 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18114728d926e01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955828/terrorist-killed-in-failed-attempt-to-blow-up-bridge-in-bannu-after-ied-detonates-prematurely' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist killed in failed attempt to blow up bridge in Bannu after IED detonates prematurely</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists’ bid to blow up a bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district failed on Tuesday when an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated prematurely while it was being installed, police said.
Amir Khan, the spokesperson for the District Police Office in Bannu, told Dawn that two terrorists intended to blow up Doghoda Bridge. He said that one of them died on the spot when the IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.
The other terrorist was injured and escaped the scene, he added.
The spokesperson said police had reached the spot and were collecting evidence. Meanwhile, the process for the identification of the dead terrorist had also been initiated, he said.
A search operation was also under way to track down the other terrorist, he added.
Today’s incident comes around a month after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Bannu.
According to police, terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance in the October 19 incident.
But, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement, preventing the terrorists from coming near the police station. Eventually, the terrorists fled, a police statement said.
In a similar incident on October 17, three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Bannu late at night.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1811041743e27aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955824/vitol-cnergyico-make-pakistans-biggest-single-delivery-of-marine-fuel' target='_blank'><strong>Vitol, Cnergyico make Pakistan’s biggest single delivery of marine fuel</strong></a><br><p>Vitol and Cnergyico, Pakistan’s largest oil refiner, have delivered the country’s biggest single shipment of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for ship refuelling, the global trading firm said in a statement late Monday.
The move will enable large vessels refuelling in Pakistan to now sail longer routes from east to west without needing to stop elsewhere, while also giving the country a stronger local supply of environmentally compliant marine fuel.
This shipment came from Cnergyico’s first large-scale batch of fuel that meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) low-sulphur rules. The company began producing it after importing its first US crude oil cargoes earlier this year.
Vitol delivered the VLSFO to a vessel owned and operated by shipping major MSC at Port Qasim, using a Singapore-flagged bunker barge Marine Ista that has the capacity to supply 6,800 metric tons of marine fuel in a single delivery.
It was also the first barge to load fuel directly from the Karachi Port Trust’s Oil Pier rather than through truck deliveries.
Cnergyico will continue providing Vitol with this cleaner marine fuel, according to Vitol.
“This latest initiative enhances Pakistan’s capacity to serve the global shipping industry with sustainable fuel solutions,” said Aumar Abbassciy, director at Cnergyico Pk Limited.
Vitol’s new bunker locations in Pakistan will include Karachi Port, Port Qasim, and Karachi Anchorage, according to Vitol’s bunker trading and marketing manager Ammar Hussaini.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691939b7e4c5c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955416/non-fiction-mothers-and-daughters' target='_blank'><strong>NON-FICTION: MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS</strong></a><br><p>


 
Mother Mary Comes to Me
By Arundhati Roy
Scribner Books
ISBN: 978-1668094716
352pp.
Our relationship with our mother is complicated; I dare say more than it is with our father. That is because, all over the world, the mother’s role is venerated as the provider of nurture and unconditional love. Anything that veers from that is vilified — think Mommie Dearest, the memoir, then movie, about Joan Crawford’s alleged abuse of her adopted daughter. That phrase conjures up the worst images about motherhood.
This notion of mothers and motherhood being perfect also explains why there is still a lot of taboo around postpartum depression. To admit you’re feeling anything other than perfect following childbirth brings about feelings of shame because society places a lot of unrealistic pressures on women.
Sure, things are changing and there are so many resources to help women with pregnancy, postpartum and parenting, but it takes a rare kind of no-holds-barred honesty to describe motherhood and/or mothers as complex, not perfect, maybe not even nice. I believe Arundhati Roy has done so with great aplomb in her memoir Mother Mary Comes to Me. 
Look, all our mothers have some level of mean streak in them — they’re graduates in the chittar school of parenting or possessing that silent look that struck fear in your heart. But Roy’s mother, Mary Roy, was a whole different ball game.

Celebrated author and activist Arundhati Roy attempts to come to grips with her complex relationship with her mother after her passing — as well as the ways her mother shaped who she became

On the one hand she was a fierce feminist; a remarkable woman who took on injustice, such as Syrian Christian women’s inheritance rights. She won a landmark 1986 case in the Indian Supreme Court that struck down a discriminatory law as unconstitutional. She built a modest school in Kerala that grew to a successful one and was a role model for so many students and graduates. But she was also cruel to her children: her son LKC, who she once called ugly, and daughter Arundhati, with whom she butted heads. 
Yet she also loved them.

Arundhati was “heart-smashed” when her mother died in 2022 and began writing this memoir in a way to explore her relationship. We learn that, despite the flaws, her mother helped shaped the writer and activist that Arundhati is today. Mary Roy was, as the kids would say, the ‘OG’ (‘Original Gangster’ or pioneer) challenger of societal expectations.
She married to escape an abusive father, then left her alcoholic husband to raise her children by herself and then started a progressive school in Kerala and challenged all sorts of norms expected of women. When evicted out of her house by her family because the law was on their side, she waited and took on that discriminatory law to win rights for all women. She was a celebrity in her own right.
But, as Roy writes, “My mother unloaded the burden of her quarrels and the daily dose of indignity that she had to endure on to my brother and me.” While you cringe at some of the shocking ways she parented and punished her children, you can’t help but empathise with Mary Roy, both an inspiration and a person to fear. 
As an aside, Arundhati’s description of her childhood near the Meenachil River in Kerala will feel eerily similar to her first novel, The God of Small Things, as will the characters of the twins. I thought the character Chako was based on Roy’s uncle G. Isaac. Art imitates life. 
Arundhati left home at 18, “not because I didn’t love her, but in order to be able to continue to love her.” Here, we learn about the young Arundhati’s life in squalor, sometimes homeless and sleeping in shrines, navigating hairy situations that make for horror reading. This is her forging her own life and identity.
And while they went their separate ways, the two women’s lives remained intrinsically linked. A lot of the memoir isn’t about Mrs Roy, as the mother asked her children to address her so there wouldn’t be any feelings of favouritism at school. But her presence lingers throughout the book. 
The memoir is also about Arundhati growing up and becoming the writer who would document changes in India’s political and cultural fabric. The way she documents the rise of Hindu nationalism or the resistance to the Narmada dam or the communist insurgents the Naxalites is exquisite. She herself asks: “I wanted to test myself… Could I write about irrigation, agriculture, displacement and drainage the way I wrote about love and death?”
Ultimately, this memoir is a testament to an honesty that is rare in today’s world, where everything comes with a filter or trigger warning. I’m thinking of self-proclaimed influencers on social media who profess honesty in their posts about intergenerational trauma or whatever new buzzword is being sold under the guise of wellness or self-care. It is hogwash. Honesty requires courage and reflection.
Roy called herself the “Hooker with the Booker” when she received that prize and recognised the complexity that came with being India’s finest “export” but also its most controversial. “The more I was hounded as an anti-national, the surer I was that India was the place I loved, the place to which I belonged. Where else could I be the hooligan that I was becoming?”
The hooligan notwithstanding, Roy is fiercely protective of Mrs Roy. She is not looking for your sympathy and doesn’t want to condemn her mother either. In writing this memoir, she demonstrates that people are not this or that.
After her passing, her mother’s spectre lingered in Arundhati’s mind and we learn that she carries Mrs Roy’s defiant spirit in her.
The writer is a journalism instructor.
