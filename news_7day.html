President Tokayev was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned out contingent of the armed forces following his arrival.
The two leaders will hold bilateral and delegation-level talks and are expected to sign agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in several sectors.







The Kazakh president arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday for a two-day official visit as the two nations seek to further bolster bilateral ties.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.
FM Dar welcomes Tokayev
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with President Tokayev and welcomed him to Pakistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
During the meeting, Dar “underscored Pakistan’s appreciation for the growing momentum of high-level political exchanges.”
The foreign minister “reaffirmed the shared commitment to expand bilateral cooperation across political, economic, & people-to-people domains, and to work together for durable peace, stability, and development in the region,” FO said.







Agreement to deepen trade, connectivity and investment cooperation
Separately, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan held a comprehensive bilateral meeting with Kazakhstan’s Minister of Trade and Integration Arman Shaqqaliev, at the Ministry of Commerce in Islamabad on Wednesday.
The two sides explored avenues for expanding economic cooperation, connectivity and investment, according to a press release.
“Both sides agreed that improved rail, road and multimodal connectivity is fundamental to strengthening Pakistan–Kazakhstan trade and enabling sustainable, long-term economic engagement,” the statement said.
The Kazakh minister highlighted the strategic importance of developing major infrastructure projects, particularly railway and road corridors. He emphasised Kazakhstan’s vision of becoming a regional hub connecting Central Asia with South Asia, China, Europe and the Global South, including Pakistan’s ports, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Jam Kamal Khan said that improved transit routes would not only benefit Pakistan and Kazakhstan but also open broader opportunities for regional and global trade.
“Both ministers discussed cooperation in priority sectors, including agriculture and food security, pharmaceuticals, textiles, sports goods, leather products, mining and minerals, energy, and infrastructure development,” the statement said.
The meeting also reviewed the need for structured business-to-business (B2B) engagement. It was agreed to work towards finalising a framework document outlining priority sectors, trade targets and a roadmap of activities, including trade missions, exhibitions and exchange of delegations.
“Both ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to transforming Pakistan–Kazakhstan economic relations from potential to performance,” the statement added.
They expressed confidence that sustained institutional coordination and private-sector engagement would significantly enhance bilateral trade and investment in the coming years.
‘Important and timely opportunity’
In a handout issued earlier on Tuesday, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.
This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112028cf39dda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971007/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit.
Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.
The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.
With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.
It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.
Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.
“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.
The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.
“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.
The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate, under scrutiny.
The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.
Confidence restored
Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.
However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.
“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.
“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.
The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.
The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.
Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.
Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.
When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.
Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.
For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04105104e1cd3fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970826/pti-wraps-up-late-night-sit-in-near-adiala-jail-imran-remains-out-of-reach' target='_blank'><strong>PTI wraps up late-night sit-in near Adiala jail; Imran remains out of reach</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After accusing the police of subjecting its workers to violence and detaining them near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, the PTI wrapped up its sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday.
The IHC has allowed Imran twice-a-week meetings — on Tuesday and Thursdays — with his family, lawyers and other associates. Despite the order, the ex-premier has not been allowed any visitors for weeks, including his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
Therefore, protests and sit-ins near the Adiala jail, where Imran has been incarcerated since September 2023, have become a usual occurrence on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka — a police picket near the prison.
Imran’s sisters and supporters again staged a sit-in near the prison on Tuesday, while a PTI post on social media platform X alleged that police had inflicted violence on party workers and arrested them.







A livestream on the PTI’s YouTube channel showed one of Imran’s sisters, Aleema Khanum, surrounded by party workers and supporters, including children, sitting on the ground and shouting slogans.



However, videos posted by PTI leader Aliya Hamza Malik from earlier in the evening showed men, appearing to be policemen, detaining people. Malik claimed in her post on X that lawmaker Mehar Abdul Sattar, along with party workers, had been arrested.







A video posted by Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi showed a large contingent of police in riot gear. The caption said “a large contingent of police is approaching”.







The sit-in continued despite the alleged police action, with Imran’s all three sisters present. While the protest was still under way until a short while after midnight, the number of participants had reduced by then.
Naeem Haider Panjutha, who is a spokesperson to Imran on legal affairs and was present at the sit-in, posted on X at 12:44am that their protest was continuing.
However, at around 1:30am, he wrote, “The sit-in has ended for the release of arrested [party] workers.”
A video shared by him showed Aleema sitting in a car and speaking to Panjutha.







Speaking to reporters at the spot earlier, Aleema demanded a meeting with Imran and immediate medical treatment for his eye condition Al-Shifa Hospital.
“They have made a joke out of this, they have to provide him medical treatment,” she emphasised.
The PTI has been raising concerns about Imran’s health after reports emerged, and later the government confirmed, that he was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
Aleema, flanked by Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum, also requested CM Afridi to “do something to get Imran free”. “You may shut down KP. What is happening with Imran in Punjab … you should come here.”














Speaking to Geo News, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said last week that the former premier was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on Imran’s eye on the night of January 24. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
The PTI has also condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
Aleema said about the development today that information about the Pims visit had been “leaked” and neither she, nor anyone else in Imran’s family was informed.
“They quietly took him late at night. They might be worried that something might happen to him (Imran), but why leak it?” she questioned. “Why weren’t we told that he was taken to the hospital?” Aleema added.
She said they had to meet Imran and said that Imran medical check-up be conducted in the presence of his physician, Dr Aasim Yusuf. She also called for the examination of Imran’s eye by a specialist doctor.
While Aleema was staging a sit-in, the Rawalpindi sub-divisional police officer approached her with warrants issued for her by an anti-terrorism court in the garrison city on Monday, and Aleema signed the warrants.
PTI to file another contempt plea
Earlier, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja was at the Islamabad High Court to initiate the process of filing yet another contempt of court petition against Adiala jail authorities for repeatedly denying party leaders permission to meet Imran.
Announcing that his party’s plans to again move the court against jail authorities, Raja said while speaking to reporters on the court premises that this would be the “sixth contempt petition” filed on the matter.
The PTI and Imran’s sisters both have previously filed contempt petitions against Adiala jail authorities over non-compliance with the IHC order.
Today, Raja said while speaking to reporters at the IHC that he was at the court to file “another contempt of court petition” over what he deemed was “continued and deliberate non-compliance with court orders”.
“This is not the first time; this is the sixth contempt petition,” Raja said, adding that despite clear judicial directions, prison officials had consistently obstructed access to the PTI founder.
“No constitution prevents a prisoner from speaking, and the jail rule being cited to restrict meetings is itself unconstitutional,” he asserted, without specifying which rule he was referring to.
Raja maintained that while incarceration lawfully curtailed a person’s physical freedom, it did not “extinguish fundamental rights altogether”.
The PTI leader said while a prisoner’s freedom was taken away, they could not be deprived of their capability to think and speak.
“When someone goes to meet a prisoner, he can say whatever comes to his mind. There is no law that allows the state to censor thought or speech in this manner,” the PTI leader added.







Raja alleged that restrictions on meetings with Imran were “not administrative but political in nature”, aimed at “silencing the former premier and controlling the political narrative”.
“An attempt is being made to hide the hollowness of the system,” he said, further alleging that authorities were trying to bury what he described as the “lie of February 8” — seemingly a reference to the 2024 general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly alleged were rigged.







He alleged that efforts were being made to hide that “people’s vote was robbed”, further accusing the state of “sending a message of submission” to the public. “They are telling the people that your destiny is only subjugation, that your vote and your voice have no value,” he said, without naming anyone.
Raja further alleged that the continued denial of meetings with Imran was intended to create an atmosphere of fear and helplessness.
“They are giving the people the impression that the freedom of your leaders is at our mercy,” he said, adding that such actions struck at the heart of democratic norms and constitutional guarantees.
Raja described Imran Khan as the country’s most popular political leader and claimed that those in power were unnerved by his influence even from behind bars.
“The founder of PTI is the biggest leader in the country, and today they are scared and terrified,” he said. “Their aim is to silence the voice of the founder of PTI.”

Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men.
“Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said.
While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years.
In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule.
He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.
In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.
Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021.
Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades.
He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

Medical tests reports [available with Dawn] revealed that a 22-year-old transperson from Mian Channu tehsil (Khanewal district) was tested positive for mpox and HIV on Jan 13, 2026. He was suffering from fever and rashes on his body.
The second patient, a 20-year-old police constable belonging to Muzaffargarh district, was also tested positive for HIV and mpox on Feb 2.
According to sources, the constable was suffering from rashes and he tried to flee from the scene as his blood samples were taken for tests. The guards of Nishtar Hospital stopped him and the results of the tests confirmed that he is tested positive for mpox and HIV.

Both infected with HIV too; screening of their contacts under way

Later, he was shifted to isolation ward No: 27 in Nishtar Hospital.
The health department officials confirmed that the patients were shifted to a designated isolation area at Nishtar Hospital after testing positive through PCR-based laboratory analysis conducted at a public health reference laboratory in Punjab.
Officials said both patients are being monitored by infectious disease specialists, while standard infection prevention and control measures have been implemented to prevent further spread of the virus within the healthcare facility.
Health authorities have also initiated contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the patients. Surveillance has been enhanced in Multan and surrounding districts, and hospitals have been advised to remain alert for patients with symptoms consistent with mpox.Nishtar Hospital Additional Medical Superintendent Dr Riwad Noor told Dawn that both patients did not have any travel history.
He said the WHO guidelines suggested that any patient, who suffers from HIV, would lose immunity and it could develop mpox.
He said Khanewal and Muzaffargarh district health authorities should take measures to check and stop spread of the infectious disease.He said the recovery of the patients is possible.
Medical Superintendent Rao Amjad also confirmed that an isolation ward was established at the hospital to deal with patients with infectious diseases.Muzaffargarh District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Fayyaz Khan Gopang told this reporter that they have started screening of the family members of the patient and samples for tests were taken.
He said he would also contact the district police officer to check about the posting of the constable and would conduct screening of the people in contact with him.
District Khanewal CEO Health Dr Asif Mahmood said the person of Tehsil Mian Channu was tested positive for mpox and HIV on Jan 13 and the rapid response team of the district screened all of his immediate contacts and did not find any one else infected with the disease.
He said the patient is a transperson and he would often organise and attend social gatherings and they were still chasing the people who might have been infected but did not find any other with symptoms.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox is a viral disease that usually begins with fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue, followed by a rash that can develop into fluid-filled lesions. Most cases are mild, but early medical care helps prevent complications.
WHO advises that the spread of mpox can be reduced through avoiding close physical contact with anyone who has a rash or symptoms suggestive of mpox, practising regular hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based sanitisers, not sharing bedding, towels, clothing or personal items with infected individuals, ensuring suspected or confirmed patients isolate until their lesions have healed and seeking prompt medical care if fever, body aches or unexplained rashes develop.

Increasingly, there are calls to either abandon or dilute the IMF programme, with critics pointing to high interest rates, elevated taxes and costly energy as justification. While these concerns are valid, the conclusion that leaving the IMF would restore growth is misguided. In reality, abandoning the IMF programme would likely reignite the instability that made external support necessary in the first place. The true challenge for Pakistan is not a choice between stabilisation and growth, but rather how to use the limited fiscal space created by stabilisation to support productive activity without violating IMF commitments. This fiscal space does exist, and now more than ever, it must be deployed wisely.
External pressures and competitiveness: The urgency of this task has increased due to the EU-India trade agreement, which will gradually reduce tariffs on Indian exports to the EU — Pakistan’s largest export market, accounting for about 40 per cent of its exports, mainly textiles. This development represents a direct shock to Pakistan’s competitiveness. Preference erosion will be gradual but persistent. Without tariff preference relative to India, exports from Pakistan are vulnerable. Even without duty-free access, India exports nearly as much textile and apparel to the EU as Pakistan, and with significant overlap in product lines, substitution is inevitable. As tariffs decrease, Indian exports could become 10-12pc cheaper than before. India is also working to recapture the exports it lost as a result of US tariffs. Any further deterioration in Pakistan’s cost, quality, or delivery will quickly lead to lost orders and more idle capacity, as well as pressure on jobs and foreign exchange reserves.
Some estimates suggest that Pakistan could lose up to $2 billion from its current $9bn to $10bn in annual EU exports. Therefore, maintaining market share in Europe requires more than generic appeals to industrial revival — it demands precise, targeted interventions. The primary constraint is fiscal space.
Policy rate and fiscal space: One starting point is the policy rate. Once inflation expectations are firmly anchored and foreign exchange reserves exceed $20bn, a 100-basis-point reduction in policy rates would have significant fiscal implications. Even accounting for delays in repricing and transmission, a one-percentage point reduction in the average cost of domestic borrowing could save Rs450bn to Rs550bn annually in debt-servicing costs over time, depending on the maturity structure. Additional fiscal space can also be created by containing non-development expenditures.

The hard reality is that Pakistan cannot simply spend, borrow, or subsidise its way to growth.

Importantly, this space should be explicitly redirected towards growth-enabling interventions. Three main priorities emerge:
Supporting export-oriented industry: While broad-based tax reductions are limited under the IMF programme, targeted relief for exporters is both fiscally efficient and beneficial for the external sector. Minimum taxes on turnover and advance taxes, for which refunds take years, are particularly detrimental to exporters’ cash flows. Since exports are vital for Pakistan’s economy, relying instead on commercial borrowing to build reserves is expensive, with the country’s 10-year bond yield exceeding 10pc. Rationalising electricity tariffs for export sectors and eliminating cross-subsidies in industrial power prices would directly enhance competitiveness. Instead of a piecemeal, reactionary approach, the government should conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of costs, levies and taxes with Pakistan’s major export competitors and address the gaps.

 

Incentivising diversification: Pakistan’s export base remains narrow not due to a lack of incentives, but because existing schemes are misdirected — rewarding scale in established products rather than encouraging diversification. In a global context where competitors are securing preferential access to major trade blocs, this approach is unsustainable. A portion of available fiscal space should be allocated to new products, value-added processing, and untapped markets, ensuring incentives drive incremental exports instead of reinforcing old patterns.
Reviving SMEs: While large firms dominate exports, SMEs are the backbone of employment and supply chains. Years of macroeconomic volatility, high borrowing costs, punitive documentation requirements, unreliable energy, and inflated input costs — often a result of tariff protection — have severely weakened the SME sector. Any growth strategy that overlooks SMEs will struggle to create jobs. Interest savings can be partially redirected into credit guarantees, concessional refinance windows linked to export activity and simplified tax regimes that incentivise formalisation. Even an allocation of Rs50bn to Rs70bn could mobilise more private credit significantly.
Role of the IMF programme: None of these measures require abandoning the IMF programme. On the contrary, their effectiveness depends on the credibility provided by the programme. Sustainable lower interest rates require anchored inflation expectations; export incentives are meaningful only with a market-determined exchange rate; energy reforms can only last if circular debt is contained — disciplines that the IMF programme enforces.
Conclusion: The hard reality is that Pakistan cannot simply spend, borrow, or subsidise its way to growth. The available fiscal space is limited and must not be wasted. In an era of increasing external competition, fiscal resources must be justified by their impact on productivity, export protection, or employment generation. The real choice is not between growth and the IMF, but between discipline and wishful thinking. Abandoning the programme may offer short-term relief, but it would ultimately restore the instability that undermined growth in the first place. The only sustainable path is to use the IMF programme as a foundation for protecting competitiveness, expanding exports, and rebuilding employment, thereby avoiding another crisis.

The talks were held late Tuesday against the backdrop of a recently finalised bilateral trade deal that has drawn attention across the region.
Diplomatic observers in Washington, however, maintain that the agreement is unlikely to affect recently improved bilateral ties between Pakistan and the United States, as those are not linked to India.
The observers note that recent developments in the greater Middle East, as well as in South and Central Asia, have further enhanced Pakistan’s relevance as a key regional player in Washington’s strategic calculus.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during the latter’s three-day official visit to the United States, as both sides moved to deepen economic and strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific.







According to the US State Department readout, Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar discussed “formalizing bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration, mining, and processing,” an area of growing importance amid global supply chain realignments and competition over energy transition resources.
The meeting came ahead of the inaugural critical minerals ministerial scheduled for Wednesday and followed the conclusion of a long-pending trade agreement between Washington and New Delhi. Under the deal, the United States has agreed to reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent after nearly a year of negotiations.
“Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal reached between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi,” the US statement said, adding that the two leaders “emphasized the importance of our democracies working together to unlock new economic opportunities and advance our shared energy security goals.”
In a post on social media, Secretary Rubio said: “Met Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar to discuss our bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration and work together to unlock new economic opportunities between our two countries. We also commended the trade deal between the United States and India.”
Jaishankar, in his own message, said he was “delighted to meet US Secretary Rubio this afternoon,” describing it as “a wide-ranging conversation that covered our bilateral cooperation agenda, regional and global issues.”
“Facets of India - US Strategic Partnership discussed included trade, energy, nuclear, defence, critical minerals and technology,” he said, adding: “Agreed on the early meetings of various mechanisms to advance our shared interests.”







The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to expanding “bilateral and multilateral cooperation” through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which brings together the United States, India, Japan and Australia. The US readout said the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing their commitment to strengthening cooperation through the Quad, while acknowledging that “a prosperous Indo-Pacific region remains vital to advancing our shared interests.”
Pakistan, which has been seeking to stabilise its economic relations with Washington while navigating an increasingly polarised regional environment, is also attending the critical minerals meeting.
Pakistani participation in the Washington gathering is seen as part of broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation in the development and processing of critical minerals.</p><small>2026-02-04 04:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6982726e71bbb.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970983/rising-threat-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Rising threat in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>THE separatist militancy, which has gripped Balochistan for the past two decades, now seems to have escalated into a full-blown insurgency. Last week, hundreds of armed terrorists launched simultaneous attacks reportedly in 12 locations, including the provincial capital Quetta. They stormed security installations, set government buildings on fire and looted banks. Highly trained terrorists engaged the security forces in gun battles for hours, revealing their capacity to challenge the state.
While the government claims to have killed 145 terrorists and restored order, such large-scale attacks, which breach even high security zones such as the provincial capital and cause many casualties among security officials and civilians, are highly disturbing. The violence brought the province to a standstill. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has claimed responsibility for this massive terrorist attack, has also asked for people’s backing. The spectacle of a large number of terrorists launching such audacious and coordinated attacks across the province indicates the organisation is not without backing.
There has been a sharp escalation in Baloch separatist violence over the past five years, with 2025, the deadliest year on record. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025 (a 26 per cent increase from the previous year) resulting in more than 400 deaths.
In recent times, the terrorists appear to have shifted from a hit-and-run strategy to one aimed at taking control of territory, though briefly. There have been incidents when dozens of heavily armed terrorists have stormed district headquarters and taken control of it before dispersing. Not only were the attacks targeted, according to reports, the terrorists also clashed with the security forces and blocked highways that connect Balochistan to other parts of Pakistan.

The latest terrorist attacks in Balochistan undermine claims that the situation is under control.

Last year, BLA terrorists carried out one of their most audacious attacks, hijacking the Jaffer Express, which was travelling from Quetta to KP. Over 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which 33 militants were killed. But despite the killing of so many terrorists by the security forces, there seems to be no cessation in the number of militant attacks. In fact, they have also increased in intensity. The latest terrorist attacks undermine the government’s claim that the situation is under control.

 

It’s one of the most serious security challenges this country has faced in decades. The latest wave of terrorist violence in the strategically located region is a grim reminder of the resurgence of the menace with greater ferocity. What has made the situation worse is the state’s failure to win public support in its battle against the separatists. Considering that this region has long been the epicentre of political unrest, it is hardly surprising that it witnesses frequent attacks.
Arguably, public discontent has increased over the years as Balochistan has still not been able to get its due political and economic rights. The civilian administration is non-existent in large parts of the province. Besides, the uptick in violence has also been evident following the controversial 2024 national elections. Thanks to electoral manipulation, there is a widespread perception that the government is unrepresentative and has thus failed to establish its authority. Those elections were criticised as marginalising even Baloch nationalists seeking democratic rights within the federal structure.
Moreover, the increasing use of force to curb peaceful protests has inflamed the situation further, providing the terrorists an opportunity to recruit new members. A combination of factors, including the denial of democratic rights, poverty and excesses by the state have pushed many, particularly among the educated youth, towards terrorist groups, which have also recruited women in their ranks.
Some of the major terrorist attacks have been carried out by Baloch women. The terrorist attack in Gwadar last week was reportedly led by a woman. The growing participation of women, mostly from educated middle class backgrounds, shows the widening influence of the terrorist groups.
These groups, with the support of external forces, are now better trained and equipped with sophisticated weaponry, as was seen in the recent attacks. India has openly been supporting the Baloch separatist movement as a part of its ongoing hostilities against Pakistan. There is strong evidence of separatist leaders having close links with the Indian intelligence agencies. Regional geopolitics is another factor behind the escalation of such attacks.
Afghanistan has long been a safe haven for Baloch terrorists. The return of Taliban rule and the escalating tension between Kabul and Islamabad have given even greater space to the terrorists to operate from. The terrorists have now acquired sophisticated weapons left behind by Nato forces as they exited Afghanistan in 2021. Some of the Baloch separatist factions are said to have made a tactical alliance with the banned TTP, which is being patronised by the Afghan Taliban regime.
Moreover, a long porous border with Iran also provides a cross-border sanctuary for the insurgents in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. A long coastal belt provides the militants a safe supply line. The areas along the sea and those bordering Iran have been the worst affected by terrorism.
It is also the region where China is helping develop Gwadar, a key seaport on the Arabian Sea. The increased targeting of Chinese nationals working on various CPEC projects carries strong geopolitical implications. The BLA, which claimed the attacks, threatened intensified attacks on key Chinese interests unless China withdraw from the region.
A mix of internal and external factors has complicated the Balochistan problem. But it is the growing political alienation of the Baloch people from the state that has made it harder to deal with the separatist insurgency. The country cannot confront the challenge without addressing the people’s grievances. A population that is deprived of its basic democratic and economic rights is estranged from the state.

KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday on the latter’s invitation. The two appear to have had a largely cordial engagement. They talked about the need for close cooperation between the centre and KP, reportedly agreeing that such coordination was “vital for peace, development and public welfare in the province”. The CM shared with Mr Sharif concerns about his province’s finances, as well as counterterrorism and the ongoing law and order crisis. It may be recalled that Mr Afridi was picked for the KP chief minister’s office because he is a ‘fighter’. It now appears that he may also be a man who can be reasoned with.

 

Reciprocating goodwill, the PM is said to have assured Mr Afridi that the centre would cooperate and support KP’s development projects, infrastructure improvement, education, health and employment generation. And, in a break from the more confrontational stance taken by other stakeholders, Mr Sharif also acknowledged that the KP government has an important role to play in establishing peace in the province, but urged the provincial administration to improve the law-and-order situation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts.
“National unity, stability and prosperity can be achieved effectively through mutual consultation and collaboration,” the PM was quoted as saying. Though no one expected the two to come to blows during their tête-à-tête, the general lack of hostility seen during the meeting was just as surprising. After all, the PTI and PML-N have been pursuing a relentless vendetta against each other, which has routinely devolved into ugly behaviour by both sides.
Parties routinely politick against each other; indeed, they should — this is what gives a democracy its lifeblood. However, it is also important to set politics aside, especially when the challenges are so immense that collaboration instead of confrontation is required. KP continues to face extreme violence, and its long-standing fight against terrorism may be at risk of experiencing reversals. The province is cash-strapped and needs sustained support from the centre to address its many administrative and governance problems.
Mr Afridi had previously turned down meetings with the PM, possibly owing to pressures from within his party to appear more aggressive and adversarial towards the federation amidst the crackdown on its leaders. However, it seems that the young leader is now realising that he represents not just the PTI, but also the people of KP, including those who may not have voted for him. It is a sign of maturity and must be encouraged.

RIYADH: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday, Saudi media said, his first visit to the kingdom in over two years as Saudi Arabia moves closer to its rival-turned-ally.
Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues.
This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024.
Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu.
Erdogan is accompanied by his wife, first lady Emine Erd­ogan, Foreign Minister Hak­an Fidan, Finance Minister Meh­met Simsek, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and other ministers.
No further detail on the clos­ed-door meeting was provided.
However, Anadolu has earlier reported that they would discuss the “deepening cooperation” between the countries, as well as regional and global developments.
It added that Erdogan would then travel to Cairo on Wednesday.
Following the meeting, Erdogan attended a closed-door dinner in his honour, hosted by the Saudi crown prince at the Yemame Palace.
This is Erdogan’s first to the kingdom since July 2023, which was part of a Gulf trip aimed at drumming up investments.
The visit comes days after two sources told AFP that Turkiye would not be joining a mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan had said earlier this month that they had entered talks aimed at joining the alliance.
‘Balance thaw’
Experts like Umar Karim of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom warn that Turkiye will have to balance any thaw with Riyadh against relations with other regional rivals.
“I think it’s in this visit that it will become clear what Turkiye can commit to Saudis in terms of this rivalry with UAE and in terms of the security threat from Israel,” Karim told AFP.
Relations between Riyadh and Turkiye were enormously strained after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

United States President Donald Trump announced a “trade deal” with India on Monday after speaking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying New Delhi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and may purchase it instead from Venezuela.
Interestingly, the Kremlin said it had not received any indication from India that it would stop buying Russian oil following the announcement of a trade deal with President Trump.
“So far, we haven’t heard any statements from New Delhi on this matter,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Just like the ceasefire, the announcement of the trade deal was also made by US President Trump. It has been stated that the trade deal is being done ‘on Modi’s request’,” the Congress said in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.








Congress leader Jairam Ramesh compares Modi’s stance on deal to his ‘surrender’ during Pakistan-India conflict last year

It slammed the move to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers against the US to zero, saying, “It seems India has agreed to completely open our market for America. This will impact Indian industry, traders and farmers.”
It also questioned whether the security and interests of Indian farmers had been ensured amid talk of opening the agriculture sector to the US, and whether the Modi government had agreed to the condition stated by Trump that it would no longer buy Russian oil. “In addition, there is talk of buying more goods from America. If that’s the case, then what happened to ‘Make in India’?” the post added.
“India has the right to know details of the trade deal. The Modi government must take the Parliament and the entire country into confidence and share all the details.”
American colony
The Kerala chapter of Congress also slammed the move in briefer terms, saying, “Simply put, we will be an American colony.” It pointed out that the US would still have a tariff of 18pc on Indian goods, while India would charge zero tariffs on American goods.
“Resign and get lost,” it said bluntly, addressing Modi.
In a separate post, the opposition party also called the deal “the lowest moment” for India and criticised Modi’s apparent bowing down to Trump.
“Modi surrendered India’s sovereignty to the US to keep his friend and himself out of jail,” it said, apparently referring to businessman and Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani.
The Congress said, “This is the lowest moment for the country. Complete surrender without even fighting!”
Congress member Jairam Ramesh compared Modi’s stance now to his “surrender” during the Pakistan-India conflict in May 2025.
He said that while India-US relations had appeared bright at the start of Trump’s re-election, things had gone “downhill” ever since the US president’s halting of Operation Sindoor on May 10.
“From the information President Trump has provided, it is abundantly clear that Prime Minister Modi has — like he did on May 10, 2025 — completely surrendered. He has most definitely appeased President Trump,” Ramesh said, adding, “India stands diminished by this unfortunate sequence of events.”
He called for both the EU and US trade deals to be laid on the table of both Houses and debated.
Congress member Supriya Shrinate expressed concern over the “deeply worrying” reaction of US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to the announcement, in which she said the deal would “export more American farm products to India’s massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America”.
Minister defends deal
On the other hand, India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal, claiming that it would create more jobs, spur growth and promote innovation in both economies. “It will strengthen ‘Make in India’ endeavors and encourage trusted technology ties,” he said on X.

Thirty-three years later, it led to Bangladesh being expelled from a World Cup.
If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime.
From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion
Let’s begin with the basic details.
On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure, Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur.
Within days, the Indian cricket board, the BCCI “requested” KKR to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”.
Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul reacted, ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul noted that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.”
After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, rejecting Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland.

 

In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, decrying the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan instructed its team to boycott its World Cup game against India.
‘Ocean of vagueness’
So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime?
For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims.
This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs. His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society.
What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken.
According to a report in The Indian Express, the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.”
The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns.
According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to refuse shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025.
Similarly, when the Indian team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.”
The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.”
The question of revenue
But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.
As journalist Taha Hashim wrote in The Guardian, the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.”
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility.
Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February.

 

According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out.
This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter.
Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a blog post that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.”
When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.”
India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance
Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation. [And] the Australian and English cricket boards are no more than the sidekicks of the big don in our game. There is no capable, mature leadership in the ICC anymore.”
That much maligned ICC leadership appeared to be scrambling in the wake of Pakistan’s decision to solely boycott the game against India — the biggest revenue generator in every tournament. In a statement released before they had even formally been notified of the decision by the PCB itself, the ICC made clear that “it expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution”, a much more conciliatory tone than the outright rejection of the BCB’s demands. Clearly, with a huge financial bite to face, the ICC’s priorities have been put to test.

 

The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s.
India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.”
It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer posted on social media platform X, “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.”
Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. Writing after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.”
Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.</p><small>2026-02-04 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04104021dbdb328.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970966/imran-taken-to-pims-at-own-request-says-law-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imran taken to Pims at own request, says law minister</strong></a><br><p>

LAW Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar (left) and Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speak during Tuesday’s session.—Dawn

• Opposition senators slam ‘denial of Imran’s rights’; Tarar tells opposition to approach court for relief concerning PTI founder’s medical care, jail meetings• Ministers detail measures to curb extremism; seek parliamentary debate on National Action Plan-II
ISLAMABAD: The opposition in the Senate was up in arms on Tuesday over what it termed the “denial of human rights” to former prime minister Imran Khan.
However, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told members that Mr Khan had been taken to Pims for a procedure on his own request, and assured the House that he had no health issues following treatment.
He said the federal government fully respected human rights and it had never issued any directive to deny medical treatment to any prisoner.
The law minister also assured the Senate that if any further medical need arose, all facilities would be provided as per law.
However, he hastened to add that any further relief concerning medical care, meetings or prison conditions must be sought through the high court, which was the competent appellate forum.
Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas complained that Mr Khan’s imprisonment was “cruel and illegal”, and asked why was he deprived of his rights and why his family was not informed about his illness.
“A crime has been committed against him, as it is his fundamental right that he did not get,” Senator Abbas said.
He said there was concern among people all over the country over Mr Khan’s health, and described the ban on meetings with the PTI founder as the worst form of political victimisation and violation of human rights.
He expressed the fear that Mr Khan might lose his eyesight and emphasised that he should be checked by a doctor of his choice, and permitted to meet his family. The opposition leader also suggested that senators should visit him in jail.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the fact that PTI founder underwent treatment in secret, and this was later revealed by the government, was a serious issue.
“We appealed that Mr Khan should be allowed to meet his personal physicians for a complete investigation. If it was a small procedure, the nation would be satisfied,” he said, adding that this meeting was not allowed.
Following this, Mr Khan’s doctors in a video message called the issue very serious in nature, showing concerns that he could face permanent damage to his eyesight, he added.
They recommended names of two experts who should be given access to Mr Khan for complete investigation, he said.
He said the doctors were not satisfied with the Pims report, and asked that two experts should be given access to Mr Khan immediately.
He also recalled that when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was diagnosed with low platelets, then-PM Imran Khan had said that he should get proper treatment and allowed doctors, even his personal physician, to examine him in jail.
“I am not talking about politics right now,” he said, urging the chair to direct Pims to provide them with Mr Khan’s medical report.
Unity in face of extremism
During Tuesday’s proceedings, two key ministers noted that complete national unity was imperative to effectively counter extremism.
During Question Hour, Inform­a­tion Minister Attaullah Tarar des­cribed the recent meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Sohail Afridi and PM Shehbaz Sharif as a positive development that would help strengthen coordination.
Mr Tarar said that cooperation between the federal government and the province was vital for improving the law & order situation.
He said this cooperation would convey a message of unity and help eliminate terrorism.
He informed the House that a Counter Violent Extremism Cell has been established in the information ministry and a third-party audit system has been put in place to assess the outreach and dissemination of the narrative generated by the cell.
Mr Tarar said that a fully functional digital communication department is working under the cell to counter extremist narratives through digital media.
He said the Paigham-i-Aman Committee, comprising scholars from all schools of thought, minority representatives and senior government officials, was actively working to promote peace and counter extremism in the country.
He said the committee was actively touring the country to promote a counter-narrative against extremism, violence, and terrorism. Giving the composition of the committee, he said the committee comprised several religious scholars and representatives of minority communities.
Spearately, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry also stres­sed the importance of national unity.
Speaking in the House, he noted that past success against terrorism had only been achieved when all political forces stood united behind the security forces, emphasising that similar unity was required once again to defeat extremism and terrorism.
Mr Chaudhry underlined the need for a full parliamentary debate on the 14-point National Action Plan-II (NAP-II), noting that the original NAP had been formulated after the Army Public School tragedy during the PML-N government and later revised during the PTI government with the consensus of all provinces.
He said the government was ready to present a detailed briefing on the implementation of all NAP-II points, including provincial and federal performance, if the House decided to allocate time for an in-depth discussion.
About the government’s broader strategy to counter extremism, he said that both kinetic and non-kinetic measures were being pursued simultaneously.

ISLAMABAD: The federal government has declined Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s request for Rs10.4 billion in additional expenditure linked to the settlement of displaced persons from Bajaur and the Tirah Valley following security operations, asking the provincial administration to meet these expenses from its own resources.
The Centre also expressed its inability to increase provincial transfers on account of net hydel profit beyond Rs3bn per month currently being given to the province due to fiscal limitations and legal precincts. The Centre, however, indicated to disburse about Rs26bn on an urgent basis on account of the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) for the development of KP’s newly merged districts, previously called Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
This followed a series of meetings between the federal and provincial leadership over the last two days, beginning with a session led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday. The provincial government made a pitch for recovery of a total of Rs426bn “outstanding federal liabilities payable to KP”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aur­angzeb and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal then sat down with KP’s team, led by KP Finance Minister Muzzammil Aslam, on Tuesday to follow up on those demands.
Informed sources said the province also demanded an early requisition of the second meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC).
Mr Aurangzeb reportedly asked Mr Muzzammil to complete the recommendations of a working group he headed on the question of requirements of merged districts and promised to call an NFC meeting soon.
The provincial government argued that Fata’s merger with KP in May 2018 increased the provincial population from around 31 million to 37m, with the area expanding from 74,521 square kilometres to 101,741. It argued that this should have automatically and proportionately increased KP’s share in NFC to 19pc from the existing 14.6pc. However, this gap of around 4.5pc created a
colossal burden. It said this year’s budget estimate for current expenditures of merged districts stood at Rs143bn, but the Centre had allocated only Rs80bn, even less than last year’s Rs105bn. For AIP 2025-26, the government had made a Rs100bn commitment but disbursed only Rs37bn in seven months.
Separately, KP reported that about 2,000 displaced families were staying at Babakhel Camp in North Waziristan, while another 15,000 families from the area were receiving Rs20,000 per month, amounting to around Rs4.2bn a year.
The province said it spent Rs19bn in FY24 and FY25 and a further Rs10.4bn so far this year due to the Bajaur and Tirah operations, without federal support.
Of the Rs426bn claim, KP said the largest chunk of Rs194.5bn pertained to federal excise duty on crude oil under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which it said had remained unimplemented since FY11. It said another Rs75bn pertained to a windfall levy on crude oil production and Rs64bn was linked to water supply from the Galiyat Development Authority to Murree since 1947.
‘Cooperative federalism’
A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance said the meeting between the financial teams of federal and provincial government focused on a range of fiscal and development matters, including the timely release of funds under key development heads for merged districts, outstanding requirements linked to rehabilitation and support for temporarily displaced persons, and the broader framework of provincial entitlements and allocations, including those related to the NFC.
The KP team highlighted the operational and development imperatives in the merged districts and underscored the importance of predictable and timely releases to sustain ongoing schemes and meet pressing needs on the ground.
They also drew attention to pending obligations in respect of displaced families and other related commitments that require streamlined coordination and resolution.
Mr Aurangzeb “reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to cooperative federalism and constructive engagement with the provinces”, the statement said.
He assured KP of his support in pursuing and facilitating their rightful claims for allocations under the NFC and other relevant heads discussed during the meeting, in accordance with applicable rules, agreed frameworks and due process.
The minister also emphasised that “effective coordination and timely reconciliation of accounts, where required, remain essential for smooth and transparent releases, and emphasised that the federal government remains mindful of the unique development and security-related challenges faced by KP, particularly in the merged districts”.
The meeting also reviewed ongoing work and consultations on NFC-related matters, including the need to sustain momentum on technical discussions and subgroup engagements to advance consensus on key issues and agreed to continue close coordination through relevant forums and technical channels to address outstanding matters on priority and to ensure that fiscal arrangements and releases support development objectives and service delivery.

Oil prices rose and the dollar mostly dipped as investors weighed company earnings against geopolitical unrest.
The price of gold climbed more than six per cent to $4,989.20 an ounce. Last week it reached a record-high close to $5,600 before tumbling. Gold is “heading for its biggest daily gain since 2008, as prices rebounded sharply following the steepest two-day decline in decades,” said analyst Axel Rudolph at trading platform IG.
Silver surged more than 15pc to $86 on Tuesday, still well short of the record near $120 it hit last week.
“A sense of calm descended after the precious metal ructions, opening the door for investors to buy on the dip,” noted Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.
Gold and silver prices have been on a tear in recent months, benefitting from being seen as a safe haven investments during times of geopolitical tensions.
Demand for the precious metals was also being spurred by sliding value of the dollar, which was weakened by speculation that US President Donald Trump is happy to see the world’s reserve currency weaken despite the potential risk of pushing up US inflation.

ISLAMABAD / DUBAI: Tehran has asked for a change of venue ahead of planned talks between US and Iranian officials this week, after President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed ordering the initiation of dialogue with Washington.
On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington.
According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.
The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only.
This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.
Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said.
However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups.
“I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.”
Hectic diplomacy
Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal.
“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X.







He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”.
On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”.
Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”.
“I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash.
Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities.
When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities.
Pakistan’s role
“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday.
“Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn.
The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting.
The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters, adding that some regional powers were also invited.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday.
Last-minute change?
According to Reuters, a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks.
“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.”
A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

QUETTA: The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks, staged across the province on Saturday.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, DC office and an FC camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.
District police officials told Dawn that at least four more terrorists had been killed in clearance actions conducted so far.
They also indicated that the counterterrorism department had suffered casualties during the terror attacks over the weekend, but there was no official word on their exact number, or the identities of those martyred.
There were also reports of attacks in Awaran, but no loss of life was immediately reported.
Security forces are also conducting operations in the Washuk area, following attacks there and the burning of a police station and a Nadra office over the weekend.
IGP pays tribute
Separately, Inspector General of Police Mohammad Tahir said Balochistan police had rendered unparalleled sacrifices for the restoration of peace and protection of lives in the province, with many officers and personnel attaining martyrdom while thwarting the designs of terrorists.
Paying tribute to the fallen policemen, the IGP emphasised that lasting peace in Balochistan could only be achieved through close cooperation between the public and security forces, stressing that the police and the people stand united against terrorism.
He made these remarks during visits to various police facilities, including Sariab Police Station, New Sariab Police Station, Police Training College, Smart Police Station, Manzoor Tareen Shaheed and Khaliq Shaheed Police Station, where he reviewed security arrangements and overall performance.
CTD DIG Aitzaz Goraya, Quetta SSP Mohammad Asif Khan and other senior officers accompanied him.
Later, the IGP visited the Anti-Terrorism Force (ATF) headquarters, where he met officers and personnel and was briefed on operational challenges. Praising their high morale, professionalism and dedication to duty, he said the role of Balochistan police in the fight against terrorism has been commendable.
Reaffirming his resolve, IGP Tahir said the Balochistan police remains fully prepared and vigilant to counter all challenges and is utilising all available resources to ensure law and order.
He added that the force has consistently taken timely action against anti-state elements and will continue to safeguard the lives and property of citizens, pledging that no sacrifice would be spared. He said efforts are underway to enhance police capacity and equip the force with modern facilities.
Chinese condemnation
Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism.
He made these remarks during a regular press briefing. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
“China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added.
On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”.
In a post on X, the embassy said “we… deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”.

LONDON: JPMorgan is finalising plans for a new index to track frontier market local currency bonds, investors consulted on the details told Reuters, as the bank looks to satisfy a growing appetite for riskier and more diversified high-yield debt.
The move, which comes 15 years after the Wall Street bank launched its hard-currency Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM) frontier index, coincides with the year-long slump in the dollar and some extraordinary recent rallies in markets like Argentina, Ecuador and Uganda.
JPMorgan declined to comment on the plans.
Six leading money managers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the bank’s engagements with them reached an advanced stage in the second half of last year.
The proposed index includes 20 to 25 countries, with Egypt, Vietnam, Kenya, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh having the largest “weightings”, three of the managers said.
Bond sizes and caps on weighting
According to one source, there would be a limit that means no country has a weighting of more than 8 per cent. A second source said an earlier consultation document had a proposed 10pc limit.
It is also set to only include bonds of at least $250 million equivalent, although that has raised issues around Zambia, which many would like to see included but has traditionally only sold smaller individual bonds.
“We expect they (JPMorgan) will give us a formal structure for the index around June with the opportunity to make some final comments,” said one senior fund manager.
“They are then likely to formally launch the index next year, we think.” Another senior fund manager said the initial announcement might be as early as the end of March, which could also bring the formal launch date forward.
Trillion dollar market FTSE
Russell has already had an equivalent index since 2021. JPMorgan’s versions, however, are more prominent among emerging market money managers, who effectively use them to compile their funds and measure their performance.
Analysis by Neuberger Berman estimates tradable local-currency debt has trebled over the last decade to around $1 trillion.
It also calculates that over the last eight years, frontier market local FX debt had outperformed JPMorgan’s mainstream emerging market local currency index by almost 2.5 percentage points, and also outstripped the EM dollar bond index.

 

“We see that as a confirmation that frontier market growth and general economic performance has been systematically underpriced,” Neuberger Berman’s Rob Drijkoningen said.
According to the World Bank, frontier economies are home to a fifth of the world’s population but account for just 3.1pc of global capital flows and less than 5pc of global GDP.
Their populations, however, are expected to increase by another 800 million over the next 25 years more than the rest of the world combined — meaning they will play an increasingly important role in global economic growth.
Analysts expect JPMorgan’s new debt index to help expand local currency bond markets — something long-championed by the World Bank and IMF as a way to reduce the number of debt crises caused when currency crashes leave governments unable to pay hard-currency debt.
Zambia and eligibility requirements
The rising interest in frontier market debt also comes as shaken confidence in once-safe debt in the developed world pushes capital flows to other parts of the globe.
Three of the investors raised questions about Zambia, which until recently had only sold sub-$250 million local-currency bonds.
It was not in some of JPMorgan’s early outlines, the investors said, but the country has since issued at least one larger bond, raising hopes it will now make the cut.
One eligibility requirement that mirrors JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index of major emerging economies is that included bonds will have more than 2.5 years of remaining maturity — the time before full repayment is due.
JPMorgan estimated in September the index will have approximately 400 basis points or more of “pick-up” in yield over the GBI-EM, with over 60pc of the index constituents yielding more than 10pc.
A potential promotion of top-weighted countries like Egypt and Nigeria to the GBI-EM index in coming years is another issue that could alter the index’s makeup, possibly putting off some investors.
“It will be important to nail that down,” one senior fund manager said.

The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar received President Tokayev at Rawalpindi’s Nur Khan Base.







According to state-run Radio Pakistan, a 21-gun salute was presented to the visiting dignitary.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later posted on X that he was “delighted” to welcome the Kazakh President to Pakistan.
“I look forward to our meaningful and productive engagements tomorrow. The Pakistan-Kazakhstan friendship is a time-tested partnership that continues to bring our peoples closer together. This visit marks a new milestone in our glorious journey,” he said.







Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, who also welcomed the Kazakh preisdent at Nur Khan Base, also said on X: “Honoured to welcome His Excellency Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, on his two-day official visit to Pakistan. He was received at the airport by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“This will be a great visit in terms of strong ties between both countries and we look forward to further strengthening our friendship and bilateral cooperation.”







Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.



In a handout issued earlier in the day, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.

 

This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Kazakh Minister of Science and Higher Education Sayasat Nurbek was already on a visit to Pakistan.
Eight memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed on Monday between the higher education institutions of the two countries to promote joint research collaboration, faculty and student exchanges, collaborative academic programmes, and capacity-building initiatives.
As part of the collaboration, Kazakhstan educational centres were inaugurated at three public sector universities in Islamabad.
In September, when then-Kazakh deputy premier Murat Nurtleu visited Pakistan, the two sides signed the Action Plan of Cooperation to boost bilateral ties.</p><small>2026-02-03 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0323022721d679c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970843/us-shoots-down-iranian-drone-aggressively-approaching-aircraft-carrier-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>US shoots down Iranian drone ‘aggressively’ approaching aircraft carrier, official says</strong></a><br><p>The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, it said.
The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” and was shot down by an American F-35 fighter jet, it said.
“An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defence and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military’s Central Command.
No American service members were harmed during the incident and no US equipment was damaged, he added.
The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and US President Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.
The Lincoln carrier strike group is the most visible part of a US military buildup in the Middle East following a crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.
Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast.
He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.
Central Command said that in another incident today, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged and crewed merchant vessel.
“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said.
Meanwhile, the White House said talks between US and Iranian officials were “still scheduled” this week after the drone was shot down.
US envoy Steve Witkoff “is set to have conversations with the Iranians later this week; those are still scheduled as of right now”, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News.</p><small>2026-02-03 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0321590934a4e57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970840/federal-constitutional-court-disposes-of-arshad-sharif-suo-motu-case' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court disposes of Arshad Sharif suo motu case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Tuesday disposed of a suo motu case initiated on the killing of prominent journalist Arshad Sharif in Kenya, ruling that judicial oversight of the ongoing investigation was impermissible under Pakistani law.
The court emphasised that the matter was being handled through diplomatic channels and a mutual legal assistance (MLA) agreement between Pakistan and Kenya had also already been reached.
The 14-page judgment was authored by Justice Aamer Farooq and disposed of all pending applications.
“We acknowledge and share the grief felt by our nation and the journalist community over the death of our citizen,” the judgment said.
“Needless to observe that in case the legal heirs of Sharif have any specific grievance in the matter, they can approach the court(s) of competent jurisdiction,” it added.
The judgment said that in the present case, the MLA had been signed between Pakistan and Kenya, adding that both countries were coordinating at a diplomatic level to implement it.
“We were of the view that the authorities of both countries are taking appropriate action under their respective laws,” the judgment said, adding that there was no need for any judicial interference in this regard when the law and investigation were taking their due course.
The judgment said that if the FCC issued any judicial order directing the state, including the federal government, to represent the matter internationally, it would not only amount to interference in the ongoing investigation, which was already proceeding under MLA agreement, but would also encroach upon the domain of foreign policy.
“Undoubtedly, matters of foreign relations are best handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) and the federal government, who are better equipped to determine what serves the purposes of Article 40 and what is appropriate in the international context,” the judgment said.
It said that Article 40 provided that the state shall “foster goodwill and friendly relations among all nations”.
The judgment said that the court had also perused the Feb 13, 2023 order by the Supreme Court, in which it had concurred with the submission of Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman that steps under the MLA were underway and that diplomatic channels were being actively pursued.
It said that the SC had also observed that, in such circumstances, directly approaching international forums would not be the appropriate course of action.
“The Supreme Court accepted this submission, while clarifying that, should the need subsequently arise, recourse to such forums could be considered. Similarly, at this stage, we would leave this issue to the good sense of the federal government,” the judgment said.
The judgment also noted that several “pertinent and significant” steps had been taken by the federal government in the case.
“These include the signing of the MLA, telephonic conversation between the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Kenya, the formation of the special joint investigation team and the investigation carried out by it, diplomatic contacts with the Kenyan authorities by the MoFA, and issuance of black warrants,” it said.
It further noted that remedies were also being pursued at the individual level by Sharif’s family, which were pending before the Kenyan Supreme Court.
The judgment noted that the attorney general had submitted that a formal request to visit Kenya had been made to the concerned Kenyan authorities and that Pakistan was presently awaiting their response.
Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple cases of sedition were registered against him in different cities.
On Jan 14, the FCC had dropped hints about closing the suo motu proceedings, observing that the court’s facilitation had already borne fruit with the signing of a MLA agreement between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year.
Last week, one of the widows of the slain journalist had pleaded before the FCC through a letter not to close the suo motu proceedings.</p><small>2026-02-03 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0321565515dce96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970839/organiser-of-political-moot-at-karachi-press-club-says-participants-detained-police-deny-arrests' target='_blank'><strong>Organiser of political moot at Karachi Press Club says participants detained; police deny arrests</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Eight leaders and workers from different left-wing political parties were detained outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC), reportedly to prevent them from attending a multi-party conference called by the Popular Left Alliance (PLA), according to organisers. However, police denied the claim.
Imdad Qazi, the secretary general of the Communist Party of Pakistan and the convenor of the PLA, told Dawn that the 10-party alliance had called the moot to debate democracy and authoritarianism in Pakistan. However, police contingents were already deployed in the area, he said.
“Five veteran political workers, namely Husain Fatimi, Dr Hasan Nasir, Ramzam Memon, Shaheena, Mohammed Farooq and three other activists were apprehended by the police outside the KPC, to prevent them from attending the conference,” Qazi alleged.
Meanwhile, South Senior Superintendent of Police Mahzoor Ali denied the claim that arrests were made outside the KPC.
In a statement, the PLA said, “Complete authoritarian rule has been imposed in the country. This time, this authoritarianism has been enforced through so-called democratic institutions.”
It added that during the conference, police cordoned off the KPC as the majority of the participants were arrested right at the entrance, which was strongly condemned.
Meanwhile, it said that the moot expressed “serious concerns” over the situation in Balochistan and called for resolving the Balochistan problem through “political and democratic means and in accordance with the wishes of the people of Balochistan”.
According to the statement, the conference also demanded the revocation of all changes made to the Constitution in the last five years, particularly the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, and the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments.
The participants also demanded the release of all “arrested and convicted political prisoners”, including Iman Mazari-Hazir, Hadi Ali Chattha, Mahrang Baloch and others.
The moot also expressed solidarity with all families affected in the Gul Plaza fire and demanded “strict punishment for those responsible for these tragic incidents and called on the government to ensure all necessary safety measures to prevent such occurrences in the future”.
The participants further expressed serious concern over the “tactics used by the institutions” to pressurise press clubs across the country and demanded an immediate end to such harassment.
At the end of the conference, the United States’ raid on Venezuela last month and preparations for another act of aggression against Iran were strongly condemned. It urged the government to take a clear stand against this “open aggression”.</p><small>2026-02-03 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031842227ae12be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970831/achakzai-seeks-pm-shehbazs-intervention-for-imrans-medical-examination-by-trusted-doctors' target='_blank'><strong>Achakzai seeks PM Shehbaz’s intervention for Imran’s medical examination by ‘trusted’ doctors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mahmood Khan Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking his “personal intervention” for the medical examination of PTI founder Imran Khan by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
The letter was shared by the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X.
In the letter, Achakzai said, “I am writing with utmost urgency to bring to your immediate attention a serious matter concerning the health of former prime minister and PTI Chairman, Mr Imran Khan, who is currently detained at Adiala jail, Rawalpindi.”
He went on to say that it had come to his attention that recent medical check-ups were conducted “without the knowledge or presence of his personal medical team or family members”.
“His personal doctors, who are fully aware of his medical history, were not informed,” Achakzai said.







“A full medical examination and tests by his trusted doctors is critically needed without any delay to properly assess and manage his health, in line with medical ethics, legal obligations, and fundamental human rights,” he said.
He also listed the names of Imran’s personal doctors, saying that it would be better if they performed the medical examination. Dr Muhammad Aasim Yusuf, Dr Prof Mazhar Ishaq, and Dr Prof Aamir Awan were the three named in the letter.
“Your immediate personal intervention to ensure this medical access is needed so that the health and well-being of the former prime minister is safeguarded,” he said.
Separately, PTI’s Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking to the media, said that a meeting between Bushra Bibi and Imran was held, after which the former said that the latter was feeling much better.
His remarks came as Bushra Bibi’s family was allowed to meet her for half-an-hour at Adiala jail. While leaving the venue, the family met Gohar and conveyed Bushra Bibi’s remarks about Imran’s health.
Speaking to the media outside the jail, Gohar said that despite the message from Bushra Bibi’s family, it was still necessary to allow a meeting between Imran and his family, and to also allow Imran’s physicians to examine him.
He said that a meeting with Imran had not been allowed since December, adding that the meeting with Bushra Bibi was allowed after three months.
Gohar said that he was told that Imran was informed his eye would be damaged and he should visit Pims.
Days after reports regarding the treatment Imran emerged in mainstream media, the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” he said in a video statement.
It is worth mentioning that the PTI had condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.</p><small>2026-02-03 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03201053e43a0a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970836/china-condemns-balochistan-attacks-says-it-will-always-support-pakistan-in-combatting-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>China condemns Balochistan attacks, says it will always support Pakistan in combatting terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism.
Jian made these remarks during a regular press briefing when he was asked to comment on a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan last week.
Jian said that China strongly condemned the attacks.
“We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
“China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added.
On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”.
In a post on X, the embassy said “we […] deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”.







Apart from China, the US, European Union, Iran and several other countries have also condemned the attacks.
As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives.
It said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
According to reports, the assailants targeted police stations in Quetta’s Sariab area, torched records and killed officers who resisted the attacks. They also raided banks in the Hazarganji area and opened indiscriminate fire before dispersing into different localities of Sariab.
In Kharan, armed men attacked the residence of the Mullazai Qaumi Etihad chairman, killing him and his six security guards. Senior police officer Abdul Baqi said the attackers fled the area after the assault.
In the Tump area of Kech district, armed men shot dead former tehsildar Abid after he resisted an attempted kidnapping.
Sources said armed men also attacked Mastung, burning the police station and breaking into the district jail, freeing 30 prisoners. They also targeted banks and government institutions.
Similar attacks occurred in Kalat, where terrorists attacked banks and police stations, injuring three police personnel and setting banks ablaze. Government offices were also attacked.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the attacks. Speaking on Saturday night, he said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.</p><small>2026-02-03 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03150135eb08965.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970818/pakistan-invited-to-participate-in-upcoming-us-iran-talks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan invited to participate in upcoming US-Iran talks: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington, the Foreign Office (FO) confirmed on Tuesday.
“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query.
“Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn.
The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting.

 

The meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US outlet Axios cited two unnamed sources and a US official as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters, adding that some regional powers were also invited.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday and that it was important to start dialogue between the parties to avoid further escalation.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he has instructed FM Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” provided that an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.

 

The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said in a series of posts on X.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”
He added, “In return, we expect sanctions lifting.”
However, Araghchi said Tehran was ready for war if talks fail and warned that a conflict would likely spiral beyond Iran, CNN added.
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with FM Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has also said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031856359ab6dad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970832/pm-shehbaz-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-fostering-friendly-ties-with-libya' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly ties with Libya</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly relations with Libya, state-broadcaster PTV reported.
The development came as a high-level delegation from Libya called on PM Shehbaz at the Prime Minister’s House, PTV said in a post on X.
It said that the delegation comprised Libyan Prime Minister Dr Osama Saad Hamad, Libyan Arab Armed Forces Commander-in-chief Field Marshal Khalifa Abu-al-Qasim Haftar and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar.
It said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir were also present during the meeting.







“During the discussions, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest and underscored the importance of strengthening bilateral relations,” PTV said.
“The meeting reflected the shared desire to enhance cooperation in areas of common concern and to promote peace, stability, and development at regional and international levels,” PTV reported.
During the meeting, the premier “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering friendly relations with Libya and emphasised the importance of continued engagement and dialogue”.
It added that the Libyan leadership appreciated Pakistan’s role and expressed interest in expanding collaboration between the two countries.
“The meeting concluded with an understanding to maintain close contact and explore avenues for future cooperation,” PTV added.
A day earlier, weeks after signing a more than $4 billion arms deal, Pakistan’s armed forces and Libya’s eastern military had pledged to continue their engagement and collaboration.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03170511f26f185.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970829/basant-set-to-make-its-grand-return-in-lahore-under-mostly-clear-skies' target='_blank'><strong>Basant set to make its grand return in Lahore under mostly clear skies</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival, which is set to be celebrated in Lahore this week.
“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said in a forecast posted on the social media platform X.
It added that light westerly/north-westerly winds were likely to blow at the speed of 10 to 15 kilometres per hour, which was “suitable for safe kite-flying”.
The PMD advised the festival participants to “exercise caution while flying kites, especially near electric lines and open roads”.







The three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a “provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday”.
Owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of kite-related commodities, the Punjab government on Monday approved the manufacture of only “permissible kite-flying material” in four more districts of the province.

 

According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying during Basant, whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
The festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
‘No better occasion to portray Pakistan’s positive image’
CM Maryam visited a Safe City office in Lahore on Tuesday, which she said was being used as Basant control room.
“All the street activities are being monitored from here through drone surveillance,” she said in a televised address.
The chief minister said that Basant was a festivity that was “exclusive to Punjab and we have witnessed how passionately people used to celebrate it”.
“But, due to some unfortunate incidents, the people of Punjab were deprived of it,” she expressed regret.
She further stated that it was unfortunate that “we adopt other cultures”.
“Punjab has a very rich culture and Punjabi, Saraiki, and Potohari are beautiful languages.”
But, the CM continued, “our children have been taught that if they speak English, they will be considered uncultured”.
“We want people to own Punjab, its language and culture,” she added. “Residents of Punjab should protect their culture and language as their historical heritage and take pride in it.”
The Punjab CM said that “our Sikh brothers from Indian Punjab and their children speak Punjabi with pride in all over the world ,whether it is US, Canada, UK or any other country”.
“I urge our Punjabi brothers and sisters to teach Punjabi to their children along with Urdu and English,” she said, adding that “it (Punjabi) is their pride, not a source of embarrassment.”
The chief minister said when her government announced the lifting of ban on Basant, she had little idea about the enthusiasm and Basant “fever” being witnessed among people presently.
People from cities other than Lahore were also making appeals to organise Basant in their cities, she said, adding, “We are organising Basant as a pilot project in Lahore, so that we can see how effective our security protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are.”
The Punjab CM further stated, “We cannot get a better occasion than this to portray Pakistan’s progressive image to the world.”
Maryam said Basant had “generated economic activity worth billions [of rupees]”.
“People from around the world are coming to Punjab. All the hotels and guest houses are booked,” she stated.
The Punjab CM said the tradition of Basant went back to 1250, and the festival marked arrival of spring.
“It’s colour is yellow , as yellow symbolises life returning to land. This is life returning to Punjab,” she remarked.
Outlining the rules and regulations notified by the Punjab government for Basant, she warned that strict SOPs and security protocols were being enforced and violators could face punishment.
“We are going to celebrate Basant from Feb 6 to 8, not a day before Feb 6 nor the day after Feb 8.
“No kites or threads exceeding the permissible size will be allowed, and the violations may lead punishment for up to 10 years and 2 million in fines,” she said.
Maryam said that all kite-flying material that imported from outside Lahore was being strictly monitored.
The CM said information regarding registered manufacturers and sellers of kite-flying material was available at online portal www.basant.punjab.gov.pk.
Moreover, 46 monitoring and implementation camps were established in the high-risk areas, 32 in medium-risk areas and 20 in low-risk zones, she added.
“Over 2500 traffic and 100,00 police personnel have been deployed for the safety of people”, the CM said.
She added that all the entrances of Lahore city were being monitored to prevent the transportation of any non-permissible kite-flying material.</p><small>2026-02-03 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131703d407f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970806/na-adopts-resolution-calling-for-aggressive-national-response-against-terrorisms-sponsors-facilitators' target='_blank'><strong>NA adopts resolution calling for ‘aggressive’ national response against terrorism’s sponsors, facilitators</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism.
The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.”
The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”.







The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”.
It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”.
The resolution also expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values.
It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”.
Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”.
The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday.
The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday.
Lawmakers sound alarm
Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI, the PPP and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province.
During some opposition speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel.
Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai suggested an addition in a resolution that would “recommend that the first right of the children of a province be acknowledged on their respective province’s resources”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq remarked that this was a “constitutionally protected” matter.



In his speech, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently.
“If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said.
Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.”
He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.”
The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added.
“When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute.



The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute.
According to a clip uploaded by the NA, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq objected to certain remarks by Qaiser about the judiciary and expunged them.
Echoing the KP government’s stance, Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it.
He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz.
“The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied. On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said.

 

Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul… then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?”
The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it.
“All our trade, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation of the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism.
“Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies.
Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations, have now signed a trade deal, Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”.
“We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said.
JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district.

 

She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered.
“Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously.
She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister, women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”.
“For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan.



Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been “on fire” for the past 48 hours.
“We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said.
“Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked.
“Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted.







Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”.
He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor.
“Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised.
Speaking after Chaudhry tabled the resolution, PTI’s Noor Alam Khan highlighted the rise in terrorist incidents in KP, pointing out that even school and college buildings were targeted.
“Whoever is doing terrorism in Pakistan cannot be a patriot,” he said.
The PTI lawmaker requested that the terrorism concerns of KP also be incorporated in the resolution as “terrorism is the highest there”.
“Our women, sisters and daughters are unable to study there. Please [add] this in the resolution,” he said.
PPP MNA Sehar Kamran emphasised that the Balochistan attacks could not be seen in isolation, noting there was a “nexus” between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and India.
“The aim was not just to target Balochistan, but to target Pakistan,” she said, adding that those responsible for “external interference” wanted to create instability in the province and weaken the country.
Sehar backed Alam’s opinion that KP was also adversely impacted by terrorism.
“To attack nine to 12 places in a coordinated manner requires tactical and logistic support. I think it is clear that there is external involvement,” the PPP MNA said, stressing the need for national unity to combat it.
During his speech, Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia pointed out that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed.
He noted that Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had made “correct” statements about the deprivation of Sui-supplied gas faced by the people of Balochistan.
A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan.
In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed.
Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity.
‘Province being provided significant financial support’
State Minister for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said Balochistan receives more than 40 per cent higher share than Punjab under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, stressing that the province is being provided significant financial and development support by the federation.
Addressing the house, Chaudhry stated that under the NFC formula, Balochistan receives more than double the per capita funds compared to Punjab and Sindh.
The state minister said 91pc of the “financial resources spent in Balochistan are provided by the federal government”.



Chuadhry further noted that the province has seen major infrastructural and institutional development.
“Balochistan currently has 13 cadet colleges, 321 technical education institutions, and airports even in cities with populations of around 200,000.
“Balochistan has 13 major hospitals, 757 basic health centres, and more than 25,000 kilometres of roads,” he added.
Chaudhry questioned the targeting of public institutions, asking why attacks are carried out on schools and hospitals if the struggle is truly for rights. He emphasised that such acts “harm” ordinary citizens rather than addressing grievances.
“Blocking highways, exploding bridges, and hijacking trains? What is the motive behind it, as common people use them?” he questioned. The interior official asserted that terrorists have no linguistic or religious affiliation.
“TTP is using the beard (religion), and BLA is running their narrative upon Baloch identity; however, they have nothing to do with either of them.”
Responding to the question of why sporting events were being held in the country despite terrorist attacks, he said, “That’s what terrorists want.”
“Terrorists want to tell the world that by halting the business, trade, markets, and sporting events, they have paralysed us. We will not let this happen.”
Chaudhry also criticised New Delhi, saying that despite condemnations from all over the world of the Balochistan attacks, “only India” refrained from it.
He added that security forces were playing their part in the fight against terrorism, and the political leadership had to back them with a joint narrative.
Balochistan attacks
The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province.
According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response.

The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred.
The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan.
The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03170504b8554ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970828/tree-cutting-drive-in-islamabad-conducted-on-orders-from-pm-office-ihc-told' target='_blank'><strong>Tree-cutting drive in Islamabad conducted on orders from PM Office, IHC told</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday that its recent tree-cutting drive in the capital was conducted on the direct instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The statement was part of a written report submitted to the court in response to a petition challenging the CDA’s tree-cutting drive, which had drawn significant public criticism.
Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in Islamabad, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian, drawing criticism alleging large-scale environmental damage. However, authorities have maintained that only Paper Mulberry trees were cut down as they were a major cause of allergies.
In its submission, the CDA defended the campaign as a “well-planned operation” aimed at removing Paper Mulberry trees, which it described as a major source of pollen allergies and asthma in Islamabad.
The authority cited scientific research, including a study published in the Journal of Global Health, linking Paper Mulberry pollen to increased asthma attacks and hospital visits.

 

The authority further claimed that the tree species deteriorated air quality and soil health. The CDA stated that the decision to remove the trees followed a multi-step process: a 2022 order from the IHC led to the formation of an Environment Committee, which recommended the trees’ removal in May 2023.
A public hearing was later held in July 2023, it said.
According to the CDA report, the issue gained attention after a journalist’s column in November 2024, prompting the PMO to direct the Ministry of Health and CDA to take action.
Subsequent meetings resulted in the PMO issuing formal directions to implement a pollen allergy management plan, the authority said.
The CDA denied allegations that it cut down trees other than Paper Mulberry, or that the drive was a cover for development projects.

 

It stated that trees for projects like the ‘Marka-i-Haq Monument’ were transplanted to other locations. The authority also argued that no separate environmental approval was needed because the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK-EPA) was part of the committee that recommended the action.
The CDA has asked the court to dismiss the petition, calling it “without merit”.
It is worth mentioning that environmental conservation organisation WWF-Pakistan, in a statement, had disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed due to a rise in pollen allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development.
“WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body had said.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:37</small></div><hr>
