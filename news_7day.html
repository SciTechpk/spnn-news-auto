The 37-year-old, who made his Test debut in 2010, last played for India in the 2023 World Test Championship final but has been active in domestic cricket as well as county cricket in England.
“Wearing the Indian jersey, singing the anthem, and trying my best each time I stepped on the field — it’s impossible to put into words what it truly meant,” Pujara wrote on his social media pages.
 






“But as they say, all good things must come to an end, and with immense gratitude I have decided to retire from all forms of Indian cricket.
“Thank you for all the love and support!”
He joins former India captains Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and spinner Ravichandran Ashwin from the same generation to quit Test cricket within the past year.
Pujara scored 7,195 runs, including 19 hundreds, from 103 Tests, averaging 43.60.
Pujara also played five one-day internationals but his solid defence and a remarkable ability to play marathon knocks made him an asset in Test cricket.
 
 

He demonstrated those skills most notably in 2018-19 when India registered their maiden Test series victory in Australia with player-of-the-series Pujara amassing 521 runs in seven innings.
Pujara batted a combined 11 hours in the opening Test in Adelaide, scoring 123 and 71 as India won the series opener.
Former India captain Anil Kumble led tributes to Pujara.
“Congratulations on a fantastic career! You have been a great ambassador of this wonderful game,” Kumble, who also coached an Indian side featuring Pujara, wrote on X.
“We are all proud of all your achievements on the cricket field. You gave it your all for the team! It was a privilege to have worked with you and may you continue to shine in your second innings.”

Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued an advisory, forecasting widespread rains in the province from August 22 to 26.
DI Khan Rescue 1122 spokesperson, in a statement, said that “torrential rains claimed the lives of eight people in DI Khan last night,” while 48 people were injured in roof collapse incidents across the city, as per a PDMA report.
According to the Rescue 1122 statement, “heavy rains and strong winds caused widespread infrastructure damage as multiple incidents of damage to trees, walls, and solar panels were reported.”
Rescue 1122 teams were “actively engaged in rescue operations in the affected areas”, said the statement, as all the injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals.
Rescue teams were working to clear out debris from the damage caused by the heavy deluge, the statement added.
Detailing rescue efforts, the District Emergency Officer Engineer Fasihullah said, “Our top priority is the protection of citizens, and we are utilising every available resource in the rescue operation”.
KP death toll since August 15 rises to 406
According to the latest data issued by KP PDMA, last night’s rains in DI Khan have taken the province’s rain-related death toll since August 15 to 406, which includes 305 men, 55 women and 46 children.
The PDMA report said that 247 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, out of which 175 are men, 38 women, and 30 children.
Since August 15, a total of 3,526 houses have been damaged due to rains and flash floods. The number of people displaced in the hard-hit Buner district stands at 337, while 46 people were displaced in Swabi.
 
 

PDMA spokesperson has advised the public to contact the authority’s helpline at 1700 in case of any emergency or weather updates.
PDMA’s emergency operation centre remains fully functional, the spokesperson added.
On Friday, the Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a red alert, urging provincial and district administrations to brace for pot­­ential flooding as a fresh monsoon spell has been forecasted to lash the country from Aug 23 to 29.
According to NDMA data, at least 788 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-24 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/241133399c83faa.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/dar-engages-with-bangladeshs-commerce-foreign-advisers-during-historic-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Dar engages with Bangladesh’s commerce, foreign advisers during historic visit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday met with Bangladesh’s commerce and foreign advisers during his historic visit to Dhaka as the two countries eye to intensify cooperation by building on the reset in ties.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
The Foreign Office has termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
Today, Dar and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan had a breakfast meeting with Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, who was accompanied by various finance and trade officials, the Foreign Office (FO) said on X.
“The two sides discussed ways to promote economic and commercial cooperation, with a special focus on enhancing trade and promoting connectivity,” the post said.
 
 

Bangladesh Investment Development Authority Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Ahsan H. Mansur, National Board of Revenue Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan and Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission Chairman Moinul Khan joined the meeting as well.
Other officials attending the gathering were textile ministry secretary Md Abdur Rauf, tourism ministry secretary Nasreen Jahan, Ministry of Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh Chairman Brigadier Gen Mohammad Faisal Azad and High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan, according to the FO.
 






Dar then held wide-ranging talks with Bangladesh Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain, where both sides reviewed the “entire gamut of bilateral relations”.
Matters discussed included “high-level exchanges, trade and economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts, cultural exchanges, cooperation on education and capacity building, and humanitarian issues”.
Regional and international issues, including rejuvenation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) and resolution of Palestine and the Rohingya issues, were also discussed.
“The talks took place in a constructive atmosphere, reflecting the existing goodwill and cordiality between [the] two countries. Both sides agreed to work for further strengthening of bilateral relations,” the FO noted.
The foreign adviser also hosted a lunch in Dar’s honour.
 






According to a press release by the FO, Dar will also meet Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus later today.
The visit is expected to see the signing of four to five memorandums of understanding to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, culture, media, training, and travel, a senior official of Bangladesh’s foreign ministry told Bangladeshi news outlet BSS.
Last night, Dar and Kamal attended a reception hosted by Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider.
In his remarks at the reception, the foreign minister underscored that the people of Pakistan had fraternal sentiments towards the people of Bangladesh, the FO said on X.
 






“He noted that the relations between the two countries were anchored in centuries-old shared traditions, Islamic heritage, social norms and literary expressions.”
Wishing the people of Bangladesh a harmonious and prosperous future, Dar expressed Pakistan’s “strong desire to forge a cooperative and forward-looking relationship with Bangladesh”.
The deputy PM interacted with personalities from “different walks of life, including advisers of the Bangladeshi government, bureaucrats, leadership of political parties, vice chancellors, members of intelligentsia and think tanks, sportsmen, artists, journalists, retired generals, and others”, the FO added.
Beginning his two-day visit yesterday, Dar met with the delegations of Bangladesh’s three political parties — National Citizens Party (NCP), Jamaat-i-Islami and Bangladesh Nationalist Party.</p><small>2025-08-24 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2410463727b079e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936321/islamabad-ssp-traffic-removed-after-presidents-motorcade-strays-from-vvip-route' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad SSP traffic removed after president’s motorcade strays from VVIP route</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The senior superintendent of Islamabad Traffic Police, also holding the charge of the SSP security, was removed from both the posts for poor supervision and management after President Asif Ali Zardari’s motorcade strayed from the VVIP route in the capital.
Police officers told Dawn that retired Capt Syed Zeeshan Haider, a grade 18 police officer, had put the president and his motorcade at a grave security risk.
The officers said that on Thursday evening, President Zardari was scheduled to visit a family in Bahria Town.
He, accompanied by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and others, moved to Bahria Town from the Presidency. The VVIP motorcade strayed at the Expressway after crossing Koral Chowk even though security measures and VVIP route were put in place. Instead of taking a turn towards Bahria Town, the motorcade moved further beyond the security cordon and the VVIP route.
As a result, the VVIP motorcade was stuck in traffic for over half an hour, they added.
The interior minister and the related security agencies showed serious concern over the poor supervision and management regarding the VVIP route and security.
In response, Mr Haider was removed from both offices and sent to the Central Police Office Islamabad till further orders.
Retired Sqn-Ldr Abdul Haque, a grade-19 officer, was given the additional charge of the SSP security, while Pari Gul Tareen, a grade-18 officer, was given the additional charge of SSP traffic police.

Meanwhile, 59 dengue patients have been reported in Rawalpindi district so far this year.
This year, dengue cases in Murree have been reported from Ghel and Paghwari union councils and the numbers are still rising.
In the Rawalpindi division, 62 cases have been confirmed in Murree, 59 in Rawalpindi, one in Jhelum, four in Chakwal and five in Attock.

Majority of the cases in Murree have been reported from Ghel and Paghwari union councils

A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that dengue surveillance in Murree had not been conducted earlier due to a shortage of staff. Surveillance began only after the virus started spreading. He said the Rawalpindi District Health Authority was managing health affairs in Murree despite it being declared a separate district.
 
 

He added that once dengue cases were detected, the Murree district administration launched a drive to control the virus. Around 300 workers were deployed in Murree after the virus spread in two main union councils.
Deputy Commissioner Murree Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that the district administration had launched an anti-dengue campaign to prevent further spread of the virus and protect residents.
He said teams had been deployed to carry out fogging and that 441 workers from different departments were trained and assigned for fogging and surveillance.
“We obtained necessary supplies from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, including 1,300 nets, 10,000 bottles of anti-mosquito lotion, IRS machines and other items,” he added.
“Section 144 has been imposed along streams and junkyards, and due to this, the number of patients is declining with each passing day. We expect the flow of patients to end by mid-September or October as temperatures fall further,” he said.
On the other hand, Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said an anti-dengue campaign had been launched, supervised by parliamentarians and assistant commissioners.
He said rainfall had created problems for the campaign, but stressed that the work must be completed to protect people from the virus. He added that the provincial government had provided all necessary resources, and it was the duty of officials to carry out their responsibilities.
He said monitoring of all graveyards and junkyards had started, and parliamentarians would inspect and report shortcomings in the campaign. Strict action, he added, would be taken against negligence.
Meanwhile, the Attock district has reported a total of five confirmed dengue cases to date.
The cases are spread across several tehsils, with Hassanabdal registering one (UC Burhan), Fatehjang one (urban area), Pindigheb two, including one imported (UC Ikhlas and UC Kamrial) and Attock city one (urban area).
Despite the confirmed cases, authorities emphasised that all infections were sporadic, with no clusters detected, and that swift case-response protocols had been activated.
Alongside immediate patient care, extensive anti-dengue operations—including surveillance and larva control—are underway across the district to prevent further spread.
When contacted, Chief Executive District Health Authority Dr Asad Ismail said all confirmed patients had been treated according to standard operating procedures and that comprehensive vector control operations had been launched.
“Our teams are visiting high-risk areas daily. Larvicidal activities and awareness campaigns are ongoing, and public cooperation is essential to keep the situation under control,” he added.
Responding to a question, he said that in line with provincial strategies, Attock’s health authorities were employing intensive surveillance, rapid response teams, larval elimination drives, public awareness campaigns, and inter-departmental coordination to curb the disease.
He said the district health office was liaising with education and local bodies to ensure clean water storage, schoolyard inspections, and vector-free environments, especially ahead of the monsoon period.
Meanwhile, residents in Pindigheb and Attock city expressed concern over stagnant water in open plots and under-construction areas. “We appreciate the government’s efforts, but stricter action is needed to remove breeding sites permanently,” said Muhammad Riaz, a shopkeeper in UC Kamrial.
While dengue activity in Attock remains relatively contained this year, Punjab in previous years has experienced far more severe outbreaks.

As he prepares to move into the cage on Sunday at the Pakistan Open MMA Championship, the undefeated lightweight fighter isn’t just predicting a win; rather he is forecasting a swift and decisive conclusion to his bout against Egypt’s Adham “Warrior” Mohamed.
“It will, hopefully, be a knockout finish,” Rizwan told Dawn, a prediction backed by the momentum of two back-to-back knockout wins that have solidified his status as one of Pakistan’s top mixed martial artists.
Speaking on his upcoming clash, Rizwan framed it as a classic striker versus grappler match-up.
He acknowledged the contrasting styles each man brings to the cage. While Adham boasts a record of 11 wins and four losses and carries a reputation for his grappling strength, Rizwan believes his own striking prowess will be the difference-maker.
“We both have contrasting styles as my opponent struggles in striking while I lack a bit in my wrestling; so it will be a good fight,” he said, anticipating a compelling battle for the fans.
But for the 26-year-old phenom known as “The Haider,” this fight is more than just another notch on his perfect 9-0 record; it is another step towards a much bigger journey.
Hailing from the small city of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi District, Rizwan’s ambition burns far brighter than mere local acclaim. He has set his sights on a goal no Pakistan fighter has ever achieved: to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
“There is no Pakistani in the UFC, world’s most famous league, and I want to be the first and [I am] working for it as hard as I can,” Rizwan emphasised.
Yet, he is acutely aware of the systemic challenges that have held Pakistan fighters back. He noted that the reason no one has reached the UFC yet is a matter of development, not desire.
“We don’t have the skills to compete there,” he explained candidly. “MMA as a sport is still in its early stages in Pakistan, so we don’t have coaches who can train us to reach that level.”
This stark reality fuels his urgency for support. Rizwan emphasised that for Pakistan athletes to compete on the world stage, they need significant investment.
“We need big sponsors so that we can afford to train with better foreign coaches,” he said, adding with sobering honesty, “otherwise there’s no chance.”
His recent triumphs have carried an extra layer of motivation, particularly his stunning streak of knocking out three Indian opponents in his last three fights. For Rizwan, these victories were personal, fuelled by a familiar national narrative he was determined to rewrite.
“I had an extra motivation as we most of the time lose to India in cricket so I just badly wanted to win no matter what it took,” he expressed.
Beyond the gloves, the wraps, and the fierce rivalries, Rizwan also shed light on the less glamorous, but critical, aspect of a fighter’s life: discipline. He spoke on the immense importance of diet, both during fight week and in his daily routine.
“You have to focus on every nutritional aspect to stay fit,” Rizwan said. “You need to have a strict diet and eat clean and healthy as when you’re not fighting you gain weight pretty quickly and cutting it during the fight week could become very difficult.”
As Sunday approaches, Rizwan stands ready – a symbol of Pakistan’s raw, untapped potential in MMA.
He carries the hopes of a nation yet to be represented on the sport’s grandest stage and the quiet confidence of a man who believes his hand will be raised, his mission advanced and his knockout prediction fulfilled.

• GB survivors face shortage of essentials; over 3,000 displaced in Ghizer; Glof-II project probe demanded
LAHORE: A day before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell, the Punjab government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
The Provincial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA) initiated evacuations and emergency operations across multiple districts amid a new and intense monsoon spell forecast on August 24-27. According to a hydrological report by the Board of Revenue, the situation at Ganda Singh Wala was critical and expected to persist for the next 48 hours.
 
 

In response, district administrations in central and southern Punjab were racing against time to relocate communities living along the riverbanks. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that over 19,000 people were evacuated from multiple flood-affected areas of the province.
He said a high alert had been issued for the districts of Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, and Vehari. He said that the evacuation and transportation of 19,947 people from areas adjacent to the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum rivers had been completed.
“The evacuation of populations settled in the riverbeds of the Sutlej and Ravi is our utmost priority. All resources are being employed for the protection of citizens,” stated Khawaja Salman Rafique, provincial minister and chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Disaster Management, following an emergency meeting at the PDMA headquarters.
 


‘Mixed picture’
The river situation across Punjab showed a mixed picture as the Indus River at Tarbela and Kalabagh was rising. The Chenab and Ravi river systems were stable and within normal bounds at all major gauges. The hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan, though normal at the time, were also being closely monitored.
The epicentre of the crisis remains Sutlej, where authorities were focusing evacuation efforts in areas like Jalalpur Pirwala. “We have begun relocating residents to prevent any potential damage. Their lives and property are our primary concern,” said Multan’s Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu.
The urgency of these operations is compounded by a fresh weather warning. The Paki­stan Meteorological Depart­ment has forecast an “eighth spell” of monsoon rains from August 24 to 27, expected to bring torrential rains to the upper regions of Punjab and other parts of the country.
Punjab Relief Commis­sioner Nabil Javaid said rescue teams had been pre-deployed to sensitive locations and that relief camps were fully operational. “These camps are equipped with all basic facilities, including medicines and vaccines. We are ensuring announcements are made in mosques and at the local level to guide people to safety,” said PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia.
 
 

The provincial government urged citizens to cooperate fully with rescue agencies, avoid all recreational activities near water bodies, and immediately contact the PDMA helpline 1129 in case of an emergency.
With the new monsoon spell looming, the next 96 hours are critical for Punjab as it takes measures to relocate thousands of people living along the rivers.
GB survivors struggle
Meanwhile, the rain spell is also expected to bring heavy rain and flash floods to Gilgit-Baltistan — a region already reeling from successive floods over the past few weeks. A day earlier, a glacial flood in Tal­idas village rendered hundre­ds of people homeless, whe­r­eas the roads, including Shan­dur-Ghizer Road, across the mountainous region rema­in closed after landslides and floods.
Meanwhile, the survivors in the flood-hit areas faced a shortage of water for drinking and irrigation. Israruddin Israr, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan GB coordinator, said 330 households, comprising over 3,000 individuals, had become internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the recent glacial lake outburst flood in Talidas village in Ghizer district.
The number of IDPs in this incident is the second-largest since the 2010 Attabad disaster, he noted.  GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said residents of Talidas had been shifted to a tent settlement.
The GB chief minister also visited the affected area, Mr Faraq said, adding that the CM announced a cash reward for the shepherd who warned about the flood in time.
 
 

The GB government spokesperson said the shepherd will be invited to the Chief Minister’s Secretariat and a ceremony will be held in his honour. He said an alternative village would be established for the Glof-affected residents, and the prime minister would be approached for this initiative. The early warning system was not active in the Ghizer district, he admitted.
Former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman, in a statement, said they had reservations about the Glof-II project for early warning systems, installed by the UNDP across GB for Rs10 billion. He alleged these funds were misused and demanded an investigation into the system’s failure.

These include the January 6, 2021 attack by Donald Trump’s supporters on the Capitol Building in Washington DC; the February 8, 2022 attack on the National Congress Palace and the Supreme Court building in Brazil’s capital Brasília by supporters of Jair Bolsonaro; and the May 9, 2023 attacks on government and military facilities in Pakistan by supporters and leaders of Imran Khan’s party.
Two presidents (Trump and Bolsonaro) had lost re-election bids, and one former prime minister (Khan) had been arrested on corruption charges a year after he was ousted as PM through a no-confidence vote in the parliament. All three lamented that certain political and state elites had conspired to oust them.
After their ouster, they were accused of inciting their supporters to create havoc by striking against the ‘elites’ who had allegedly engineered their exit. Trump managed to dodge his accusers and return to the White House in 2024. But Khan has been in jail for over two years now, serving two prison sentences and facing additional cases.
He’s been barred from contesting elections for at least five years. Bolsonaro is under house arrest and facing a trial in which he can serve a 20 year (or more) prison sentence. He cannot contest an election till 2030.

From Washington DC and Brasília to Islamabad, populist uprisings have been framed as revolts of the people against ‘corrupt elites.’ In truth, these were clashes between rival elites, each cloaking its power struggle in the language of mass resistance

Trump’s survival in this regard — and his somewhat miraculous return to power — was mostly due to the manner in which his opponents understood his defeat in 2020. Despite Trump’s victory in 2016, they continued to comprehend Western democracy as being a self-correcting system that had course-corrected itself when Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020. To them, he was likely to slip into oblivion. They saw Trump’s first term (2016-2020) as a temporary bout of madness within American democracy. This was a naive analysis.
According to social physiologists J.P. Forgas and W.D. Crano, after populists acquire power, the movements that carried them into power may continue unabated, driven mostly by the ‘tribal’ allegiances and moral fervour of their followers.
Populist leaders who manage to get into power are aware of this. That’s why their rhetoric and actions don’t really change even when they become presidents or prime ministers. They want the movements to survive. Seeing themselves as ‘outsiders’, they are never able to feel secure in power. They keep their movements going so they can fall back on them if and when they’re ousted.
 
 

Since the movements that carry the populists to power remain active, they (the movements) become willing conduits of the reactive narratives of the ousted populists. The movements provide the populists foot soldiers for their ‘fight’ against the ‘corrupt elites’ that had ousted them. Trump, Bolsonaro and Khan all believed that the riots that they allegedly triggered would compel nervous state elites to restore them.
However, once the riots were brought under control, the state and the new governments in Brazil and Pakistan became aware of the role populist movements can play even after the core leaders of the movements had fallen. Therefore, in Brazil and Pakistan, such movements began being systematically dismantled, whereas Trump’s movement (‘Make America Great Again’) was allowed to regroup and regenerate itself.
 


All three movements discussed here claimed to be anti-elite. To Trump, the elites were the ‘deep state’, ‘establishmentarian politicians’ and ‘liberals’ (especially in the Democratic Party), and moderates within his own Republican Party. To Bolsonaro, mainstream leftist parties, secularists and the Supreme Court were the ‘evil elites.’ To Khan, ‘corrupt’ mainstream parties, ‘khooni liberals’ [murderous liberals] and, later, some Supreme Court judges and the military, were the detested elites.
In Brazil and Pakistan, those supporting Bolsonaro and Khan saw the February 2022 and May 2023 violence as ‘middle class uprisings’ against ruling elites, whereas in the US, those who were ransacking the Capitol Building believed a ‘people’s revolution’ was underway.
However, in the early 1990s, the American historian Christopher Lasch had explained populism as “the revolt of the elites.” The American anthropologist Arjun Appadurai expanded Lasch’s observation by writing that, if the 20th century was an era of ‘the revolt of the masses’, the 21st century has been the era of the ‘revolt of the elites.’
 
 

Such observations bother populists and their supporters. They like to be identified as the ‘masses’ or at least as a significant part of the masses. They really aren’t — considering that the term masses is usually identified with social and economic segments that are below the upper and the middle classes.
As a term, ‘masses’ was refigured by the middle classes in Europe and the US during the height of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century to mean the millions of people who began thronging urban centres to work in the ever-growing number of factories and lived in cramped conditions (slums). The ‘masses’ were not involved in the populist uprisings discussed here. Those who were at the forefront of the uprisings were what Appadurai calls the “new elite”, which was battling the established elites for political power.
When populists succeed in becoming presidents and prime ministers, an ‘alternative elite’ begins to take shape. It is largely given momentum by those wealthy businesspeople and sections of the middle classes that have developed tense social and political disagreements with other sections of the business and middle classes.
Modern-day populism is a fight between elites. So, during the three uprisings we’ve discussed here, when an alternative elite lost power, its leaders and supporters poured out not to ‘save democracy’, or carry on some noble mission. They rioted to save the power that their section of the elite had managed to grab, but then had lost.

The wheat crop, although harvested in March, came in below expectations, contributing to growing concerns.
Traders warn that wheat consumption in the livestock and poultry sectors has added to the supply pressure, as a significant amount of wheat has been diverted for animal feed. In addition, recent heavy rains, particularly in Karachi and the upcountry, have exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance for vegetables, leading to higher prices at markets.
As per the latest data from the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending Aug 21, the price of a 10kg wheat bag in Karachi has risen to Rs660, up from Rs640 at the start of August. Similarly, the cost of one kilogram of fine flour has increased to Rs95 from Rs93. The 20kg wheat flour bag now costs between Rs1,500 and Rs1,800, compared to Rs1,350 to Rs1,700 earlier this month.
 
 

Rauf Ibrahim, Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), highlighted that the wholesale price of wheat has surged to Rs72 per kg, up from Rs62 in July. When the Sindh wheat crop entered the market in March, it was priced at Rs55-56 per kg. This sharp rise in wheat prices has led to increases in flour prices as well, with wholesale rates for flour No. 2.5 and fine flour climbing from Rs74 and Rs79 per kg to Rs81 and Rs85, respectively.

Wheat consumption in livestock and poultry sectors adds to supply pressure

The trend is not confined to Karachi. Across the country, the national average prices for wheat flour have risen. A 20kg wheat flour bag now costs between Rs1,480 and Rs1,800, while the price for a 10kg wheat bag and one kilogram of fine flour have increased to Rs709 and Rs97.53, respectively.
Ibrahim further noted that retailers are likely to pass on an additional Rs10 per kg to consumers as the wholesale price of wheat rises. Despite the harvests from Sindh and Punjab earlier this year, a wheat crisis is beginning to emerge, with fears of a potential shortage looming.
 
 

It is estimated that between three and four million tonnes of wheat have already been consumed by the livestock sector, out of the 23 million tonnes harvested this year. This consumption, which has increa­sed ahead of Eidul Azha, is expected to continue. This is a sharp deviation from the original estimate of a 27 million tonne harvest, further straining wheat supply.
He criticised both federal and provincial governments for their delayed response to the rising wheat prices, warning that unless action is taken, flour prices could climb to Rs100 per kilogram, affecting the broader population. He called for a ban on the use of wheat in the livestock sector to prevent further shortages and urged the government to stockpile wheat in private and state-run warehouses to avoid a crisis.
Costly vegetables
In addition to wheat, the vegetable market in Karachi has also seen significant price hikes following recent rains. For example, tomato prices have surged to Rs200 per kg, up from Rs100-150 just days earlier, while onions have increased to Rs80 per kg from Rs50-60. Green onions have seen a dramatic increase, now priced at Rs500-600 per kilogram, up from Rs300. Other vegetables, such as bottle gourd and apple gourd, are being sold for Rs150 per kilogram, up from Rs80-100.
 
 

Haji Shajehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market at the New Sabzi Mandi Super Highway, attributed the rise in vegetable prices to supply disruptions caused by the rains. He also noted that some exporters are purchasing good-quality onions for export, further contributing to local price increases. He placed part of the blame on retailers who are overcharging consumers due to reduced supply from Sindh’s producing areas.
In the pulses market, there is a significant gap between wholesale and retail prices. The wholesale price for good quality Mash, Moong, Masoor, and Gram pulses ranges from Rs240 to Rs340 per kilogram, while retailers are charging Rs280-420 for the same products.With these ongoing price increases and the looming threat of further price hikes, consumers are feeling the impact, and many are concerned about the government’s ability to manage the situation.

According to official sources, the water level at Hub Dam rose significantly due to the recent monsoon rains, increasing from 322 feet to 333 feet.
Karachi faces severe water shortages, with a daily requirement of over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD) but currently receiving only around 650 MGD, officials said.
The Hub Dam supplies approximately 100 MGD to the Keamari and West districts, while the remainder is sourced from Keenjhar Lake.

Officials say additional six feet of water is required to reach dam’s maximum capacity of 339 feet

Officials also said that the dam’s maximum capacity is 339 feet and when filled to this level, it can supply water to the West, Keamari and Central districts of the city for up to three years.
When the dam reaches full capacity, excess water is released through a spillway to ensure safe drainage.
It is worth noting that the Hub Dam, completed in 1981, spans an area of 24,300 acres. To date, the dam has reached its full capacity 12 times. Last year, it reached the maximum level on Sept 1, after which the spillway was opened and water was released.
Experts believe that if monsoon rains continue, the dam may reach full capacity again in the coming days.
Officials welcomed the rise in the water level and described it as encouraging news for both the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and the city’s residents.
They added that the increased water reserves will play a crucial role in stabilising and improving Karachi’s water supply system.

Dealers indicated that while remittance inflows remain unaffected, with July witnessing $3.2 billion in transfers, the drop in open market sales could destabilise the exchange rate.
Money changers explained that the strict documentation requirements for dollar purchases are limiting their sales, with only transactions of up to $500 not raising any questions. According to bankers, the open market has sold around $115 million to the banking sector this month, significantly lower than the same period last year.
 
 

“The open market is running low on dollars. They are only selling what they receive from the public, which suggests that someone is purchasing dollars before selling them to money changers,” said a money changer, who requested anonymity.
While sales may rise this year, the money changers estimate that it is unlikely they will exceed $200m in sales for August. By comparison, the average monthly dollar sales by money changers stood at $350m during FY25, while July FY26 saw $300m in sales within the banking market.

Money changers report a 50pc drop in dollar sales this month

Money changers are also expressing concerns over the resurgence of illegal markets in major cities, where exchange rates are not fixed, ranging from Rs287 to Rs292. This has attracted individual sellers, as well as some buyers seeking dollars for tuition fees or medical expenses abroad. Despite the higher rates, it remains challenging to secure dollars for such legitimate needs.
The official dollar exchange rate has been falling against the Pakistani rupee following a crackdown on smugglers and illegal operators. Since the operation began, the dollar has dropped by Rs4 in the open market, from Rs288.50 on July 22 to Rs284.50 currently.
Bankers confirmed that the decline in open market sales is unrelated to government changes in incentives for banks and money changers. They also noted that remittance inflows remained robust in July. However, they pointed out that price controls could be allowing illegal market players to exploit the situation by offering higher rates, which could destabilise the exchange rate.
While the government has made efforts to reduce the dollar’s value, these measures have not had the desired effect. Despite the crackdown, the dollar’s price remains volatile in both the open and inter-bank markets.
Some analysts believe that the market could stabilise with higher foreign exchange reserves, continued remittance inflows, and improved relations with the US and China. They suggested that the State Bank should avoid large-scale dollar purchases, as it did in FY25, to ensure market liquidity and stability.

A bolt of lightning rips through the sky in the desert region. —Dawn

• In past eight years, lightning strikes in desert region have killed over 350 people, thousands of livestock
• Residents demand installation of lightning arresters, protective infrastructure in villages
• Activist alleges CSR funds not being spent by coal companies for protection of locals
• SECMC says Met officials’  research found no scientific link between coal mining and rising number of lightning strikes
MITHI: The desert region of Tharparkar, where rainfall was once celebrated as a blessing, has in recent years turned into a land of fear and tragedy. For generations, the monsoon was welcomed with folk songs, dances, children playing on sand dunes and peacocks spreading their feathers. But now, whenever clouds gather over the arid land, villagers rush indoors, farmers abandon their fields, and whispered prayers ask that the lightning may spare them.
According to official data from the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), more than 350 people have lost their lives in lightning strikes across Tharparkar since 2018, while thousands have been injured. The desert has also seen the death of thousands of livestock, including goats, sheep, cows, buffalo and camels.
Between 2023 and 2025 alone, 60 people were killed, over 50 injured and more than 1,600 animals perished. Officials concede that the actual figures are likely to be much higher, as many incidents in remote pastures and forests are never reported.
The tragedies have been numerous and devastating. Two years ago, six young Hindu devotees walking to the annual Dada Parbrahm fair near Mithi were struck by lightning and died. Last year, an entire family in the village of Akro near Nagarparkar was wiped out in a single strike. And just last week, four more people were killed in Kloi, Modasio and nearby villages, while days earlier a motorcyclist lost his life after being hit on the road in Nagarparkar.
‘Coal projects destabilise Thar’s climate’
Local journalists and activists say such incidents were rare in the past but have risen sharply since 2018–19.
Senior journalist and activist Khatuo Jani told Dawn that the expansion of coal projects has disturbed Thar’s fragile environment.
 
 

“The open-pit mining in Blocks I and II, the heavy chimneys of coal-fired power plants run by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, and the gases they release have polluted the air and destabilised the climate. Lightning incidents were once rare in villages, now they are frequent and deadly. Once rain was joy, now it is pain, fear and even death,” he said.
He added that although the Climate Hit Act of 1958 provides for compensation of Rs200,000 to Rs500,000 for victims, no families in Thar have received support for their losses. He further pointed out that a team from Mehran University had visited the area but avoided examining the mining and power plant sites.
“Both Block I and Block II projects generate billions, yet their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives have failed to address this crisis. Coal royalties and CSR budgets exist, but they are not being spent on protecting communities,” Mr Jani said.
According to him, the Thar Foundation should be using CSR allocations for installing earthing systems, early-warning mechanisms, awareness campaigns and community-level rescue training, but nothing meaningful has been done. “Billions flow into Thar in the name of coal, but the poor remain unprotected while human lives and livestock are lost every monsoon,” he added.
Civil society groups have also raised an alarm. Comrade Nand Lal Malhi, chairman of the Thar Action Forum, said that during the current monsoon alone lightning has struck more than 10 places, killing three people and hundreds of animals. He recalled that in 2023 a conference held in Mithi had urged the Sindh government and environmental authorities to install lightning arresters across Thar’s 2,500 villages.
“Two years have passed and no action has been taken. If such measures had been implemented, we would not be facing losses on this scale today,” he said, urging the provincial government to use coal royalties and CSR funds if budgetary resources were insufficient.
Aijaz Bajir, media coordinator of the Thar Citizen Forum, said that most incidents are occurring around Coal Block II, where mining and power projects release large volumes of gases into the atmosphere.
“The District Council had even written to Mehran University’s vice chancellor requesting research, but no meaningful study has been carried out. Companies working here are earning billions yet have not bothered to investigate this growing disaster,” he said.
Expert calls for installtion of earthing rods
Experts, too, believe climate change is a major factor. Dr Riaz Din, associate professor of Electrical Engineering at NED University, explained that lightning is a common global phenomenon but has intensified in recent years.
“In the United States, some 250 million lightning strikes occur annually, causing around $2 billion in damage. But in Thar, an open desert with little awareness or protection, the consequences are devastating,” he said, stressing that installing earthing rods could greatly reduce casualties and protect livestock.
Civil society organisations have attempted small interventions. Ali Akbar Rahimoon, CEO of Aware Organisation, said his organisation had installed simple earthing rods in ten villages near Chachro.
“Since then, no major damage has occurred in those villages. The current from strikes is diverted safely into the ground. But in areas without such rods, people live in constant fear, farmers abandon their fields and rush home as soon as thunder begins,” he said and urged the Sindh government, PDMA and DDMA to extend the initiative across the desert and introduce modern early-warning systems.
Residents, meanwhile, accuse their lawmakers and local government of indifference. Billions are spent on Annual Development Programme (ADP) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) budgets, but nothing is done to protect them from lightning,” said villagers in Nagarparkar.
They demanded that upcoming budgets allocate resources for lightning arresters in every town and village, so that no more human lives and livestock are lost.
‘No scientific link between coal mining and lightning strikes’
When contacted, Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) and Thar Foundation said in a statement that the meteorological department had conducted research and concluded that there was no scientific link between coal mining in Thar and the rising number of lightning strikes in the desert.
It said officials underscored this position during Sindh Energy Minister Nasir Hussain Shah’s recent visit to Tharparkar, where concerns had been raised by local groups about possible connections between mining activity and extreme weather events.
International studies, including research from China, also suggest that while climate change is intensifying lightning incidents worldwide, no direct correlation has been established with coal mining operations.
“The Thar coal projects contribute to Sindh’s economy through royalty payments made to the provincial government. In addition, the Thar Foundation — established to support the desert region — channels its own CSR funds into programmes aimed at uplifting local communities.
These initiatives include healthcare, education, livelihood generation, women’s empowerment, and other development projects,” the statement concluded.

Yes, the killing fields of Gaza are seeing another weapon — starvation — being deployed, because the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF), under orders from the Netanyahu government, are not content with killing 60,000 people — a figure which its own database says included, in the first phase of the war, 83 per cent unarmed civilians. If the first phase set a trend that continues, then some 50,000 innocent civilians have been killed so far.
The blockade clamped by IOF, also known as IDF (Israeli Defence Forces), has triggered a famine. Malnutrition and death stalk the Strip as the UN says that one in five households, some half a million Gaza Palestinians, are facing an acute food and nutrition deficit, and one in three children or more are acutely malnourished. Similarly, two per 10,000 people are dying daily due to malnutrition and disease. Soul-destroying numbers, you’d agree.
 
 

The web-based +972 Magazine, run by Israeli and Palestinian journalists, has published a story based on the Israeli ministry of intelligence’s database, which says that of those killed by Israel in the first phase, only 17pc are identified as Hamas militants or other combatants. The rest were unarmed civilians. This when Israel was claiming a high ‘kill ratio’ of 50pc to 60pc of militants. The report also says of those killed, 60pc were women and children.
It seems that starvation and killings are not enough to achieve the goal of total and expeditious ethnic-cleansing of Gaza. So, Nobel Peace Prize aspirant US President Donald J. Trump has greenlit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Gaza occupation plan for which a 60,000-strong IOF force has been assembled. Reservists in multiples of that number are being recalled to duty.

There can be no doubt that the apartheid state enjoys unparalleled impunity to kill, maim and forcefully displace Palestinians.

This occupation plan and the UN designation of the situation in Gaza as a famine has stirred the conscience of ‘civilised and democratic’ Europe enough for its leaders to quickly issue perfunctory statements of disapproval — while continuing to supply the apartheid state with advanced weaponry, vital parts and other defence equipment.
There can be no doubt that the apartheid state enjoys unparalleled impunity to kill, maim and forcefully displace Palestinians not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank where settlers backed by IOF personnel have been on the rampage. The story of the Palestinians in Jerusalem is no different.
 
 

And this impunity extends to American soil too. Just Google to see how many Israeli paedophiles have been arrested by joint FBI Police and Homeland Security taskforces and then bailed out and allowed to return home. The story of the latest such incident was broken by independent journalist Shaun King on X.
Tom Alexandrovich was caught this month in a joint taskforce sting targeting paedophiles when he tried to lure a decoy underage girl for sex and used explicit language in his messages to her. A lot of reporting on the issue has been deleted by X but try and search for a video recorded by the Nevada law-enforcement officers where he is seen saying “Sorry, I didn’t mean to do anything”, in a daze, minutes after having been caught. When I checked last, it was there on the handle Ultras_antifaa on X.
While a lot of information is available online, this powerful man, who told law-enforcement officers he was in the US for meetings with the NSA and FBI, had a lot of content taken down by X and also wiped off other internet sites where the matter was being reported.
Why did he have such influence? Well, he heads the department in Israel which is behind the agency’s ‘take down’ requests to, for example, X. He is one of Netanyahu’s top aides and his social media profile says “Executive Director, Israel National Cyber Directorate, Building National Cyber Security, AI for Defence, Threat Intelligence (CTI), Aviation Security”.
King reported that taskforce officers involved in the sting operation and arrest confirmed to him that the “Trump administration personally intervened, at Israel’s request, to override US law enforcement, including their own federal agents involved in the sting, to make sure Alexandrovich got back to Israel quickly and safely”. The officers confirmed that the arrested man did not have a diplomatic visa or any kind of diplomatic immunity.
 
 

Alexandrovich’s department works in close coordination with NSO, the developer of the Pegasus spying software that governments around the world use to snoop on confidential conversations of their own citizens as well as foes. In all likelihood, the department snoops on foreign players and governments. He has also posted about making presentations to Netanyahu on projects to protect his country and undermine the adversaries.
Now imagine if the citizen of any other country was caught while attempting to lure a minor for sex. The US has cancelled the student visas and ruined the lives of a large number of foreign students for merely exercising their freedom to protest peacefully against Israeli atrocities in Gaza. It has also blocked visas to overseas students admitted to US colleges because their social media timelines show them to be critical of Israel.
And in the US, the Nevada state attorney, whose personal social media account (since deleted) had multiple posts supporting Israeli actions and the annihilation of Palestinians and the Clark County district attorney (both US-Israeli dual nationals) played their part in freeing a man charged with a serious offence that carries a jail term of up to 10 years. They happily complied with the Trump administration’s request and freed him on bail.
This story is shared here because you are unlikely to have read it on Western media, the self-proclaimed citadel of free speech. The purpose of sharing this was also to underline the sort of leverage the apartheid state has over the US. The one major consequence is the fate of Palestine and the Palestinians.

However, over time, security considerations have increasingly overshadowed economics, leaving the relationship struggling between the two domains. On the other hand, Pakistan-US relations have historically been strategic and security-centric, but today, they also face the challenge of balancing security with geo-economic priorities.
Ultimately, the real test lies with Pakistan’s establishment — whether it chooses to prioritise geo-economics or maintain deeper, security-centred strategic ties with both global powers. Nevertheless, these options will inevitably come with conditions attached.
 
 

Apparently, China’s foremost concern remains security. At the same time, the US emphasises the economic dimension, framing its engagement as both an opportunity for financial advantage and a means to elevate Pakistan’s political profile, particularly in the context of the changing politics of South and West Asia. Pakistan’s geography is undoubtedly a strategic asset, complemented by its aspiration to project itself at a level comparable, if not equal to, India’s military, strategic and political stature, at least in a sustainable sense.
Two perspectives emerge in this regard. One holds that maintaining strong ties with both China and the US can help Pakistan achieve this status. The other, less popular but arguably more pragmatic, view contends that without ensuring political stability and sustained economic growth at home, such ambitions will remain elusive.

Maintaining an exclusive relationship with both China and the US is a delicate task.

However, maintaining an exclusive relationship with both is delicate, especially when there is a contrast in the approach towards and expectations from each other. The phrase ‘de-securitisation of bilateral relationship between the US and Pakistan’ is echoing in Islamabad. But, it remains unclear whether the two nations, which have maintained close security-related ties for over 75 years, will suddenly shift the paradigm, especially when other avenues for cooperation are limited in scope.
Indeed, Pakistan scored a significant boost when it secured a deal with the US on 19 per cent tariffs, opening the door to the expansion of its exports with reduced competition. For much of the past two decades, however, Pakistan’s trade relationship with Washington has been marked by a structural imbalance; the US imports more from Pakistan than it exports, leaving an annual deficit that has averaged between $2 billion to $3bn.
 
 

Lower tariffs mean Pakistan must recalibrate its trade strategies. On the surface, its recent negotiations for textile concessions and the decision to import, according to reports, a billion dollars’ worth of US crude oil appear to be tactical measures to ease the strain. Similarly, discussions on crypto cooperation and energy resources exploration carry a futuristic tone, holding some potential to generate political capital and sustain bilateral confidence.
Nevertheless, neither country can detach itself from the broader framework of security cooperation, whether in counterterrorism or regional stability. Washington’s decision to designate the Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation Army a foreign terrorist organisation — Islamabad’s long-standing demand — reflects an unusual convergence of interests in this sphere.
Yet, a serious test for Pakistan could arise if Washington, in tandem with Saudi Arabia, presses it to endorse the Abraham Accords. Such a move would almost certainly come with binding conditions, foremost among them a recalibration of Pakistan’s Iran policy. Within this context, Balochistan assumes added significance, not only for its role in regional geopolitics but also for the allure of its untapped rare earth mineral reserves.
Outside these contexts, if the US genuinely seeks to de-hyphenate security from its relationship with Pakistan, the question remains: how can this be achieved while engaging primarily with Pakistan’s defence establishment, which by its very nature prioritises security? Successive civilian governments have attempted to reframe their ties with Washington on non-security grounds.
The last serious effort came under the PPP government after 2008, when, in the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto’s assassination, the party mistakenly thought that it could alter the trajectory of bilateral relations. The attempt backfired. The Kerry-Lugar Bill, which was supposed to broaden cooperation beyond security, instead became a flashpoint, straining US-Pakistan ties and unsettling the civil-military balance at home.
Another perspective available in the geopolitical domain is that the developments of 2025 do not represent a pivot away from India but a diversification of Washington’s approach to South Asia.
For Pakistan, the opportunity is unprecedented: a chance to reduce overreliance on China, broaden its partnerships, and restore a measure of strategic balance. Yet history warns of how often such openings have been squandered by short-term thinking, institutional fragility and shifting global priorities. The test lies not in the signing of agreements but in their consistent implementation.
 
 

If Islamabad can deliver reforms and Washington sustains its commitments, the deal may indeed evolve into a long-term framework of cooperation. If not, it risks becoming just another episode in the long and uneasy history of Pakistan-US relations, full of grand announcements, followed by quiet disappointments.
Pakistan’s establishment does not see any major challenge in balancing its close ties with China while exploring new avenues with the US. It’s also not overly worried about growing China-India ties, knowing their relationship has never been truly strategic and remains uncertain in the near future. Pakistan’s confidence is anchored in its robust defence partnership with China and remains largely intact, even in scenarios where Beijing and New Delhi might coordinate strategies to outmanoeuvre US President Donald Trump.
Chinese diplomacy, however, tends to be far less vocal than Washington’s, and is often conveyed through understated gestures. The Chinese foreign minister’s recent visit to Islamabad centred on security, CPEC and new initiatives. Significantly, just a day earlier, he had been in Kabul for a trilateral security meeting.
Media reports suggest that while China and Afghanistan have advanced discussions on joining the BRI, momentum to extend CPEC into Afghanistan has cooled. The Taliban, meanwhile, appears eager to cultivate an exclusive relationship with Beijing, independent of Pakistani influence, and China has agreed to connect Afghanistan through Central Asia via direct links. This is a signal that Rawalpindi and Islamabad would do well to interpret with care.

The Gilgit-Baltistan Bar Council, GB Supreme Court Bar Association, GB High Court Bar Association and District Bar Associations had jointly given the call for protest.
HCBA Secretary General Advocate Islamuddin told Dawn that lawyers in the region had been protesting for the past 10 months, boycotting court proceedings and holding rallies. They had also blocked the River View Road.
The protesting lawyers said they had been demanding their rights, including the long-delayed induction of judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, the establishment of special courts such as family and consumer courts, advertisement of vacant civil judge posts, and the separation of judicial magistrate from civil judge positions in line with practice elsewhere in the country, with appointments made from the legal fraternity on merit.

The legal fraternity sought judicial reforms, appointments and court expansion

They also demanded financial grants and allotment of plots to GB lawyers, appointments of legal advisers in government and non-government organisations, extension of the Lawyers Protection Act to GB, and separation of the offices of prosecutor general and advocate general.
A delegation of lawyers met GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Friday to discuss the issues. Senior lawyer Asadullah Khan, who led the delegation, said the lawyers also expressed reservations about the appointment of retired judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court.
He said judges elevated from the GB Chief Court to the GB Supreme Appellate Court should not hear cases they had previously adjudicated in the Chief Court. He added that lawyers also demanded the appointment of judges to vacant posts in the GB Supreme Appellate Court from within the legal fraternity on merit.
According to him, the chief minister agreed to send a summary to the prime minister regarding the appointment of lawyers as judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, as well as to the federal government for creating new positions for law officers in GB.
“The GB chief minister also agreed to implement other demands that fall within the GB government’s domain,” said Mazhar Hussain Advocate, president of the Gilgit District Bar. He said that the delay in appointing judges in the GB Supreme Appellate Court, GB Chief Court and lower courts had badly affected the delivery of justice.
He added that GB lawyers’ demands were in the interest of the general public, pointing out that no judges had been appointed to the GB Supreme Appellate Court for the last eight years, leaving thousands of important cases pending. He said the lawyers’ movement had become an example of unity.
“The lawyers have proven that they will not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the rule of law and justice,” he said, adding that appointments in the higher and subordinate judiciary, establishment of new courts, and creation and filling of posts for law officers were the main points of the lawyers’ charter of demands.
After the government accepted the demands, Advocate Amjad Hussain, a member of the GB Assembly, announced the decisions at the sit-in venue. He said the GB lawyers had been struggling for the last 10 months and that their demands had now been accepted.

The new TORs for the commission signal Islamabad’s intent to reclaim the fiscal space ceded to the provinces under the seventh NFC award 15 years ago. The move will be viewed by the provinces as the erosion of their hard-won financial autonomy, and a pushback is inevitable. The new deliverables expect the provinces to shoulder the costs of large development projects, contribute towards federal expenses in the aftermath of natural disasters and finance federal schemes with a provincial impact.
 
 

The centre is also considering firm allocations from the divisible pool for ICT, AJK and GB, which are its responsibility. If agreed, this would effectively allow it to bypass the need to amend the Constitution’s Article 160(3A), which safeguards the provincial share of 57.5pc, to boost its own share. Transfers to the provinces under the award rise to about 59pc if special allocations for KP, Balochistan and Sindh are included.
The new commission has been constituted at a time when the chorus for rebalancing the resource distribution formula under the seventh award is getting louder, with the establishment, finance ministry and IMF supporting a considerable raise in the federal share.
With discussions under the defunct ninth and 10th commissions having collapsed, Islamabad has significantly reversed the balance in its favour by imposing a petroleum development levy and securing cash balances from the provinces in recent years. The provinces did not actively oppose these steps but are not in the mood to give up their share under the award.
There are reasons for the centre’s frustration with the present resource distribution arrangement. Not only does it bear the cost of debt payments, defence and trans-provincial infrastructure, the provinces expect it to help them during natural disasters and finance social protection. Its depleted purse cannot foot the bill. Provinces, on the other hand, resent the centre’s attempts to shift its inefficiencies — ranging from a bloated bureaucracy to fiscal mismanagement — to them, thus undoing their financial autonomy.
 
 

The solution to the centre’s financial woes does not lie in reclaiming a greater share of resources but raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to increase the size of the pie, and halting wasteful expenditure. That said, the provinces also need to transfer fiscal resources to the local governments and increase their tax revenues.
The discussions for a new award should not end in a showdown between the centre and the provinces. It should be used as an opportunity to find a solution to Pakistan’s myriad economic and fiscal challenges.

The National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA), in collaboration with Al-Khidmat Foundation, has dispatched the humanitarian relief consignment for the people of the Gaza Strip.
Officials from the Pakistan Embassy in Cairo received the consignment and handed it over to the Egyptian Red Crescent Society for onward delivery to Palestinian citizens inside Gaza.
The consignment, arranged by Al-Khidmat Foundation, inclu­ded flour, ready-to-eat meals, cooking oil, jam, and fruit cocktails. It was sent via chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore.
According to Pakistan’s embassy, the government and people of Pakistan, with the commendable contribution of Al-Khidmat Foundation, will continue to extend much-needed humanitarian assistance to their Palestinian brethren.
 
 

With this shipment, the total humanitarian assistance provided by Pakistan to Gaza residents has reached 1,915 tonnes. More consignments are scheduled for dispatch in the coming days.
Earlier, a send-off ceremony was held at the Lahore airport, attended by Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, along with officials from NDMA and Al-Khidmat Foundation.

Meanwhile, the agency also taken into custody three human traffickers in separate operations in Taftan.
A spokesperson for FIA said that the operation was conducted on the directives of FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja as part of a crackdown on networks enga­ged in hawala and illegal money transfers.
The arrested suspects were identified as Muhammad Umar, Lal Muhammad, and Abdul Wali.
 
 

Officials said a total of Rs1.7 million was recovered from the accused, along with four mobile phones, registers, and other evidence related to hawala/hundi dealings. The suspects, who failed to provide satisfactory explanations regarding the seized currency, were taken into custody and further investigation has been initiated.
Human traffickers held
Meanwhile, the FIA spokesman said that the agency also arrested three human traffickers in separate operations in Taftan and took four Bangladeshi nationals into custody.
In one operation, FIA Taftan staff launched a raid after receiving intelligence about a gang involved in smuggling people illegally to Iraq via Iran.
During the raid, the agency arrested a notorious trafficker, Muhammad Adnan Aslam, who was linked to an organised network operating from Iraq. He was accused of smuggling Pakistani citizens through illegal rou-tes into Iran and onward to Iraq.

The judge was attending a documentary screening organised by rights group Defence for Human Rights Pakistan, where he delivered remarks to attendees and noted that cases regarding missing persons and disappearances were the most difficult he had come across.
Addressing the gathering, Justice Minallah said that when he ordered that disappearances be investigated or missing people be found, “the authorities would come and they would all say that we don’t know where they are.”
At this, the judge pointed out: “The judge and the court cannot do anything when you don’t have independent investigators.”
Minallah added: “Every judge of the Supreme Court is responsible personally for every violation of fundamental rights that takes place in Pakistan.”
The judge recounted an instance when he suddenly heard the sound of a child crying in his courtroom. Upon asking his staff, the child came forward with his grandmother.
“That was Mudassar Naaru’s child,” Minallah said, referring to the journalist who went missing in 2018. “His mother had passed away and the state had failed to at least let them know whether he was alive, he was dead, or where he was.
“Yes, I wanted to sensitise the issue because there was nothing else that I could do and I would go by the constitution,” he added.
“Under the Constitution, the executive head is the prime minister. I passed an order that this child and his grandmother be taken to the then-prime minister of Pakistan.
“It’s very, very difficult for the courts when the state is not cooperating with you. But the Constitution says that it is the prime minister, the cabinet and then the provinces, the chief minister and the ministers who are responsible. You can’t blame someone else.”
Minallah recalled that he summoned the then-PM to appear in court. “Naaru’s son was also there. He (the prime minister) also assured that child [in court], that his (Naaru’s) whereabouts would be known,” he stated.
“Well, I was in haste elevated to the Supreme Court. But before that, let me say to you, the Islamabad High Court, the first priority was to have competent and fearless judges,” Minallah said. “And for a judge or for a court, the only test is the confidence of the people in that court.”
 
 

The judge noted that it was the duty of the state to investigate these incidents and hold people accountable. Recalling the first judgment he gave, he stated that the directions he gave were “extremely effective during the four-year period that I served as the chief justice”.
“I had made it very clear to the executive that I will not tolerate a single incident of enforced disappearance from within my jurisdiction,” he said.
“But let me say a word. As a judge, I have always respected the parliament and the elected representatives,” he continued. “They have been victims for the past 77 years.”
However, the judge said that in his experience, “those who are in the government … don’t want to be told that this is an issue. And they also want to pretend that this is not an issue. It is an issue.
“It is for the political leadership. When they are in opposition, they are absolutely different.”
Minallah said that during the four years he served as the Islamabad High Court’s chief justice, students from Balochistan would approach the court about disappearances in the province.
“I knew I didn’t have the jurisdiction, but I assumed the jurisdiction,” he said, noting that the Supreme Court and other courts were there.
“When the Balochistan students came, I didn’t know what to do because it was out of my jurisdiction. The investigations had to take place in Balochistan. But the law did provide me with that jurisdiction.”
The judge urged the need for an independent judiciary, adding that the fact that women from Balochistan had to march in the streets for rights was a matter of “shame” for everyone and him.
Concluding his speech, he said: “Those holding exalted offices, I am afraid they haven’t spoken truth in the last 77 years. The day they start speaking the truth, things will change. We have heard some sitting ministers, some former ministers. I wish one day they will also speak the truth because we all know the truth. Everyone knows the truth, but we pretend that we do not know the truth.”
Earlier this week, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the National Judicial Policy Making Committee that a mechanism for producing detained people in cases of enforced disappearances would be presented before the body in its next meeting.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”.
The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-08-24 03:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24074845ade17e0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936335/iranian-forces-kill-six-militants' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian forces kill six militants</strong></a><br><p>TEHRAN: Iranian for­ces killed six militants in a raid in the restive southeast, saying they were members of a  “terrorist” group linked to Israel.
“During an intense exchange of fire with terrorists in Sistan-Baluch­istan province, six assailants were killed and two others arrested,” official news agency IRNA said, citing a statement from the intelligence services.
Sistan-Baluchistan, which borders Pakistan and Afg­hanistan, has long been a flashpoint for clashes bet­ween security forces and armed groups.
The news agency said there were “documents” indicating  “the Zionist nature” of the group targeted in the latest raid, adding that its members had planned to attack a  “vital” facility in Iran’s east, without elaborating.
The report said that “the main operation team” was composed of “seven non-Iranian terrorists”, but did not specify their nationality.
Two intelligence agents and a police officer were wounded in the gunfight.

In an interview with The Times newspaper, Farage said he would withdraw Britain from the Euro­pean Convention on Human Rights and sign deals with Afghanistan, Eritrea and other top countries of origin to repatriate illegal migrants.
“We can be nice to people, we can be nice to other countries, or we can be very tough to other countries … I mean (US President Donald) Trump has proved this point quite comprehensively,” Farage said.
Asked if he was concerned that asylum seekers would be killed or tortured if they were sent to countries with poor human rights records, Farage said he was more worried about the threat he believed asylum seekers posed to Britons.

Small-scale protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers have become frequent

“I can’t be responsible for despotic regimes all over the world. But I can be responsible for the safety of women and girls on our streets,” he said.
Britain has seen regular small-scale protests in recent weeks outside hotels housing asylum seekers, spurred in part by concerns about public safety after some migrants were charged with sexual assault.
 
 

Broader opinion polls show that immigration and asylum are the public’s greatest concern, just ahead of the economy, and Reform UK — which won five seats at last year’s general election — has topped recent voting intention polls.
Last year 37,000 people — mostly from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea — arrived in Britain from France by crossing the English Channel in small boats. The total was up by a quarter from 2023 and accounted for nine per cent of net migration.
About two-thirds of people who arrive via small boats and claim asylum are successful and only three per cent have been deported, according to figures analysed by the University of Oxford.
Farage told The Times he would end the right to claim asylum or to challenge deportation for those who arrived by small boats by replacing existing human rights legislation and opting Britain out of refugee treaties, citing a national emergency.
“The aim of this legislation is mass deportation,” Farage said, adding that a “massive crisis” caused by asylum-seekers was fuelling public anger.
The Times said Farage wanted to create holding facilities for 24,000 migrants on air bases at a cost of 2.5 billion pounds ($3.4bn) and operate five deportation flights a day, with total deportations reaching the hundreds of thousands.
If that failed, asylum seekers could be held on Ascension Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic, to send a symbolic message, Farage said.

Footage from Gaza’s largest city, which Israel plans to seize as part of an ex­­panded military operation, showed wo­men and children among the chaotic jostle of dozens clamouring and shouting for food.
One young boy used his hands to scrape a few leftover grains from the inside of a cooking vat. A girl sat on the edge of a tent and scooped rice from a plastic bag on the ground.
“We have no home left, no food, no income… so we are forced to turn to charity kitchens, but they do not satisfy our hunger,” said Yousef Hamad, 58, who was displaced from the northern city of Beit Hanoun.

The chief of UN agency for Palestinian refugees asks Israel to ‘stop denying the famine it has created’

Further south at a charity kitchen in Deir el Balah, 34-year-old Umm Mohammad said the UN’s declaration of a famine had come “far too late”. The children are  “staggering from dizziness, unable to wake up because of the lack of food and water”, she added.
 
 

The UN officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming the “systematic obstruction” of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of conflict. The Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.
‘Moral duty’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the famine report as “an outright lie”.
On Saturday, the head of the UN agen­­cy for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it was “time for the government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza”.
“All of those who have influence must use it with determination & a sense of moral duty,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X.
 






The IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of Sept­ember, covering around two-thirds of Gaza. Israel kept up its bombardment of the Palestinian territory, with a footage sho­wing heavy smoke billowing above the Zeitoun district of Gaza City as Pales­ti­nians picked through the wreckage of buildings.
‘Feel like end is near’
The spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mahmud Bassal, called the situation in the Sabra and Zeitoun neighbourhoods “absolutely catastrophic”, describing the “complete levelling of entire residential blocks”.
“We are trapped here, living in fear, with nowhere to go. There’s no safety anywhere in Gaza. Movement now leads to death,” said Ahmad Jundiyeh, 35, who was displaced to the northern outskirts of Zeitoun. “We constantly hear the sound of bombing… we hear fighter jets, artillery shelling and even drone explosions,” he said. “We’re extremely afraid — it feels like the end is near.”
Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed on Friday that Israel would destroy Gaza City as it has other parts of the territory if Hamas did not agree to disarm, release all remaining prisoners and “end the war on Israel’s terms”.
Residents of Gaza City said the Israeli strikes targeting the area had been relentless for days. “Let them come and see what’s happening to us here on the ground in Zeitoun district. We have been ruined,” said Aymen Daloul, a 53-year-old from Gaza City whose home had been destroyed.
“We shall sleep on the streets as if we were cattle. Have mercy on us.”
Mahmud Abu Saqer, 24, said there had been a quickening exodus of residents ever since Israel announced its plans to seize Gaza City. “Just this morning, more than 500 to 600 families left, and yesterday thousands left,” he said.

• Omar says PkMAP chief’s nomination to boost opposition alliance
ISLAMABAD: Amid controversy surrounding the nomination of Mahmood Khan Achakzai — the head of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party — and Senator Azam Swati as opposition leaders, PTI insiders have said these appointments will only proceed if former leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz remain barred from parliament.
The party plans to avail all legal options to reverse the disqualification of National Assembly Oppo­s­ition Leader Omar Ayub and Senate opposition leader Shibli Faraz, who were disqualified by the  Election Commission of Pakis­tan in light of the May 9 sentences.
Against this backdrop, the PTI chief earlier this week named Mr Achakzai, who also heads the PTI-led opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, and Senator Swati for these coveted roles. The decision, however, upset many in the party, and a debate ensued over why an outsider was picked to lead the PTI-dominated opposition.
In an apparent move to placate these concerns, insiders in the party told Dawn that the priority was the return of former opposition leaders Omar Ayub and Mr Faraz.
According to PTI’s political com­m­ittee, new nominations will not be made until the appeals of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz are decided. Party Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that the party would stand by the two leaders, hoping that the court would give a favourable ruling in their cases.
Meanwhile, Omar Ayub told Dawn that the new appointment would be finalised only after exhausting all legal means.
“However, it should be kept in mind that Mr Achakzai is a senior leader and also the head of the opposition alliance,” he said, adding, “It is the prerogative of the party founder [Imran Khan] to nominate any person as a candidate for the opposition leader.” Mr Ayub said the decision to nominate the PkMAP chief would strengthen the opposition alliance.
Ex-opposition leader Omar Ayub said that Salman Akram Raja had already made it clear that all the legal platforms would be used to reverse their disqualification but if the government demanded the names for new opposition leaders, in that case, these names would be forwarded to the speaker.
A senior PTI leader, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that although both names were announced, but during the parliamentary party meeting, participants demanded the details of the meeting with Imran Khan.
“Ali Bukhari informed (the meeting) that Imran Khan had said that all legal platforms should be exhausted and after that names of Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati can be given. Khan sahib suggested these names as he feared he might not get an opportunity to meet the party leaders, his sisters, or lawyers till the nomination of the opposition leaders,” he explained.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz had gotten stay orders from courts. “Mr Achakzai was supported by the PTI as a presidential candidate. Imran Khan wants all opposition voices to unite. In the past, we approached Maulana Fazlur Rehman under the same idea and visited his house many times,” he said.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that the first priority was to bring both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back to the NA and Senate.
“However, as a second option, Mr Achakzai has been nominated,” he said, adding the PkMAP chief was named for this role because Mr Khan supported political figures from Balochistan. Mr Achakzai is also a seasoned politician who can lead the movement, he said. “However, I would again say that the priority would be to bring Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz back as leaders of the opposition in both houses,” he reiterated.
It may be noted that Mr Achakzai is a veteran political figure from Balochistan, particularly known for his outspoken stance against the establishment. Swati, a PTI veteran who joined the party before the 2013 elections, was jailed a few years ago and allegedly tortured for his tweet against then army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.

Brennan Johnson and Joao Palhinha struck for the Europa League winners just before half-time as Spurs went top of the table, making it a perfect start for Thomas Frank after two league games in charge.
City’s run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a spectacular end last season as they finished a distant third behind Liverpool and Arsenal. A 4-0 thrashing of Wolves on the opening weekend of the campaign showed glimpses of a revamped City back to their best.
However, they were again easily exposed on the counter-attack, while manager Pep Guardiola must decide who will be his number one goalkeeper after a day to forget for James Trafford.

Ederson was left on the bench amid rumours the Brazilian could join Galatasaray before the transfer window closes. City have been linked with a move for out-of-favour Paris Saint-Germain keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Tottenham took the lead on 35 minutes when Richarlison squared for Brennan Johnson to power past Trafford.
Trafford was fortunate to avoid being punished after rushing outside his box to block Kudus with his arm. But moments later, the England goalkeeper had a moment of madness when he attempted a pass to Nico Gonzalez inside his own box.
Pape Mate Sarr intercepted and, even though the goalkeeper recovered to deny Richarlison, Joao Palhinha smashed home the rebound.
Spurs let a two-goal lead slip late on against Paris Saint-Germain to lose the UEFA Super Cup in Frank’s first game in charge earlier this month, but rarely looked in danger of suffering a similar fate.
“From every game you learn and games where you don’t get the result you learn even more,” said Frank. “Defensive principles and the mentality is the key thing. We need this mentality to win games like this.”
Promoted trio on the board
Villa have failed to score in their opening two games and Brentford secured a big win for new boss Keith Andrews thanks to record signing Dango Ouattara.
The Bees lost not only Frank, but their top scorer last season, Bryan Mbeumo and captain Christian Norgaard in the close season, while Yoane Wissa has sat out Andrews’ first two games in an attempt to force through a move to Newcastle.
Brentford spent a reported £42 million ($58m) on Ouattara to replace Mbeumo and he delivered with the only goal at 12 minutes. The Burkina Faso international sprinted clear of Pau Torres before firing in at the second attempt after Emi Martinez saved his first effort.

Marcus Tavernier scored the only goal as Bournemouth beat 10-man Wolves 1-0. Toti Gomes was dismissed early in the second half for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. Wolves remain without a point.
Burnley secured their first points back in the top flight with a 2-0 win over Sunderland. The Black Cats beat West Ham 3-0 last weekend on their return to the Premier League after an eight-year absence.
But goals from Josh Cullen and Jaidon Anthony brought Sunderland back to earth.
All three promoted sides have now secured a win as they aim to avoid the trend of the past two seasons, when all three teams to come up have gone straight back down.
Leeds began their season by beating Everton 1-0 on Monday, but face a daunting trip to title-chasing Arsenal in Saturday’s late kick-off.
Champions Liverpool travel to Newcastle on Monday with the clubs at a stand-off over Magpies striker Alexander Isak.

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government being toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
FM Dar arrived in Dhaka earlier today for an official two-day trip. Addressing a press conference at the Pakistani High Commission in Dhaka, he extended an invitation to everyone in the gathering to visit Pakistan to engage with their counterparts and contribute to this “new phase of our reinvigorated partnership”.
“Our hearts are open and our intent is most sincere,” FM Dar noted.
The deputy PM said he wanted to underscore the federal government’s “strong desire to forge a cooperative and forward-looking relationship with Bangladesh”.
Dar said Pakistan was committed to engaging with all stakeholders, including the government, political parties, academia, civil society, media and the youth for the realisation of common goals, including peace, progress and prosperity of the two nations and the region.
He said his visit came at a time when the region and the world were undergoing a “rapid transformation”, adding that the challenges of climate change, economic volatility, global inequality and security threats threatened everyone.
“We must work together to create an environment where youth from Karachi to Chittagong, Quetta to Rajshahi, Peshawar to Sylhet and Lahore to Dhaka joined hands to face these challenges and realise their shared dreams.”
He said he was glad to note that bilateral relations had witnessed many positive developments in the past year and there was “significant progress in almost all streams of bilateral cooperation” with an increase in the frequency of high-level exchanges, institutionalised mechanisms of bilateral engagements were being revived, economic and commercial cooperation was gaining momentum, educational and academic collaboaration was being explored and cultural exchanges were also taking place.
“In a nutshell, today, our bilateral relations are characterised by a new energy and fresh enthusiasm.”
He said the developments reflected the desire of both countries to move forward and tap the potential for greater bilateral cooperation for the benefit of their people.
The foreign minister also noted that the two nations enjoyed a commonality of views on many regional and international issues, such as the revival of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
FM Dar said Pakistan appreciated Bangladesh’s role in Saarc’s conception and stressed that South Asia, home to “nearly a quarter of humanity”, could not afford to lag behind in regional cooperation and integration.
“We are hopeful that Saarc will be reinvigorated and our distances will shorten. I sincerely believe that the future of bilateral relations should be characterised by a forward-looking approach based on mutual respect and insulated from external pressures.
“It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our children inherit a relationship that is fraternal, cooperative and filled with affection and opportunities.”
The foreign minister said he was looking forward to his engagements with the Bangladeshi leadership during his trip.
He said it was a “great honour” to be in the Bangladeshi capital at the government’s invitation and expressed his gratitude for the welcome afforded to him and his delegation.
“This evening is special as it brings together a broad spectrum of prominent personalities from politics, academia, business community and media,” he said, adding that he valued the opportunity to interact with them.
He said Pakistan and Bangladesh enjoyed a “multifaceted relationship” that was rooted in shared history, common faith and cultural similarities. “We are two vibrant and dynamic and resilient nations. Our countries are home to the proud people who have faced enormous challenges with dignity and forbearance.”
FM Dar said the bilateral relationship between the two countries was not only political but also grounded in cultural, spiritual and familial ties that stemmed from “centuries of shared traditions, Islamic heritage, social norms, linguistic connections and literary expressions”.
The foreign minister said the above “threads of commonalities were woven into the very fabric of our two societies”, adding that “notwithstanding the twists and turns of history, the people of Pakistan have fraternal sentiments towards the people of Bangladesh and hold them in the highest esteem.
“We recognise and respect the sovereign choices of the Bangladeshi nation and believe in a future where our relations are defined by not what divides us but what unites us.”
 


Earlier, FM Dar received a delegation of the National Citizen Party (NCP), led by General Secretary Akhtar Hossain. He appreciated the NCP leadership’s vision for reform and social justice and emphasised the need for greater interaction between the youth of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The delegation members apprised FM Dar on different facets of countrywide political mobilisation in 2024. The Foreign Office (FO) said the two sides also discussed possibilities to promote cultural exchanges between Pakistan and Bangladesh in the days ahead.
 






The deputy PM also held a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Naib Amir Dr Syed Abdullah Mohammed Taher.
“The ways to strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and the recent developments in the region were two key areas of discussion. The DPM/FM lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Jamaat leaders and activists in the face of hardships and difficulties,” the FO said.
 






In a third meeting, FM Dar welcomed a delegation from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. The FO said the meeting was held in a “cordial atmosphere”.
It said FM Dar expressed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations with Bangladesh on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.
It added that regional cooperation featured prominently in the discussions, during which Bangladesh’s foundational role in establishing the Saarc was “fondly acknowledged”. The FO said the leaders also reflected on past high-level interactions between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
 






According to a press release by the FO, Dar arrived in Dhaka today “on a landmark official visit from August 23-24” on the invitation of Bangladesh’s government. He was received by Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Ambassador Asad Alam Siam, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Muhammad Iqbal Khan and officials of the Pakistan High Commission, it said.
The press release added, “During the visit, the deputy prime minister will hold important meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership, including Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, Adviser for Foreign Affairs Mr Md Touhid Hossain, and Adviser for Commerce Mr SK Bashir Uddin.
“Discussions will encompass the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, including regional and international issues of mutual interest.”
 






Earlier today, the FO said that Dar embarked on a “historic visit to Bangladesh” as the deputy premier departed from the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi. “In Dhaka, he will hold important meetings with Bangladeshi leaders,” it added.
“The visit is a significant milestone in Pakistan-Bangladesh relations as a Pakistani foreign minister is visiting Bangladesh after a gap of around 13 years,” the FO highlighted.
 






The last time a foreign minister paid an official visit to Dhaka was in November 2012, when Hina Rabbani Khar made a six-hour visit to Bangladesh to formally invite then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a summit in Islamabad later that month.
 
 

FM Dar’s meetings are likely to take place tomorrow, according to Bangladeshi news outlet BSS.
The visit is expected to see the signing of four to five memorandums of understanding to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, culture, media, training, and travel, a senior official of Bangladesh’s foreign ministry told BSS.
Dar’s visit comes on the heels of Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan’s official tour to Dhaka, where he met Bangladesh’s advisers for commerce and industries.
 
 

Islamabad and Dhaka are in the process of establishing a joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade, according to the commerce ministry.
The two countries started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, while Fly Jinnah has also secured approval to operate flights from Karachi to Dhaka.
Diplomatic ties were rekindled after 15 years in April with the visit of Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC).
Last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.</p><small>2025-08-23 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2312504685ac286.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935447/imrans-nephew-shershah-handed-over-to-lahore-police-for-5-days-as-hrcp-sounds-alarm' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s nephew Shershah handed over to Lahore police for 5 days as HRCP sounds alarm</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Saturday granted the police a five-day physical remand of PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on Friday. His brother Shahrez Khan, who was picked up on Thursday, was also handed over to police custody yesterday for eight days over the same allegations.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over today’s hearing, where PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shershah’s counsel and Imtiaz Sipra as the prosecutor.
The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill then granted the police Shershah’s five-day custody.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.
Addressing a press conference outside the Lahore ATC, Aleema said her sons had not committed any crime to warrant arrest.
“What is their crime? Their crime is that they are Imran Khan’s nephews … that they are Imran Khan’s family,” she said.
She said that the arrests aimed to put “pressure” on Imran and his family, but added that they were not succumbing to this pressure.
“This is a fight of every Pakistani — it is a duty of every Pakistani — that for this country, its freedom … they play their part,” Aleema said.
She added, “We can play our part by standing with Imran Khan, because he is standing for Pakistan.”
Amnesty International slammed the arrests as part of a “political witch-hunt aimed at intimidating the family members of political opponents” and called on the authorities to immediately release the siblings.
“Their arrest is part of a larger pattern of politically motivated targeting and detention against the PTI to crush political opposition and muzzle dissent in the country. Targeting family members of opposition leaders and activists by the government is becoming an increasingly common practice in Pakistan and must stop.”
 






With both Shahrez and Shershah now in police custody, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was “alarmed” by the arrest of Imran’s two nephews.
“The fact that the arrests were made 27 months after the incident is difficult to understand for any independent observer, having occurred at a time when the trials of other accused persons have been long underway or already concluded,” the HRCP said in a statement.
The commission said it was “deeply concerned about the further backsliding of citizens’ rights and expresses its disappointment in the policing and legal system, particularly when it comes to dealing with political opponents”.
“We demand that the authorities ensure transparency and the rule of law in all such matters,” the HRCP added.
 






Shahrez’s wife, Maria, wrote on her newly made X account that the triathlete was in Chitral on May 9, 2023 at her family home.
She shared a purported image of the metadata of a group photo taken in Chitral that day of Shahrez with her family and friends.
 






Imran’s son Kasim Khan, who along with his brother Sulaiman has been more vocal in recent months about his imprisoned father, had termed his cousins’ arrests as “blatant state repression”.
 






Jemima Goldsmith, the former spouse of Imran, said that no state should be allowed to “target families to settle political scores”.
 






Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’ that as far as the arrest of Shahrez and Shershah was concerned, questions should be raised in a court of law as opposed to against the government.
“Where will these questions be raised? Will they be raised against the government? They should be raised in the court that detained them,” he said.
When pushed on whether politicians should be questioned on politically-motivated arrests, Sanaullah recalled when he was arrested and jailed during the PTI’s tenure in a drugs case.
“We used to question the PTI because they used to politically victimise us — when 15-20 kilogrammes of heroin was found in my car, I didn’t raise those questions with the party, I did it in a court of law,” he explained. “We got relief from the court, not from raising questions in public.”
The adviser, who previously served as an interior minister, stated that in order to create an environment to talk, there cannot be any precondition to drop legal proceedings.
“Has there ever been any dialogue like this, where someone has committed a criminal offence, but their cases need to be withdrawn to negotiate?” Sanaullah asked
“If this is a condition, then present it. As far as Imran Khan’s release is concerned, the PTI’s negotiating committee told us that his release was not up for discussion. This issue (Shahrez and Shershah) can also be discussed if they come to the table.”
When pressed on the possibility of Shahrez having an alibi, Sanaullah highlighted the issue that if there was a picture of him in Chitral or any other country, then the prosecution had photographs of a man standing on a burning car.
“This photo has been on social media for some time,” he said. “They have been in court; they can argue alibis and make statements there. I do not want to be involved because it is not my position to find out the truth.”
The adviser noted, however, that if there was any politically-motivated case against them, then it was “absolutely political victimisation”.
“However, if they were detained in a criminal case or for violence, then the matter will be discussed in court. Then we will see how much truth there is,” he emphasised.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that individuals nominated and wanted in May 9 cases must be jailed and there was “no escape” from legal accountability.
“It is not a matter of personal desire — it is the state’s responsibility to arrest absconders and proclaimed offenders,” she said in a statement without naming either of the two sons.
Condemning the attack on Jinnah House, she remarked, “Those who disrespected a military officer’s uniform are now trying to play the victim card and hiding behind the excuse of ‘privacy’ and ‘sanctity of home’.“
She reiterated that the Punjab government was acting strictly within the law and no one would be considered above it.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests yesterday, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
He asserted that both siblings were present at the scene of the Jinnah House vandalism.
ATC hearing
Similar to the request made in Shahrez’s case, the prosecution today sought Shershah’s 30-day physical remand in the Jinnah House attack case registered at the Sarwar Road police station.
“The suspect was present at the crime scene. A weapon was used at the site,” Sipra told the court, adding that Shershah was allegedly seen in a video from the incident.
“The suspect’s social media accounts have to be recovered,” he contended.
On the other hand, Raja argued that the arrest was “illegal”, noting it was made 27 months after the incident.
“The suspect had appeared in this same court yesterday with Shahrez and was arrested the same day,” the PTI counsel said. “Where was the police for 27 months?” he asked.
 
 

Raja, citing the Supreme Court’s previous directives related to videos, contended that a video had “no value [as evidence] till the person who recorded it appeared in court and spoke of its authenticity”.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir, detailed that Shershah was arrested while on his way home after appearing for his brother’s case hearing.
 


“This case is like Shahrez’s case. We request that the court discharge Shershah from the case,” Mudassir pleaded.

A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. At least 200 people were rescued after a glacier burst in GB, blocking the Ghizer River a day prior.
 
 

Due to yesterday’s glacial burst, water containing debris and heavy stones fell into the river and stopped it from flowing for eight to nine hours.
“The water remained standing, causing river water to spread for seven kilometres and become an artificial lake,” provincial government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, the GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) said that the Ghizer River changed course in the district on August 4 and began flowing over the Gilgit-Chitral Road.
“A lake measuring 2,000 feet long and more than 50 metres wide has emerged in Khatam village as a result of the flood debris, due to which the Gilgit-Chitral Road is still closed,” GBDMA district official Ghufranullah Baig told Dawn.com.
“This lake has affected a small settlement nearby, while trees and a large area of ​​land have been submerged.”
Asraruddin Asrar, a prominent social figure from Ghizer, told Dawn.com that lakes being formed by natural floods in the area were an ongoing phenomenon for a long time.
“Khalti Lake was formed in the 1980s; it still exists and has a great reputation in the area as a tourist attraction,” he said. “Sost Lake came into existence in the 1990s, and a lake was also formed at Haim last year as a result of floods. The largest number of lakes is found in Ghizer district.”
In 2010, a landslide in Attabad blocked the Hunza River, resulting in the renowned Attabad Lake, which is a popular destination for tourists.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
Earlier this month, a glof from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.
A glacier burst in Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person on August 1, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-23 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23180743e5fa5f3.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935792/any-talks-with-india-will-be-on-equal-footing-no-begging-for-negotiations-pcb-chief-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Any talks with India will be on equal footing, no begging for negotiations: PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that any talks on sporting ties with India would be held on equal footing and there would be no more pleading for negotiations.
The suspension of bilateral ties between Pakistan and India has now been officially extended beyond cricket to all sports. On Thursday, India’s sports ministry issued a new policy that ends bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, even on neutral venues. However, no stoppage has been announced for engagement at multilateral tournaments, paving the way for the much-anticipated Asia Cup cricket clash between the two rivals next month.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board had asked sports federations in the country to seek approval before participating in sporting events held in India.
Questioned about sporting ties with India during a press conference in Lahore, Naqvi said: “I think we are very clear that whenever talks are held will be on an equal footing with India and there will be no more begging for negotiations. That time has passed and whatever will happen will be on the basis of equality.”
 


Questioned about the team’s dismal performance and the need for any revamping in it, the PCB chief reassured that the squad would exhibit improvement very soon.
The PCB chief was also asked about visa issues for sports journalists for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, to which he said that a cell had been set up to coordinate visa issuance and whoever needed one would be provided.
Naqvi was also quizzed about the team composition that saw notable players Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan left out to make way for new players, to which he responded: “I do not even have a one per cent role in the team selection.”
He said there was a selection team and an advisory body, adding that all of them sat down and reviewed the squad selection multiple times over long hours and days.
“I have told them that whatever decision is made should be on the basis of merit and I will support it. Whatever lot was available to us, we polished it and took it forward. Our effort is to bring as many new people as possible so we have more competition in cricket and the best people come up.”
The PCB chief called on people to support the team in the Asia Cup match against India and to desist from criticising them, saying that “needless criticism” demotivated players during tournaments.
He also expressed hope of improvement soon in the national women’s squad.</p><small>2025-08-23 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23192940f663130.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935857/ppp-pml-n-announce-jointly-contesting-upcoming-by-elections' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PML-N announce jointly contesting upcoming by-elections</strong></a><br><p>The PML-N and PPP on Saturday announced that they would contest the upcoming by-elections together.
PTI’s 12 lawmakers were disqualified in Punjab by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9 (2023) cases. The disqualified lawmakers hailed from eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly constituencies. The PPP has shown interest in contesting on six vacant seats — NA-143 and PP-203 (Sahiwal), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), and NA-96, NA-104 and PP-98 (Faisalabad) — and sought applications from the interested candidates.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi made the announcement during a press conference in Islamabad with PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari.
“We want to tell our workers and the whole of Pakistan that we are a democracy,” Abbasi said, adding that they would contest the by-polls according to a “predetermined formula”.
“We will contest together. Wherever a PPP candidate is running, the PML-N will support them,” he said. “Wherever a PML-N candidate is running, the PPP will support them.”
Ashraf talked about a meeting between the leadership of both parties regarding the by-elections, stating that a “predetermined formula” had been decided for the polls.
“If a PPP candidate is runner-up in a constituency, federal or provincial, the PML-N will support them,” he stated. “If a PML-N candidate is runner-up in a constituency, then the PPP will support them.”
The PPP leader and former premier said that there was a full agreement between the leaders of both parties, adding that this plan was made on their directions.
“Now there will be no more confusion between us or our candidates,” Ashraf added.
“The people of Pakistan need to know that we are allies,” Abbasi said. “Our leadership makes intelligent decisions. We make sure to say that we are allies in all fora.”
The railways minister said that Sindh and Punjab wished each other well, while both had positive wishes for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, especially amid the recent floods in the northern areas.</p><small>2025-08-23 14:52</small></div><hr>
