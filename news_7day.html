According to state-broadcaster Radio Pakistan, the day began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes in provincial capitals.
Special prayers were offered at mosques after Fajr for the Quaid, as well as for the peace, prosperity and development of the country, the Radio Pakistan report said.
A change of guard ceremony was also held at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi.







‘A visionary leader and a statesman of global stature’
In his message on the Quaid’s birth anniversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “This day offers an opportunity for collective reflection and renewal of our commitment to the Quaid’s guiding principles — democracy, constitutionalism, social justice, religious harmony, and the vision of a welfare state grounded in equality and the rule of law.”
He said the Quaid’s enduring ideals of faith, unity, and discipline remained the foundation of our national strength and a guiding light for future generations.







“A visionary leader and a statesman of global stature, Quaid-i-Azam’s political wisdom, unwavering resolve, and selfless struggle altered the course of history and made possible the creation of an independent homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent,” the premier further stated.
He ended his message with reaffirming “our collective resolve to follow in the footsteps of the Quaid-i-Azam and to carry forward his enduring legacy, in the service of Pakistan’s honour, security, progress, and prosperity”.
‘Quaid’s principles central to our national journey’
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari emphasised the “enduring relevance of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s leadership” and urged the nation to renew its commitment to the democratic and inclusive ideals laid down by him.
Paying tribute to him on his birth anniversary, the president said in a statement that the Quaid’s leadership, vision, and guiding principles continued to inspire the nation in facing contemporary challenges.
The Quaid, he said, “exemplified conviction, perseverance, and hard work that laid the foundation of Pakistan. The Quaid’s principles of democracy, justice, and equality remained central to the country’s national journey and must continue to shape its institutions and decision-making”.
The president said the Quaid’s call for unity, faith, and discipline provided a clear direction to the nation, adding that these ideals were essential for progress, social cohesion, and national confidence.
He urged the nation, particularly the youth, to uphold the Quaid’s ideals and contribute to building a “peaceful, inclusive, and forward-looking Pakistan”.
Zardari also referred to Quaid’s 150th birth anniversary next year.
The government has announced that it will declare 2026 as the “Year of Quaid-i-Azam” to celebrate his 150th birth anniversary.
The president said the milestone would “provide an important opportunity to reflect meaningfully on Quaid’s life and struggle and to renew commitment to his vision while passing his ideals to future generations with honesty and purpose”.
He added that despite the challenges being faced by the country, unity, strength, and resilience would enable the nation to move forward.
‘Statesman of unwavering principles’
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted that the birth anniversary and Christmas fall on the same day, saying this shared occasion reflected the “inclusive vision and moral foundations upon which Pakistan was established”.
In his video message, he said, “The Quaid was not only the architect of our independence but [was also] a statesman of unwavering principles and exceptional clarity.”
He said that the Quaid had envisioned Pakistan as a democratic state functioning on the principles of equality and respect for the fundamental rights of all citizens.
“Our commitment to protect minority rights, equality and religious freedom remains a cornerstone of our Constitution and national ethos,” he said.







Military leadership pays tribute to Quaid
The country’s military leadership also paid tribute to the Quaid on his birth anniversary.
A statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid rich tributes to him.
It added that the armed forces “reaffirm their unwavering commitment to Quaid-i-Azam’s vision of a strong, sovereign, democratic and prosperous Pakistan, founded on the principles of faith, unity and discipline”.
They emphasised that Quaid-i-Azam’s “exemplary leadership, constitutionalism and steadfast resolve continue to guide the nation and its armed forces in confronting contemporary challenges,” the statement added.
It further stated that the armed forces were reiterating their resolve to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and to contribute wholeheartedly towards national stability, peace, and development, in line with the ideals and aspirations of the Quaid.
“Pakistan’s armed forces remain steadfast in their commitment to uphold the legacy of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and to serve the nation with honour, courage and devotion,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-25 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/251121538b7b329.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963161/christian-community-an-integral-part-of-pakistans-national-fabric-says-pm-shehbaz-in-christmas-message' target='_blank'><strong>Christian community an integral part of Pakistan’s national fabric, says PM Shehbaz in Christmas message</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that Pakistan’s Christian community, which is celebrating Christmas today, is an integral part of the country’s national fabric.
“Pakistan’s Christian community forms an integral part of our national fabric. Their enduring contributions to education, healthcare, and social welfare, and their sacrifices alongside the nation in the fight against terrorism, are deeply valued and a source of collective pride,” the premier said in his Christmas message on the social media platform X.







He extended his “warmest greetings” to the Christian community across the world, and “especially to our Christian brothers and sisters in Pakistan”.
“May this festive season fill hearts with joy, strengthen bonds of harmony, and bring peace, hope, and prosperity to all,” the premier said.
Separately, a statement carried by state-run APP quoted him as saying that Christmas “conveys a universal message of love, peace, tolerance, and goodwill for all humanity”.
He highlighted the role of the Christian community in Pakistan, saying that they were “an active, positive and peaceful segment of society and had rendered commendable services in education, healthcare and other sectors, contributing to social harmony and national development”.
The premier said ensuring equal rights, freedoms, economic well-being, and equal opportunities for all citizens without discrimination remained among the top priorities of the government and urged people of all faiths to work together for a strong, secure, and prosperous Pakistan.
‘Christmas a time of hope, peace, compassion’
According to state broadcaster PTV News, President Asif Ali Zardari also extended greetings and wishes to Christians in Pakistan and across the world on Christmas.
In his message, he said, “Christmas is a time of hope, peace and compassion. The message of love and service to humanity that this season brings reminds us of the deep bonds that unite all people.”







He also recalled Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah‘s address to the first Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947, saying that he had articulated a vision of Pakistan rooted in freedom and equality for all.
The president message cited an excerpt from the Quaid’s speech, stating: “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan.
“You may belong to any religion, caste or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State.”
President Zardari said that “these words remain a powerful commitment to religious freedom and mutual respect among citizens”.
He highlighted that Christian citizens of Pakistan had made important contributions to society in politics, national defence, education, literature, arts, music, healthcare, social welfare and public service.
“Their efforts strengthen our shared progress and enrich our national life.”
The president further stated that Pakistan’s Constitution guaranteed equal rights and freedom of religion for every citizen.
“We remain committed to fostering harmony, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among all communities. Our diversity is a source of strength and should inspire greater unity, understanding and cooperation,” he said.
The president concluded his message, saying, “May the spirit of Christmas inspire us all to uphold compassion and justice and to work together for the welfare of our nation.”
The armed forces also extended “heartfelt” Christmas greetings to the Christian community, acknowledging their valuable contributions to the nation’s progress, APP reported, citing a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations.
It said that the armed forces reaffirm the commitment to the Quaid’s vision of equal rights, religious freedom and harmony for all citizens.</p><small>2025-12-25 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1410413640eb5ce.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930653/if-the-quaid-came-home' target='_blank'><strong>If the Quaid came home</strong></a><br><p>This piece was originally published on Aug 14, 2025.

It’s a bit of a tired theme: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, briefly returned from the pearly gates, walks around the country he’s created. He sees violence, corruption, poverty, extremism, and an unlawful regime lording over it. Perhaps, nearly 80 years on, freedom means something else.
He’s shocked, regrets what he’s founded, and calls it a day — or becomes a vehicle for some conservative columnist to tell the public what they should be doing instead. Only, the question lingers: would the Quaid have been all that surprised by what he’d seen?
Because Jinnah witnessed violence, corruption, poverty and extremism under an unlawful regime for most of his years. And that’s without touching on the constant defeats that rutted his path: his family business collapsing around the time he returned from London; Gandhi elbowing him offstage as India’s most promising politician by 1920; the civil liberties he championed crushed by the British Raj; and the Nehru Report setting fire to Hindu-Muslim unity — the work of a lifetime. His own.
In fact, the odds against anything resembling Pakistan were brutal before 1946: the Unionist Party’s obese landlords ran Punjab; Sindh was in the grips of Gandhian arch-feudal Soomros; the frontier was ruled by Congressites outright; and Balochistan wasn’t even on the provincial map.
Lesser men, almost all men, would have surrendered; yet others would have haggled for scraps from within the Raj’s cage. But Jinnah had long understood that freedom was a terrible, vital business: not so much the absence of pain, but the choice to endure it for something essential to being alive.

 

For freedom’s sake
After all, beyond those dry law books, Jinnah was an idealist — no freedom fighter isn’t. His friend, Sarojini Naidu, called it right as early as 1917: “Never was there a nature whose outer qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth.” If he was skinny, it concealed “exceptional … endurance”; if he was aloof, it hid a “naïve and eager humanity”. If he seemed too rational and practical, it was only to “disguise a shy and splendid idealism”.
It’s also how he changed map of the world — by keeping his eyes fixed to the eternities. As has been said of British premier Disraeli’s career (whom Liaquat Ali Khan enjoyed comparing to Jinnah): “Failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure. Ultimate and complete victory.”
But such victory can never be complete: if indeed the Quaid came home, he’d have found freedom in recession. We know this not from speculation, but from decades of documentary record.
Interestingly, most of that record is nowhere to be found on August 14: beyond a few bumper stickers, Jinnah seems to have become much too radical, and thereby much too dangerous, for his own country to contend with.
Jinnah vs the state
For starters, consider liberty: is a citizen free if they can be tried by a military tribunal? Said Jinnah in 1919, “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” The Supreme Court disagreed last May, and chose to cite Ayub Khan’s laws rather than the founder’s speech.
That brings us to the judiciary itself, the crown jewel of any free republic. But are the judges in a position to safeguard the people’s rights, now that the executive has snatched away their powers via the 26th amendment?

 

“Powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused,” said Jinnah. He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’
The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest. The regime may think, as the British once had, that Jinnah doth protest too much. London’s Edwin S. Montagu once asked him acidly, “Have you ever known any proposal come from any government which met with your approval?”
And yet the Quaid wasn’t instinctively opposed to the state: he viewed a free country as one where the executive was in charge — just not its armed forces. He warned a future chief of general staff in 1947, “Never forget that you are the servants of the state. You do not make policy. It is we, the people’s representatives, who decide how the country is to be run. Your job is only to obey the decision of your civilian masters.”
Yet what of said people’s representatives? As blanket convictions stream in and lawmakers are flung out of the assembly, it’s hard not to remember the Quaid’s words when Satyendra Chandra Mitra, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, was slapped with preventive detention: “Here is a man who was arrested under a most obnoxious law which gives the executive absolute power to imprison a man on suspicion without trial … How long are you going to prevent him from what he is entitled to do?”
And if the state cried law and order, he replied, “Is it to be performed in spite of the will of the people … by retaining a most reactionary and oppressive measure …? I maintain sir, that if the government were really responsive to public opinion, all the revolutionary organisations and anarchical organisations that you are now talking of and which you want to arrest and to destroy…will disappear.”

 

This was part of a broader, daring stance — that violence and disorder stem not from uncontrollable populations, but unresponsive rule. Jinnah may well have been addressing Balochistan when he said, “Why do these educated young men take to bombs? Have you ever thought of it? … The way to prevent bombs being thrown is to meet the people, respond to their feelings, their sentiments and their legitimate and proper aspirations.”
It most certainly isn’t to punish those who raise their voices for a better world, as we’re seeing today: journalists thrown on stop lists and anchors taken off television. Yet again, the barrister from Bombay was clear: “I say, protect the innocent, protect those journalists who are doing their duty and who are serving both the public and the government by criticising the government freely, independently, honestly, which is an education for any government.”
Back to the Raj
In sum, Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s starting point was freedom. As the late lawyer-historian A.G. Noorani wrote, no parliamentarian spoke as sharply to the British “or their Indian stooges” as Jinnah: “There was no nationalist more fervent than he; no stronger champion of freedom from British rule.”
Because freedom was the end in and of itself. That seems hard to believe these days: as we recently read in these pages, Faisalabad’s anti-terrorism court handed down scores of convictions over the 9 May riots by reasoning the law was well-drafted and wide-ranging: arch-imperialist Lord Macaulay, “the first law-giver of the subcontinent”, had authored it after “the famous mutiny of 1857”.

 

It’s already been questioned why the court would compare itself to its colonisers, and the PTI to yesterday’s rebels. But as a scholar of the Raj — if not of our own freedom movement — the learned judge would also know what Macaulay had written when those rebels were fired from cannons in Peshawar: that “their heads, legs, arms, flying in all directions was read with delight”. Reflected Macaulay, “I could be very cruel just now if I had the power.”
The learned judge would also know that these weren’t the emotional outbursts of a jolted regent, but sober policy directions, steeped in the racial superiority of an alien overclass. All things considered, Macaulay thought us unfit for self-rule anyway; that what we could really “have [is] the next best thing — a firm and impartial despotism”; and that the British carried with them “all the noblest virtues of a sovereign caste”. By jingo, chaps.
In fairness to Faisalabad, the anti-terrorism courts quote Macaulay instead of Jinnah in the same way the Supreme Court leans harder on Ayub’s Pakistan than the Quaid-i-Azam’s. As the song goes, it looks like freedom but it feels like death.
All of which is to say that if Jinnah indeed came home today, the story of his life points to anything but a lament, a lecture, a sad retreat in the rain. What it points to is, frankly, audacity: that no wall can’t be breached — the Congress, the provincials, empire itself; none yielded willingly, and all looked permanent until the moment they fell. But fall they did, and Pakistan was born.
So we continue. And we keep the faith.</p><small>2025-12-25 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25112833b3ba053.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-after-nearly-17-years-in-exile-ahead-of-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns after nearly 17 years in exile ahead of polls</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman returned to Dhaka on Thursday after nearly 17 years in exile, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in the February 12 elections.
Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from the capital’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners, and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the Dhaka airport under tight security.
Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.
Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman waved to the crowd with a gentle smile.
He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home.
Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.
His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.
The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasinas removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda Zia largely alternated in office.
A December survey by the US based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.
Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.
Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.
While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman‘s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</p><small>2025-12-25 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/250933067e36711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963159/ex-sapm-mirza-shahzad-akbar-attacked-in-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-SAPM Mirza Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar was attacked in the United Kingdom, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since April 2022, leaving him “bruised and fractured”, it emerged on Thursday.
“I have been attacked and been in the hospital and with the police. Bruised and fractured [sic],” the ex-SAPM said in text messages after Dawn reached out to him, seeking confirmation of a post about the incident on PTI’s X account.
The PTI’s post at 9:50pm PKT on Wednesday said Akbar was attacked at his house in Cambridge in the morning.
“The attacker punched him repeatedly in the face, as a result of which his nose and jaw were fractured,” it said.
“Local police have collected all details, and an investigation is underway,” the party said.
Akbar, who was the accountability adviser in the PTI government, was previously also attacked in November 2023 at his home in Hertfordshire.
The attacker, a masked individual, had thrown acidic liquid at Akbar, the former SAPM had shared in a post on X, adding that, “I will not be intimidated nor bow down to those who are doing this”.
Akbar had linked the attack to the Al Qadir Trust case against PTI founder Imran Khan, alleging that security agencies were harassing him to give evidence against the ex-premier.
Separately, he had told Dawn, “I have been sent messages in recent months by people who are clearly not happy with me. I’ve been told to mend my ways or else…”
Akbar had initiated legal action against the government of Pakistan in a UK court in April 2024 over the acid attack. He told Dawn that he had also sent notices to the Pakistan High Commission in UK and other Pakistani officials.
However, in May 2024, the Foreign Office had “categorically rejected” what it said were “preposterous” claims by Akbar about the alleged involvement of state officials in the 2023 acid attack on him.
Meanwhile, Akbar has been declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court in a case pertaining to alleged controversial statements made on X. Subsequently, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott, handing over extradition papers for Akbar.
While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.</p><small>2025-12-25 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25101150532a4a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963145/jinnahs-democratic-legacy-challenges-prospects' target='_blank'><strong>Jinnah’s democratic legacy: challenges & prospects</strong></a><br><p>

THE Quaid categorically declared that no power on earth can undo Pakistan.

QUAID-I-AZAM Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a charismatic statesman, laid the foundation for a modern democratic state, Pakistan, to safeguard the fundamental rights of Muslims who were a minority in pre-Partition India. Pakistan was born as a secular democratic state, but its welfare and prosperity will always depend upon the restoration of Jinnah’s democratic legacy. Despite cultural, religious, or ethnic distinctions, Jinnah steadfastly believed that each Pakistani is an equal citizen; justice, honesty, and impartiality are the guiding principles that protect the right to life, property, and religious beliefs. Hence, for Jinnah, democracy ensures justice for all.
Pakistan’s great founder wanted neither a theocratic state nor a feudal one.
For Jinnah, democracy was a matter of conviction. ‘Democracy’ means people-centred decision-making, which enables individuals not only to elect their representatives but also to devise public policies, enact laws and amend constitutions through public reasoning for the common good. Democracy treats all citizens as equal members of the state.
“Let us lay the foundations of our democracy”
Democracy is one of the cardinal attributes of a modern state. The new independent states in the subcontinent, Pakistan and India, adopted the British democratic political structure in their respective countries. The constitutional approach was the only political solution for this region, and it was more than necessary for the two neighbours to develop democratic systems to preserve the principles of equal citizenship, justice and freedom of expression. The rule of law is essential for democracy. In The Legacy of Quaid-i-Azam, Dr Javid Iqbal states that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, being a celebrated lawyer, had a firm belief in the rule of law rather than the rule of individuals. The rule of law strengthens institutions, not individuals. He writes: “Quaid-i-Azam obviously stood for a strong, independent and irreproachable judiciary because human rights could not be protected and enforced without such a judiciary”. Jinnah has repeatedly asserted that only an independent judiciary can protect the democratic rights of all people in a state.

 

Democracy is the foundation of Pakistan. In a speech at Sibi Durbar on February 14, 1948, the Quaid declared: “Let us lay the foundations of our democracy based on truly Islamic ideals and principles. Our Almighty has taught us that our decisions in the affairs of the State shall be guided by discussions and consultations”.

In The Legacy of Quaid-i-Azam, Dr Javid Iqbal states that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, being a celebrated lawyer, had a firm belief in the rule of law rather than the rule of individuals. The rule of law strengthens institutions, not individuals.

Jinnah also announced, forcefully so, that the affairs of the state should be decided through debate and dialogue to serve the people of his great nation.
Jinnah, time and again, professed that the constitution of Pakistan must be democratic. In a broadcast to the people of the USA in February 1948, he said: “The constitution of Pakistan has yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly. I do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be a democratic type, embodying the essential principles of Islam…. It has taught equality of man, justice, and fair play to everyone.
We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan”.
Surely, this statement affirms Jinnah’s pristine vision for a democratic constitution of Pakistan.

 

Did Jinnah want a theocratic state? This question seeks a distinction between an Islamic state and a Muslim state. An Islamic state means adopting a particular sect or religion as its constitution, which imposes a single ideology on all in the country. In contrast, a Muslim state provides religious freedom to all citizens. Hence, the father of the nation’s is a Muslim state grounded in the key principles of Islam. In a broadcast to the people of Australia on February 19, 1948, he insisted that “Pakistan is not a theocracy or anything like it.” So, our visionary founder’s Muslim state is a democratic state in which people can practice their beliefs, are free, equal and united; they cannot be subjected to any coercion, fear, exploitation or exclusion.
When Mohammad Ali Jinnah was elected as the first president of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, he presented a broad vision for a Muslim democratic state in his historic speech on August 11, 1947. He elaborated on the government’s primary duty, identified social evils, determined the role of the state, and the obligations of citizens for a progressive Pakistan. “The first duty of a government is to maintain law and order so that the life, property, and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state”. Jinnah insisted on the provision of the right to life, property, and liberty, including the right to religious practice, in Pakistan.
A man of tremendous foresight, Jinnah also identified bribery, corruption, nepotism, and black-marketing as the major social evils that damage institutions, and urged the Assembly to eradicate these ills from society. He added: “Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, and especially of the masses and the poor”. The Quaid’s was an unwavering conviction— without the well-being of the people, no state can prosper.
The sense of a nation
The founder stated that the progress of a state relied on the recognition of citizenship as a primary shared identity among its members. “If you … work together in a spirit that every one of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what his colour, caste or creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this state with equal rights, privileges and obligations, there will be no end to the progress you will make”. It is the shared identity of being citizens of Pakistan, and not anything else, that can foster a sense of a nation among people despite their many differences.
“You are free; you are free to go to your temples; you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has nothing to do with the business of the State…We are starting in the days when there is no discrimination between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one State…. Now, I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal, and you will find that in the course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State”.
These words serve as evidence of Jinnah’s immaculate vision for Pakistan.


QUAID-I-AZAM speaking at the Independence Day dinner at the Governor-General’s House in Karachi on August 14,
1947.

Jinnah’s democratic legacy is one of equal rights. For instance, he entrusted Jogendra Nath Mandal to be the first law minister of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, paving the way for the participation of minorities in governance. “I shall always be guided by the principles of justice and fair play without any.… prejudice or ill-will, in other words, partiality or favouritism. My guiding principle will be justice and complete impartiality, and I am sure that with your support and cooperation, I can look forward to Pakistan becoming one of the greatest nations of the world.” Our democratic inheritance from the founding father cannot be squandered.
In his essay, What if Mr Jinnah returned? Khaled Ahmed wondered whether the founder would prefer a constitution that keeps the judiciary independent of the executive? Alternatively, what if the father of the nation appeared in the parliament, public offices, courts, and police stations as an impartial spectator to see whether his citizens are being treated fairly and have access to justice? Would the Quaid not be happier to witness his own vision of fair play, merit, impartiality, freedom, and the rule of law being practiced in the public offices of Pakistan? Pakistan has moved away from Jinnah’s progressive idea of it. Soon after independence, the country stood trapped between neocolonial authoritarianism and theocracy. In The Sole Statesman, Ardeshir Cowasjee says “Jinnah intended Pakistan to be a democratic, forward-looking, modern, secular state. The bigots and the uneducated will always preach otherwise–and it will remain their privilege to do so”. He added that “Jinnah’s Pakistan died with him”. Later, Cowasjee also stated, “In a way, it was fortunate that Jinnah did not live long enough to see the negation of his principles, the perversion of his vision”.
Pakistan’s imperfect present
Now, Pakistan stands at the brink of an existential crisis due to numerous crucial challenges: theocracy, neocolonialism, overpopulation, violation of human rights, poor human development, extremism, political uncertainty, economic instability, corruption, poverty, brain drain, and a compromised educational system. All these challenges are manmade and therefore resolvable. Democracy is key as only opening dialogue and arriving at a political reconciliation will assuage discontent, mistrust and socioeconomic distress for a peaceful Pakistan.
Democracy in Pakistan is hostage to the theocracy, a neocolonial mindset, egoistical authoritarianism and fascist tendencies. The theocratic mind always tends to control freedom and egalitarianism in the country. In Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask, Khaled Ahmed argues that dogmatic ideology is taking the state away from democracy toward fascism worldwide. In Pakistan, he believes, “The state has indoctrinated the masses in favour of a revival of the medieval state rather than a ‘modern’ state”. By doing so, the state refuses to meet modern challenges because indoctrination closes all doors to realistic solutions. There is a dire need to liberate the Pakistani mind from the theocratic mind to develop a rational and critical mind through quality education, which is integral for a Pakistan that is modern and truly democratic.
The colonial legacy of governance has diminished the democratic culture of the country. In Confronting Empire, Eqbal Ahmad argued that Pakistan has never been able to decolonise since its independence. He stated that the situation remained the same after independence because “A British-trained army, a British-trained bureaucracy, and the same feudal landlords who had collaborated with the British, constitute the triangle of power…Nothing else has changed. So, the economic reality has not changed, and the political reality has not changed”. Eqbal Ahmad’s claim of neocolonialism is not easy to refute. So, it is undeniable that both theocracy and neocolonialism continue to derail Pakistan’s democratic process.
Despite all these challenges, democracy still holds significant meaning, and promise, in Pakistan. For instance, its vibrant youth and cultural diversity are two major catalysts for reform and change. The youth forms a large part of Pakistan’s population. And it has, to some extent, attained political consciousness, which is mandatory for the advancement of democracy in the country.
Cultural diversity is a blessing for any democracy; each culture has its own language, art, way of life and cuisine, which should be seen as a valuable opportunity to learn and integrate. Cultural diversity nurtures innovation, creativity and knowledge, while democracy cultivates reasoning in the public sphere.
The Quaid categorically declared that no power on earth can undo Pakistan.
However, a bright future for Pakistan depends on the extent to which it embraces Jinnah’s democratic ideals and principles in letter and spirit. The restoration of his values can make Pakistan invincible. Democracy is the sole cure for extremism, neocolonialism, the disease of corruption, poverty, and political instability. Jinnah believed in fostering the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, autonomy of institutions, decision-making through public reasoning, and the moral values of equality, freedom, fraternity, justice, fairness, and impartiality in the country. Pakistan, indeed, is Jinnah’s precious gift of freedom. But a future that is grounded in solidarity depends upon intellectual decolonisation through quality education to resolve contemporary sociopolitical, and economic problems. To conclude, Pakistan needs a paradigm shift from present policies for a progressive future.

Quaid-i-Azam at his favourite residence on Mount Pleasant Road in Bombay.

IN the current phase of our beautiful, beleaguered country’s history, institutional deviation and constitutional deformities have reached abysmal lows. This special report is being published on the birthday of an individual who had unshakable respect for institutional integrity and individual accountability in life, not immunity for life. The invitation to write encouraged one to consider anecdotal aspects to portray the Quaid’s life from inception to conclusion through fleeting glimpses, snatches of scenes, bits and pieces, which juxtaposed together, evoke his unlikely beginnings, unique persona, values and respect for institutions.
So much is already widely known about the pivotal role of M.A. Jinnah, especially between 1935 and 1948. One therefore decided to select relatively less known aspects. Herein are segments from the Quaid’s early years and then, with a deliberate leap over the next 40 years or so, random clips from the last 13 months.
A disconcerting birth
For data about his arrival on earth, and early years, one relied on the account recorded by his sister Fatima Jinnah.
She spent the most time with him. In addition to being one of his six siblings, she also spent a total of 28 years with him as his sole housekeeping custodian and sister, in two phases. Initially from about 1910 to 1918. Then, following Ruttie Jinnah’s death in February, 1929 (after about 10 years of a tumultuous marriage from 1919 to 1929), for a total of 26 years, living in close proximity, and frequent interaction. Her book My Brother presumed to have been written about 15 years after his demise during 1963-64, was published in 1967. Though the late eminent scholar Sharif ul Mujahid states in his preface that “… an extremely controversial passage…” had to be excluded, the published version comprises only three chapters which “…truthfully reproduce…” the contents of the original manuscript, now stored in the National Archives, Islamabad.

 

With the most reputed midwife of Karachi attending to a home-based delivery in 1876 by mother Mithibai, Fatima Jinnah writes; “… the baby boy was weak and tiny, having slim, long hands, and a long, elongated head. The parents were seriously worried about his health, this little baby that was underweight by quite a few pounds…” Despite the doctor’s assurance that the low weight factor should not cause worry, Mithibai insisted that her spouse Jinnah Poonja, herself and the baby travel soonest to Ganod in the small princely state of Gondal, Kathiawar where the venerated holy man Hasan Pir was buried, to seek his blessings for her frail first-born.
Braving a storm en route by sailing boat through the Arabian Sea, to the port of Verawal, thence by bullock cart through village Paneli to the destination of the great Sufi’s tomb, Mithibai and Jinnah Poonja fondly saw the tiny tot’s head shaved for the aqeeqa. With silent, saintly blessings absorbed, the return to Karachi commenced with a rich feast in Paneli where all villagers joined to celebrate the birth of the boy named Mohammad Ali.

There was a poignant contrast in the last stretch. Just as Pakistan’s genesis moved towards the triumph of reality, the great leader’s already frail body was being eroded from within. His fragility became increasingly apparent around, and onwards of 1940.

An unstudious boy
Yet even though he was already the apple – and the orange – of his mother’s eye, his early childhood years worried his father. The boy was far more interested in “…abandoning books for marbles, tops, gilli danda and cricket…”.

 

He had already joined, and soon left, a primary school close to his home in Kharadar because he spurned studies and classrooms. Prematurely, to please his father, he insisted on attending to office work. But soon, his virtual illiteracy prevented participation in conduct of transactions and business. In just two months, the light dawned.
He told his father: “… I would like to go back to school”. He then “…wanted to make up for lost time, as boys of his age and even younger than him had gone ahead of him. He took to his lessons with a vengeance, studying into the late hours of the night at home, determined to forge ahead….” But another disappointment came up. The teacher told his father that “…the boy is horrible in arithmetic….” was ominous news for a businessman who wanted his son to secure future financial bonanzas. He decided to take the boy to a school a long mile away from home, far enough from distracting local friends.
And so the ten-year-old gained admission in 1886 to the fourth standard Gujarati in the well-reputed Sind Madrassah. But, it soon seemed the boy was incorrigible. He “…continued to woo success and victory on the playfield, rather than at school….”
When the boy’s aunt, Manbai Poofivisited Karachi from her Bombay home to spend a few days with her brother Jinnah Poonja and his family, it was agreed that the unstudious boy would proceed with her to Bombay to be admitted to the Anjuman-i-Islam School where, fortuitously, he passed the fourth standard exam, “…enabling him to be admitted in first standard English….” Despite this success, a mother’s love prevailed over a father’s ambitions. The boy soon returned to Karachi, to be readmitted to Sind Madrassah on December 23, 1887. Some unease abided, to resurface four years later. For, on his son’s insistence, his father moved him out of the prestigious school on January 5, 1891 to be admitted to the Catholic Missionary High School on Lawrence Road where the boy became restless yet again. Just a month later, he was returned to Sind Madrassah on February 9, 1891 in fourth standard English.
Equestrian adventures
Meanwhile, back at the Kharadar ranch, the boy who would not settle into school found stallions far more exciting. Using his father’s fine stable of horses, accompanied by a friend named Karim Kassim, the two would make the other two whose reins they held, trot and gallop for long hours every day. Moving swiftly between horse-carriages on the streets of Karachi, the most visible means of transport for the well-off, or ‘aristocratic’ families, the errant son continued to cause concern to his doting parents. Mithibai would steadfastly declare that her Mohammad Ali would one day become a great man.
England beckons
As General Manager of Graham Trading and Shipping Company — an enterprise in close commercial contact with Jinnah Poonja’s firm – Frederick Croft should be credited for initiating a transformative phase in the life of a restless 16-year-old teenager. He suggested that the boy be sent to London to work at the head office of Croft’s firm for about three years where, among other skills, he could also gain high proficiency in English while learning to adjust to new challenges. Intense debate ensued between the parents. Mithibai most reluctantly agreed to allow her beloved firstborn to leave – provided he was first wed to prevent him from being entrapped by an English woman. The search led to 15-year-old Emibai in distant Paneli village, Kathiawar.
The family then proceeded again by boat from Karachi to Verawal, then by bullock cart to the bride’s home. After lavish festivities, the new couple returned to Karachi. Soon thereafter, with his mother’s tears and prayers blending for a heart-wrenching farewell, the son began the three-week journey to what became a four-year life-changing experience. The father had already remitted a large sum to London to pay for his expenses.
Sent to learn commerce, the youth soon learnt much more elsewhere. Mohammad Ali listened to debates in the House of Commons, to rhetoric at Hyde Park Speakers’ Corner, viewed Shakespeare’s plays, noted the names of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) inscribed in Lincoln’s Inn as one of the world’s greatest law-givers, canvassed votes for Bombay Zoroastrian, and earlier, one of the four founders of the Congress Party, Dadabhai Naoroji’s narrow victory as the first non-Englishman elected from a London constituency to parliament.
In short, Jinnah rejected the very reason for being sent to England by his father. Instead, as recounted by him about half a century later in 1946 to Nasim Ahmed, Dawn’s correspondent in London, he even considered a career on the stage. His appetite for acting … possibly as Romeo … was whetted by brief experience with a touring company. Until his shocked father, who belatedly learnt of new plans, instantly and categorically ruled that out.
All the while, he preserved chastity.

 

When his Russell Street landlady’s pretty daughter reminded him that they happened to be “standing together chatting under a mistletoe on Christmas Eve and that custom required the man to kiss the woman”, Jinnah politely declined to do so because, as he told her, his faith and culture did not permit such indulgence. did fall head over heels in love with reading, and voraciously so.
From newspapers to law books to poetry to plays by Shakespeare. From the extreme of abandoning books in childhood to cherishing their infinite value as he grew into adulthood.
He was also recovering from the news of dual tragedies at home. First his childbride Emibai’s death who he barely knew, followed by the profound loss of one he knew from his very first breath, his adoring mother Mithibai who passed away giving birth to her seventh child.
Perhaps these two traumas instilled a new resolve — to fulfill his mother’s dreams and be the youngest ever law student to become a barrister from Lincoln’s Inn. Then return to Karachi, and Bombay, to help his father recover from the huge losses suffered in business.
From trials to new heights


THE Quaid with his beloved sister, and formidable supporter, who devoted 28 years of her life to his mission.

Preferring law practice in larger Bombay to small-town Karachi from 1897 to about 1900 was like an anti-climax to the hopes nurtured by success in the London exams. His secretary in later years, M.H. Saiyid in his book Mohammad Ali Jinnah (A Political Study), in 1945 wrote: “The first three years were of great hardship and although he attended his office regularly every day, he wandered without a single brief. The long and crowded footpaths of Bombay may, if they could only speak, bear testimony to a young pedestrian pacing them every morning from his new abode in a humble locality in the city, to his office in the Fort, and every evening back again to his apartments after a weary, toilsome day spent in anxious expectation.”
Ironically, momentous change yet again began through the intervention of an Englishman, John Macpherson, the acting advocate-general of Bombay. Jinnah became the first-ever local practitioner to be invited to work in the advocate general’s chamber. Obviously, some hint of the intelligence and potential possessed by the young barrister must have come through to the senior luminary who was later knighted. Hearing about a vacancy for a temporary presidency magistrate, the freshly-recruited lawyer boldly initiated contact with his employer ‘s support, and Sir Charles Olivant, member in-charge of the judicial department, who then became the third Englishman to play a catalytic role in opening dramatic new vistas for Jinnah’s ascent to outstanding professional success.
Forty years later
Many articles by other writers published in Dawn have already done justice to crucial phases of the founder’s life between 1900 and 1940. In this rumination, while even excluding glimpses of his singular love for Ruttie Jinnah, arbitrary focus is on random segments between 1940 and 1948.
Age, frailty and fanaticism
Except for Mahatma Gandhi, born in 1869, who was seven years older than Jinnah, the Muslim League’s leader was the oldest among the three most important political figures who played decisive roles in the creation of Pakistan and India. Gandhi had an overarching influence but did not wield the operational Congress policy direction that Nehru did. The latter was born in 1889. He was thirteen years younger and was 58 years old at Independence while Mountbatten was 24 years younger and was only 47 years of age in 1947.
Jinnah, at 71, was the oldest of the three protagonists. But was also the one most notably becoming physically vulnerable to ill-health.
In 1953, A.R. Casey, the governor of Bengal in 1946, noted that “I have looked up my personal diary, and I find that I emphasised, in several references, the fact that he (M.A. Jinnah) looked very frail.” However, he could sustain long periods of active discussion without any sign of tiring …a couple of hours at a time…. My wife and I dined with him and his sister at Government House in Karachi … in March 1948. At this same dinner my wife made some comment about someone or other being “a fanatic.” Jinnah said, “Don’t decry fanatics. If I hadn’t been a fanatic, there would never have been Pakistan.”
August 7, 1947
As the Dakota aircraft afforded an aerial overview of New Delhi soon after taking off with the Quaid, Fatima Jinnah and his small staff on its way to Karachi, the first ADC to the founder, Mian Ata Rabbani was seated immediately behind his leader. He noticed how the Quaid looked intently down at the city and softly said to himself: “That is the end of it”.
Yet, in two respects at least, it was not the end of his ties with India. He did not change his will whereby Aligarh Muslim University remained one of the principal beneficiaries. Nor did he sell his favourite residence on Mount Pleasant Road in Bombay.
Later, the same day, after the boisterous welcome in Karachi, as the Quaid ascended the steps of the Governor-General’s House, he said to his military adviser and ADC Lt. S.M Ahsan: “Do you know, I never expected to see Pakistan in my lifetime. We have to be very grateful to God for what we have achieved. “ Later still, during the orientation walk through the premises of his new residence, and a meticulous inspection of the inventory, he noted that the library shelves were empty.
He was informed that the previous occupant, the Governor of Sind, had taken all the books with him. Visibly upset, Jinnah said to his military secretary, “Nonsense. The books belong here. Go and get them back”. Similarly, when he was shown game items, he was told that a croquet set had been taken away by Sir Francis Mudie, Governor of Punjab. On his visit to Lahore after some time, he had the set retrieved and returned to where it belonged as state property.
August 9, 1947
At a dinner hosted by Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah in Jinnah’s honour, Mrs Hidayatullah tied an imaam zaamin on the founder’s arm. Surprisingly, he did not know the meaning of the ritual. When told that it would protect him against evil, he turned to Altaf Hussain, the editor of Dawn, and said, “Now I can face you”, to loud laughter.
‘Unforgetting’ & unforgiving?
In his book I was ADC to the Quaid, which was written after his retirement, Group Captain Ata Rabbani recalls an unusual revelation of Jinnah’s traits.
He records that, while proceeding to the Sind Assembly on August 11, 1947 to deliver the address that became a historic landmark of secular vision, the Quaid-i-Azam deliberately ignored the presence of A.K.M Fazlul Haque, the East Bengal leader who had the honour of moving the Lahore Resolution on March 23, 1940 at the Muslim League meeting. Well in advance of coming abreast of the Quaid walking in his direction, Fazlul Haque greeted him several times and also bowed respectfully. Jinnah neither looked at him nor responded to the salutation.
Rabbani wrote: “…The only reason that comes to mind is that (Fazlul Haque, otherwise known for his integrity) had repeatedly acted against the categorical instructions of the League’s high command, at times even at the peril of causing damage to the overall Muslim cause. Disloyalty to the cause was one thing that the Quaid-iAzam would not forgive.”
The final stretch
There was a poignant contrast in the last stretch. Just as Pakistan’s genesis moved towards the triumph of reality, the leader’s already frail body was being eroded from within.
His fragility became increasingly apparent around, and onwards of 1940.
Now in Pakistan, the news poured in every day of ghastly massacres as refugees crossed new state frontiers in Punjab, of anti-Muslim slaughters in New Delhi and Bihar, Indian occupation of Srinagar on a forged Instrument of Accession, severe shortage of funds and resources to cope with enormous new numbers and pressures — all compounded the depressive impact on both mind and physique.
Yet he insisted on reviewing piles of files in detail, made notes, frequently met the prime minister and other senior individuals. And also travelled to Peshawar, Risalpur, Lahore.
Then, defying all advice, he flew from Quetta to Karachi to inaugurate the State Bank on July 1, 1948, his last public appearance.
Both Fatima Jinnah in her slim book and Lt. Colonel Dr Ilahi Bakhsh, who wrote With the Quaid-i-Azam during his last days as he attended to him in the last weeks, narrate moving accounts of how this giant of a man, despite valiant efforts, quickly weakened each day in August and early September 1948. Yet his sense of values survived. When a nurse repeatedly declined to tell him his temperature unless the doctor permitted her, and then left the room, he told his sister: “I like people like that… people who can be firm, who refuse to be cowed down….”
Towards the end of August, Fatima Jinnah recalled him saying: “I am no more interested in living…the sooner I go the better.” When she reassured him that the doctors were hopeful, he said, “No… I don ‘ t want to live.”
The bizarre episode of the ambulance breakdown on September 11, 1948 between Mauripur airfield and the Governor-General’s House is well known.
Frail at birth and in death
Weight count came a full circle.
From cradle to grave. Infected lungs and sheer fatigue had reduced him to only 70 pounds. Yet, when it mattered most, Jinnah punched way above his physical weight.
In every sense, the Quaid-i-Azam remained the unbeaten heavy-weight champion of history. He defeated three adversaries virtually single-handedly — the British, the Congress Party and allies, plus at least four Muslim entities that opposed the creation of Pakistan.
Though well-known, Stanley Wolpert’s distinctive tribute in his book, Jinnah of Pakistan bears repetition: “Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state.
Mohammad Ali Jinnah did all three.”

The day began with special Christmas masses at churches, though celebrations had been underway since mid-December.
Across the country, Christian communities marked the Christmas season by participating in peace rallies, visiting shopping areas and funfairs, and attending specially organised pre-Christmas events.
Below are glimpses of the celebrations in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, captured in the days leading up to the colourful occasion.

Throughout the Gaza conflict that began with Hamas’s raid on Israel in October 2023, a sombre tone marked Chistmases in Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ.
But on Wednesday, celebrations were in full swing again in the occupied West Bank city, as a fragile truce held in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people face the winter living in makeshift tents.
In the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV was due to deliver his first Christmas Mass at 2030 GMT at Saint Peter’s Basilica, after he called for “24 hours of peace in the whole world”.
The US pontiff was elected by fellow cardinals in May following the death of Pope Francis.
He has a more discreet and conciliatory style than his charismatic predecessor, but Leo has followed in Francis’s footsteps on key issues like immigration and social justice.
‘Full of joy’
In Bethlehem, the sound of drums and bagpipes playing renditions of popular Christmas carols filled the air, as Christians, young and old ,made their way down to the city’s central Manger Square.
“Today is full of joy because we haven’t been able to celebrate because of the war,” said Milagros Anstas, 17, dressed in the yellow and blue uniforms of Bethlehem’s Salesian scout group. Hundreds of people took part in the parade down Bethlehem’s narrow Star Street.
A dense crowd massed in Manger Square, while a handful of spectators peered from the balconies of the municipality building to get a view of the festivities below.
A towering Christmas tree covered with red and gold baubles sparkled next to the Church of the Nativity. The basilica dates back to the fourth Century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2000 years ago.
Scout member Katiab Amaya, 18, said the renewed festivities were an important symbol of the Christian community’s presence in the region.
“It gives us hope that there are still Christians here celebrating and we are still keeping the traditions,” she said.
Bethlehem’s municipality chose to tone down Christmas festivities while conflict raged in Gaza — a Palestinian coastal territory geographically separated from the West Bank by Israel.
A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began in October, has halted full-scale conflict in Gaza, but many are still facing a life of misery after losing their homes and loved ones.
Published in Dawn, December 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-25 04:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/694c70463ff3d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963143/education-roundup-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Education roundup 2025</strong></a><br><p>AS another year ends, it is worth looking back and taking stock of significant developments in Pakistan’s education sector. While many small-scale interventions and pilot projects are ongoing, I will restrict my review to wide-scale developments that are more likely to have a perceptible impact, good or bad.
The widely quoted figure of 25 million out-of-school children, the one that prompted this government to announce an “education emergency,” has been bumped up to an estimated 26m. Meanwhile, public spending on education remains stuck at 0.8 per cent of GDP. Instead, according to a news report just this week, the government’s best idea is to gently twist private businesses’ arm to make them pledge one per cent of their profits for the cause of education, presumably because levied taxes (paid or evaded) and additional costs of doing business in this country are not high enough. Never has a country, certainly no country of a quarter billion souls, righted its ship of public education on the back of corporate charitable giving.

 

For a positive development, the national Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC) announced a notable increase in flexibility. SSC and HSSC students will now be able to select individual subjects, instead of being restricted to pre-set tracks, ie arts, (general) science, pre-engineering, and pre-medical, like in many other foreign school systems. Students advancing to HSSC will not be constrained in their choice by what SSC subjects they took, ie anyone who opted for arts subjects at the SSC level could still take subjects needed for admission to medical or engineering programmes. It may require catching up in some subjects, but it will be an option. It is a welcome development, because how certain can we expect 14-year-olds starting SSC or 16-year-olds starting HSSC to be about the future course of their academic year?
A widely debated development is the Punjab government’s ongoing privatisation of a large portion of its 48,000 public schools. So far, the management of 12,500 public primary and middle schools has already been transferred to private entities, primarily education sector NGOs, with another 4,500 announced in the upcoming phase, which, for the first time, will include 70 of the province’s 550 inter colleges. Students at schools with low enrolment have been reassigned to nearby schools. Similarly, teachers have been transferred to other schools or placed in the surplus pool. Unsurprisingly, there is pushback from teacher unions, but schools do not exist solely for the purpose of providing livelihoods for teachers. What we know for certain is that, for decades, most public schools have failed to deliver on their mission of educating children and that successive governments have been unable to reverse the decline. It was high-time for a radical change, and I look forward to seeing the outcome evaluations of this programme.

Never has a country righted its ship of public education on the back of charity.

Sindh has decided to go a different route to deal with its inability to improve public school education and announced the introduction of IGCSE / A-level education tracks in one public school of every district.
A big development that almost was but did not come to pass, but may yet come to be, is the reversal of the devolution of education to provinces. The recentralisation of education as a subject to the centre was mentioned during early negotiations of the 27th Amendment. Speculatively, while it is on the wish list, it was not high up enough on the list of priorities to be included in the ratified version. Now, there are rumours swirling about yet another, a 28th amendment, with the two key priorities of changing the NFC and bringing education back to the centre. While provinces are certainly expected to put up a fight on the issue of the NFC, having accomplished little to nothing in education since the 18th Amendment gave them control, they are expected to be glad for the federal government to take the responsibility of developing curricula off their hands.
Another important development affecting students seeking to study abroad has been the tightening of student visa requirements. Last month, the Institute of International Education’s Fall 2025 snapshot report showed that in the US, enrolment of new international students is down by 17pc over last year. This drop has been attributed to the Trump administration’s changes to student visa rules.
In the UK, similar measures have already led a few universities to suspend or significantly tighten admissions for applicants from Pakistan entirely. The Home Office tracks and limits the rate at which applications for student visas are rejected for every UK university to prevent abuse of the visa system by international students who overstay or apply for asylum. According to revised rules, universities whose student visa application rejections will exceed the 5pc threshold will lose the right to host international students. Since Pakistani students are counted among the biggest offenders, several universities no longer consider applicants from Pakistan. This is a case of bad actors ruining opportunities for all genuine applicants from the country.

 

Any review of education news in 2025 must acknowledge the rapid advancement of AI. Tech execs of companies leading the AI revolution, thought leaders, and leading universities and school systems have not been able to converge on a consensus on how AI tools will be incorporated into learning and how it will change the sector as a whole.
Meanwhile, in several conversations I had with people in the bureaucracy, in their infinite wisdom and foresight, they have already declared that AI-powered learning tools will sweep through schools and universities transforming the education sector as we know it, solving all problems and, having nothing to offer, are happy to fold their arms, lean back, and just watch as passive observers!
In conclusion, what is life without a little conflict, sentimentality, and betrayal of a soap opera? That is why I feel it necessary to acknowledge the low-level hubbub created every time an HEC chair steps down and the horse race of vice-chancellors for the replacement begins. The rumour is that the shortlist has been cut down to three candidates, and the announcement of who is going to be the next HEC chair is imminent. Until next year, we watch, wait, and hope that the next chapter brings more substance than spectacle.

It also signals a restart of the privatisation programme after nearly 20 years in the wilderness, since the Supreme Court halted sale of the steel mills back in 2005.
There are two important questions to raise in connection with this deal. The less-important question is the one that asks whether the government fetched the best deal that it could under the circumstances. The answer here is yes. People who are asking after the “sale price” are missing the point. This is not a kilo of tomatoes or a plot of land that has just been sold. This is a business enterprise whose auditors said more than a decade ago that it is “no longer a going concern.”

 

The company ran losses year after year, averaging around Rs50 billion per year and rising to as high as Rs105bn in recent years. By now its total accumulated losses have grown to beyond Rs650bn. Pakistan could have built a large dam or refurbished a large part of our railway network with this kind of money. There was no sense whatsoever in carrying this enterprise forward any longer. It should have been dumped over a decade ago when its losses were around half this level.
But in privatising it there was a problem. Nobody wants to buy the losses. I had occasion to sit down and speak with former CEOs of PIA over the years, and one thing they all told me was how much of their time is consumed in simply managing the financial sinkhole the company had become. Every week some new loan would be maturing and they spent their time scrambling to arrange a rollover or try to pull money from any source they could to try and make the payment. A company whose senior management spends most of its time scrambling to meet its creditor obligations cannot be turned around.

There was no sense in carrying this enterprise forward any longer. It should have been dumped over a decade ago.

So the government undertook a corporate rearrangement in March 2024 to prepare the company for a sale. All the accumulated losses, which were sitting as debt on the company’s balance sheet, were separated into a holding company, called Holdco. Some of its “non-core properties” like the Scribe or Roosevelt hotels, were also separated.
As a result of this rearrangement PIA reported its first net profit in almost two decades. From a loss of Rs 104bn in 2023, it went to a profit of Rs26bn in 2024. A number of factors were responsible for this sharp swing. Most important was a Rs70bn gain for the company on account of financing cost, since that component of its cost moved to the holding company. After this there was a reduction of Rs18bn in operating cost and a sharp reduction of Rs24bn in exchange rate loss, presumably because in 2023 the company bore the brunt of the devaluation while 2024 saw a more or less stable exchange rate.
This is how the company was prepared for sale, by carving it into separate entities, taking the debts, liabilities and non-core assets and giving them to one, and the “operating assets” (planes, landing slots etc) to another. It was a smart move and there was no other way to do it.
This means the government is still left with the debts of the company, while the investor receives a clean balance sheet upon which to build anew. What has actually been sold, therefore, is a running business with a clean balance sheet, and the prospect of running this business into profitability in the years to come. There is nothing the investor can do with what they have purchased, other than operate it as an airline. They cannot strip down its assets (it hardly has any).
And to hold the buyer to their end of the bargain, the government has required that they take 92.5 per cent of the money they will be bidding for and invest it in the airline itself. So the government only receives 7.5pc of the total bid price, an amount just sufficient perhaps to cover the cost of the deal.
This is how it’s supposed to work. No government can expect to make money out of selling PIA, not when the company has over Rs650bn of accumulated losses on its books. You can either shut the company down altogether, and still be left with all that debt to service and repay, because it was guaranteed by the government. Or you can try and salvage the airline by asking a private investor to take its intangible assets and bid over how much they can commit to invest in it to try and rebuild the airline anew. That’s the path the government opted to take, and it worked.
The second, perhaps more important and certainly more interesting, question is the involvement of Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) in the consortium that is buying the airline. The day after the bidding FFC informed the stock exchange that it intends to join the consortium. The announcement made no mention of how much FFC will contribute towards the Rs135bn that the winning consortium had bid for the airline.
That is interesting for the simple reason that FFC can also be considered a state-owned company, even though technically it’s not classified as such. Regardless of the size of its participation, its presence in the consortium is a sign that what has just happened with PIA is an unconventional privatisation given continuing state-owned stakes. The new consortium gearing up to take ownership of the airline could well usher in a new period of state and business partnerships in the years to come.

Symbolically, it is. Substantively, it is far more complicated because it underscores Pakistan’s economic constraints, low investor interest, bureaucratic resistance to reforms, and public misgivings over the privatisation process.
The government’s disinvestment of its majority stake in the national flag carrier undoubtedly represents a significant breakthrough. This comes nearly five decades after the first Benazir Bhutto administration sold about 8pc of the state’s shareholding in the company through the stock exchange, and follows multiple missed deadlines since and a failed privatisation attempt last year.
It shows how politically and economically fraught privatisation of SOEs, especially entities like PIA and Pakistan Steel Mills, has been. Further, it highlights how frustrating and costly it can be for any administration to generate investor interest in privatisation due to past examples of political victimisation of buyers, frequent policy reversals, transparency issues, judicial interventions etc.
Successful sale apart, the fact remains that PIA could not have been sold without the state first cleaning up its balance sheet by transferring the firm’s legacy liabilities in debt, losses and pension obligations to a holding company, partial write-off, as well as substantial tax concessions, deferred credits and other incentives to sweeten the deal for investors.
The buyers will now get a company with positive equity, four million passengers in annual traffic, and global landing rights. Given this background, it is not surprising that the winning bid of Rs135bn — including the actual sale price of Rs10bn and commitment of capital investment of Rs125bn in the airline’s operations and fleet over the next five years — for 75pc of the current government holding in the airline’s operating assets has raised many an eyebrow.

 

With the total valuation assessed at Rs180bn for the state’s current 92pc stake in the airline, the government expects to receive another Rs45bn in cash from the sale of its remaining stake in the airline. The authorities and many others consider this a good deal for the government, considering it will save billions in future losses. Nonetheless, it isn’t much of a concern for them that taxpayers will continue to pay for PIA’s legacy losses till these are fully liquidated.
The way this transaction has been structured to rope in buyers also belies the claims of restoration of investor confidence in the economy or privatisation. Not a single foreign investor or airline cared to bid for the airline despite the ‘sweetest’ possible deal. Not just that. The winning bidder’s plan to rope in a military-owned fertiliser company, which had bowed out of the competition only days back, seems less for its capital needs than its desire for institutional backing to hedge against unpredictability. Upcoming SOE sales will test whether investor interest exists beyond this deal.

Rahman, 60, an aspiring prime minister who has lived in London since he fled Bangladesh in 2008 over what he called a politically motivated persecution, is due to arrive in Dhaka on Thursday.
Acting chairman of the Bang­la­desh Nationalist Party (BNP), he is expected to take the reins from his ailing mother, 80-year-old former prime minister Khaleda Zia.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the February 12, 2026 elections.
But she was hospitalised soon after that pledge, and she has been in intensive care ever since.
The elections will be the first since a mass uprising last year ended the 15-year hardline rule of Sheikh Hasina, who was at odds with the BNP.
Since Hasina’s fall from power, Rahman has been acquitted of the most serious charge against him: a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally. He had denied the charges.
BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has promised Rahman will “arrive among us on the soil of Dhaka” on Dec 25, which he said will be a “fantastic day”.
Tarique Rahman, often pictured beside his mother on BNP banners, has long been groomed for leadership.
In June, he met in London with Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the interim government until the February elections.
Violent politics
Rahman, known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, carries a political name that has defined his life.
Born in 1967 when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 independence war. The BNP hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”. His father, Ziaur Rahman, was an army commander.
Ziaur Rahman gained influence months after a 1975 coup in which Sheikh Hasina’s father, founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was murdered.
That fuelled lifelong tensions bet­ween the Zia and Hasina families, dubbed the “Battle of the Begums”.
Ziaur Rahman was assassinated when his son was 15. The younger Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit, as Zia went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating her terms in power with Hasina.
Rahman briefly studied international relations at Dhaka University before entering politics at 23, joining the BNP in its fight against military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, according to his party.
Allegations of nepotism
Still, Rahman’s career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and mismanagement.
A 2006 US embassy cable des­cri­bed him as the BNP’s “heir apparent” who “inspires few but unnerves many”.
Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”.
Rahman was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 and claimed he was tortured in custody.
Reports suggested his release was conditional on leaving politics. Freed later that year, he flew to London in 2008 for medical treatment and never returned.
After Hasina swept to power in 2008, her government jailed tens of thousands of BNP members.
In 2018, Rahman was again sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for allegedly orchestrating the 2004 attack on Hasina’s rally.

Sidrah Nosheen, 34, was part of an organised crime group that smuggled heroin from Pakistan into the United Kingdom and supplied it across the country, the NCA said in a statement.
Officers arrested Nosheen at her property on Woodside Road, Wyke, in June 2024. During the operation, they discovered that her back bedroom had been converted into what investigators described as a heroin processing plant.
The NCA said heroin concealed inside items of clothing including leather jackets had been delivered to Nosheen’s address. She would remove the drugs and package them into one-kilo deal bags.
During the search, officers recovered 85kg of the Class A drug in various bags, along with a wallpaper pasting table, weighing scales, buckets and other tools. Boxes containing plastic-wrapped clothing waiting to be opened were also found, as well as debris from boxes that had already been processed.
Phone evidence showed hundreds of messages between Nosheen and an accomplice in Pakistan discussing the supply of heroin to the UK. Investigators also found evidence that she distributed multi-kilogram consignments of drugs to contacts within the UK and, on one occasion, collected £250,000 for the organised crime group from a criminal in Bradford.
Nosheen was due to stand trial at Bradford Crown Court but later changed her plea, admitting conspiracy to supply heroin and conspiracy to import heroin.
She was sentenced on Tuesday.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has called on all sides to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tensions, as the United States continued to interdict vessels off the coast of Venezuela, a situation that drew sharp condemnation from China and Russia at the UN Security Council.
Pakistan’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed the council during a meeting requested by Venezuela. He emphasised that the “current trajectory serves no one’s interest”.







“In a world marred by polarisation with conflicts affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions around the globe, it is all but imperative to once again underscore the centrality and inviolability of the UN Charter and its core principles,” Mr Jadoon said.
He specifically highlighted the prohibition on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
“We firmly believe that the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of states, as enshrined in the UN Charter, are sacrosanct,” Mr Jadoon said.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s position, he noted that while measures to counter transnational organised crime or narcotics trafficking are necessary, they must be cooperative and conform to international law. He urged engaged diplomacy to ensure the region remains a “Zone of Peace”.
The sitting laid bare deep divisions between world powers. US Ambassador Mike Waltz asserted that sanctions would be enforced to the maximum extent to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources used to fund drug cartels.
“The United States will do everything in our considerable power to protect our hemisphere, our borders and the American people,” Waltz said, claiming oil sales enable Maduro’s “narco-terrorist activities.”
However, China and Russia slammed the US actions. Chinese envoy Sun Lei opposed “unilateralism and bullying”, demanding Washington heed the international community and uphold navigation safety.
Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada rejected the US narrative, stating the threat is not drugs or security, but a desire for Venezuela’s oil and land.
“The world knows that, if the scale of armed attacks continues, we will exercise, with all determination, our inalienable right to self-defence,” Moncada said.
UN’s Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari noted that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stands ready to support diplomatic engagement, if requested by both parties.
Council split on Iran
Meanwhile, at another UN debate, Islamabad called for diplomatic engagement to resolve the Iran nuclear issue.
“It is deeply regrettable that in recent months, divisions in the council and beyond have widened, taking us further away from the resolution of the issue,” Ambassador Jadoon told the 15-member council during a discussion on nuclear non-proliferation.







He noted the situation has been complicated by unilateral actions and differing interpretations of the “snapback” mechanism.
The council remains split over the legitimacy of holding meetings regarding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement from which the US withdrew in 2018.
Mr Jadoon cautioned that coercive measures would not bridge the gap and often hurt ordinary citizens.
“We strongly believe that diplomacy and dialogue should be the guiding principles for the resolution of all outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear program,” he said.
He emphasised that the JCPOA framework could still prove useful if parties move forward with compromise. Mr Jadoon urged the restoration of trust in diplomatic engagement and stressed the critical role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying compliance.
The session marked the first meeting since France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions, citing Iran’s non-performance.
Jay Dharmadhikari, France’s deputy permanent representative, warned that Iran’s lack of implementation constitutes a “grave threat”. He added that if brought to military enrichment levels, Iran’s stockpile would be sufficient “to produce 10 nuclear explosive devices”.

Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants.
Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was displayed.

A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.”
The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan.
Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities.
The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk.
Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access.
They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags.
The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities.
“This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said.
Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services.
The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission, consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online.
Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained.
Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication.
Courts in the United States and other countries have sentenced individuals involved in multi-million-dollar phishing and fraud schemes, where victims — often targeted through impersonation and phishing — were defrauded of large sums.
Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.</p><small>2025-12-25 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2507273806b6d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963123/fauji-fertiliser-company-joins-winning-consortium-after-pia-auction' target='_blank'><strong>Fauji Fertiliser Company joins winning consortium after PIA auction</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) on Wednesday decided to join a consortium led by the Arif Habib Corporation Limited, which emerged as the winning bidder for the acquisition of a 75 per cent stake in Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday.
Confirming the development, Arif Habib told Dawn that FFC had joined his consortium and that discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership.
FFC was one of the four bidders for the acquisition of a 75pc stake in PIA, but it withdrew from the bidding process ahead of the submission and opening of bids.
Under the conditions, a bidder that withdraws has the right to join the winning consortium, subject to meeting the criteria set by the Privatisation Commission.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muha­mmad Ali welcomed the move, saying it would strengthen the consortium both financially and in terms of management depth, expertise and global linkages.
“PIA will require a financially and operationally sound consortium if we want to make it a global leader in aviation.
“The participation of Fauji Fertiliser will help in achieving this ambition and is an encouraging development,” he said.
Earlier, during a press conference, Mr Ali described Fauji Fertiliser as a sound and strong group with management expertise and presence.
“If they join, the buyer group will be further strengthened,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: A day after PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated the government’s willingness to engage in a political dialogue, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) exp­ressed its willingness to engage in such a process, albeit conditionally.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
But if the spokesperson for the country’s main opposition party is to be believed, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is not interested in sitting across the table from the government.
A meeting of opposition leaders was held on Wednesday, chaired by PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and attended by Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Sajid Tareen, Asad Qaiser, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, and Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai, among others.







Talking to Dawn, TTAP deputy chief Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that Wednesday’s huddle had resolved to hold talks with the government.
Participants also agreed on the need for a new charter to address the country’s political and financial issues and the spiralling law and order situation, in order to give hope to the despondent masses.
However, it was made clear that the dialogue process must have some clear goals.
“The dialogue will be held for holding the transparent elections in future, appointment of chief elections commissioner with consensus, supremacy of the parliament, rule of law, assurance of human rights, and democratic and constitutional norms,” Mr Khokhar said.

 

He said that Mr Achakzai has also held a meeting with Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, to discuss the proposal with her.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Achakzai had previously assured National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq that all political parties would agree to restore the 1973 Constitution, he would be responsible for making sure that Imran Khan would sign on to the initiative.
PTI stands firm
But taking a diametrically opposite view, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram claimed that the party would steer clear of any negotiations with the federal government on the orders of Imran Khan himself.
Speaking to ARY News a day earlier, Mr Akram – when asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government – categorically said that the party was “not interested”.
“I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ he explained.
However, in the same breath, he clarified that Mr Achakzai or Allama Raja Nasir have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk.
Mr Akram said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks.
The party spokesperson also claimed that the same two men would also decide whether to call for a protest, or not.
“Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said.

ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The controversy surrounding the recently enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 intensified on Wednesday as various lawyers’ associations — irrespective of their political affiliation — endorsed the Lahore High Court’s intervention to suspend its implementation.
Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warraich strongly condemned the statement made by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in which she reportedly sought to justify the law empowering deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
The Punjab chief minister had argued that the law was enacted to provide long-awaited relief to millions of citizens suffering from prolonged land and property disputes.
On Dec 22, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the law and announced that a full bench would be constituted to hear and decide the matter.
The PBC vice chairman stated that the enactment of the law questioned the jurisdiction of patwaris and “unlawfully” empowered assistant commissioners beyond their mandate.
He commended the LHC’s interim order, stating that the new law would dismantle the civil justice system, undermine civil rights and erode judicial supremacy, as it allowed a revenue officer to hand over possession of property in a matter pending before a civil court.
Mr Warraich said the judiciary had the exclusive mandate to interpret laws, and the LHC chief justice was fully competent to pass such an interim order. He added that the legal fraternity stood with the chief justice and the judiciary in support of the ruling against the legislation.
PBC member Ahsan Bhoon, who also heads the Independent Group, urged the chief minister to withdraw her statement regarding the suspension of the law.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he said those who drafted the law and provided flawed advice were responsible for the situation.
Mr Bhoon termed the chief minister’s remarks about the chief justice ‘inappropriate’ and warned that lawyers would take to the streets if the government continued with its actions.

Similarly, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Haroonur Rashid, Secretary Malik Zahid Aslam Awan and the 28th cabinet of the association maintained that the legislation was not only “unconstitutional and unlawful” but also in “conflict” with the Civil Procedure Code, Criminal Procedure Code, Evidence Act and other relevant laws, rendering them ineffective.
The SCBA cabinet appreciated the high court’s interim order suspending the enforcement of the legislation and noted that the LHC chief justice had recognised that it compromised settled legal principles concerning property matters.
“It has established a parallel jurisprudence whereby property disputes are to be resolved by deputy commissioners, district police officers, revenue officers, and other relevant government officials, rather than through judicial proceedings, which by no means is lawful,” the statement read.
The SCBA also expressed grave concern regarding the Punjab government and its chief minister, who allegedly appeared to be surrounded by aides “protecting the interests of land mafia and land grabbers”.
It said it fully endorsed the high court’s decision and extended complete support to the LHC chief justice, adding that criticism of the interim order was unfounded and unnecessary.
The association urged the provincial government to refrain from “implementing the unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.
LHCBA
The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) also welcomed the chief justice’s decision against the property ownership law.
LHCBA President Asif Nissoana, who belongs to the Hamid Khan-led professional group, asked the government to refrain from appeasing land mafias.
‘Full bench’
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench referred a constitutional challenge to the property protection legislation to the LHC chief justice for the constitution of a full bench, observing that identical questions of law were already pending before the court.
Justice Jawad Hassan passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Tariq Mehmood against the Punjab government and others, in which the vires of proceedings initiated by the district administration under the newly enacted law were called into question.
The court was informed that the LHC CJ had already referred an identical matter for adjudication by a full bench.
Consequently, invoking Chapter 3, Part-B, Rule 4-A of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders (Volume V), Justice Hassan referred the present petition to the LHC chief justice for appropriate orders.
During the hearing, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner defended the initiation of proceedings under the law, maintaining that its preamble aimed to protect lawful ownership of immovable property and to provide expeditious remedies against illegal dispossession.
They added that action was being taken under Sections 7, 9, and 10 of the law, including the referral of disputes to a deputy commissioner-led dispute resolution committee and the adoption of preventive measures such as taking surety or sealing property.
However, the counsels for the petitioner argued that the tribunal envisaged under the law had neither been notified nor made functional, rendering all proceedings unlawful.
They also contended that Sections 8(4) and 8(5), which conferred civil court-like powers on dispute resolution committees, were ultra vires the Constitution.
An objection was also raised to the vaguely defined “preventive measures” under Section 9, for which, they said, no proper procedure or remedy had been provided.

ISLAMABAD: The government has approved a pilot electricity auction that will allow power to be bought and sold through competition, while also end­o­r­sing steps towards integrated energy planning a­cross the country to end fragmented decision-making.
In this regard, the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday approved framework guidelines for a “wheeling” auction of 800-megawatt of electricity under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Model (CTBCM).

 

Wheeling refers to the use of the national electricity grid to deliver power from a generator to a buyer. Big factories or companies may buy electricity directly from a producer, but they still need the grid wires to get it. The fee they pay for using those wires is called wheeling and grid charges.
The meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to end future procurement of power generation capacity in the public sector and constituted an 18-member steering committee of federal and provincial bureaucrats to lead integrated energy planning (IEP) — a push to bring electricity, oil, gas and other energy planning under a single coordinated national approach.
Under the framework guidelines, 800MW of generation capacity would be sold through a competitive auction for five years. The quantum would gradually increase after the initial trial, subject to government approval.
The auction is being developed under CTBCM, a system in which power producers and buyers deal directly with each other, rather than the government acting as the main middleman. In plain words, electricity is bought and sold like a market, not fully controlled by the government.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) would determine the wheeling and grid charges for bulk power consumers upon a uniform petition to be filed by the distribution companies under the guidance of the power division.
An indicative wheeling charge of about Rs12.55 per unit may come into force, although industrial consumers are contesting it as too high and rendering their products uncompetitive.
The guidelines require the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO) — a new entity created under the Power Division — to issue the auction process with Nepra’s approval.
ISMO will issue an auction calendar and detailed procedures. The framework does not allow a minimum or maximum limit on bid prices (no “cap” or “floor”), and the bid price is to remain fixed for one year.
The guidelines also delineate the roles and responsibilities for the implementing agencies, including Nepra, ISMO and auction participants, and govern the entire structure of the CTBCM.
Under the timelines agreed with the IMF, approval of these guidelines for auction was targeted for December and approval of uniform wheeling charges by Nepra in January 2026.
An official statement said the resident committee of the top civil-military forum — the Special Investment Facilitation Council — had decided to have an integrated energy plan through federal and provincial coordination under the umbrella of the Power Division of the Ministry of Energy.
“A consequential determination has been reached regarding electricity wheeling within the country, thereby laying the foundation for the inception and advancement of a competitive energy market,” an official statement said, adding that approvals had been extended to the competitive bidding process, participant engagement and other pertinent aspects.
This encompasses auth­or­isation for the CTBCM framework pertaining to electricity auctions, it said, adding that “consistent with the government’s pledges, no further electricity procurement agreements shall be entered into”, formally disengaging the government from electricity procurement activities.
The clearance for IEP governance by the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday would be followed by the notification of an IEP steering committee before the close of the current month.
Next, the cabinet committee will approve IEP’s high-level design by February 2026, to be followed by its model workshops across the country by October 2026, leading to formal approval of the National Integrated Energy Plan (NIEP) by the committee by April 2027.
The IEP steering committee, led by the power minister and co-chaired by the petroleum minister, would comprise about nine federal secretaries, four provincial chief secretaries and the chairpersons of Nepra, Ogra and Wapda.
The committee would ensure wide participation of relevant stakeholders for IEP and facilitate its implementation through the resolution of inter-sectoral, federal and provincial departmental issues and align it with national development priorities, including net-zero transitions.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy also directed the development and institutionalisation of the Energy Information System by the Power Division through its Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) to provide data-based decision-making support to the government, including the “IEP Ecosystem”.
The EIS will cover capacity building, governance improvements, monitoring, policy formulation, integration of plans and policies, modelling and scenario-based planning. It added that planning activities would be executed in a unified manner through a single entity, PPMC.
The NIEP is expected to adopt a cross-sector approach, covering oil, gas, coal, water and hydropower, minerals, natural resources and renewables on the supply side, and residential, commercial, industrial, transport and agriculture needs on the demand side.
The plan is also expected to gradually incorporate an artificial intellgence-based decision-support system to create a “single source of truth” and avoid conflicting figures across institutions.

• Distributes laptops at AJK varsity, urges students to stand for ‘facts & responsibility’
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday directed measures to enhance the capacity of seaports to accelerate trade, connectivity, and economic activity through a reduction in port fees and an end to unnecessary delays.
Chairing a meeting of the ports working group, the premier stated that various departments associated with ports should enhance coordination to facilitate the business community so that cargo dwell time could be reduced among other measures.
A statement by the PM’s Office said that he was presented with recommendations regarding facilities and reforms at ports for the business community. The PM said a transparent system for the auction of abandoned cargo at ports should be introduced, while separate yards should be established at various ports for the same. 
He also said the international companies should be engaged for the task.
The PM said initial testing laboratories for cargo inspection should be established at the ports, adding that unnecessary laboratory testing of cargo should be abolished. He also directed that different types of port charges should be further reduced.
The prime minister directed that dredging and expansion work on all ports should be expedited so that large vessels could be berthed there. He also stressed the improvement of rail connectivity from ports for inland cargo transportation.
During the meeting, the PM was informed that work on the National Ports Master Plan was progressing rapidly and that a port community system had recently been made operational. 
The PM was apprised that an e-bidding system for auctioning abandoned cargo would be introduced soon, enabling all citizens to participate remotely. He was also informed that the port fees were being reduced and bulk cargo fees at Port Qasim were recently slashed by 50 per cent. 
The meeting was informed that tenders for the expansion and dredging of Karachi ports had already been awarded.
Laptop distribution in AJK
In Muzaffarabad, the PM attended a laptop distribution ceremony at the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, saying that investment in youth education and skills was an investment in the future.
Addressing the ceremony as he formally launched the distribution of laptops under the Prime Min­is­ter’s Youth Laptop Programme, the PM said the laptops were a means to connect young people to the world of knowledge and opportunity. 
He urged students to play a positive role in the digital and social media space, cautioning against misinformation and fake news. Truth and falsehood were often shaped by narratives, he said, adding that the educated youth “must stand for facts and responsibility”.
The prime minister also an­­nounced major education initiatives for Azad Jammu and Ka­­shmir, including the approval of four Danish schools, a planned tech-focused Danish university, and the revival of the Prime Minister’s Education Endowment Fund to provide scholarships to talented but underprivileged students from AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan, Baloch­istan and other parts of the country.
He also reaffirmed Pakist­an’s political, moral and diplomatic support for Kash­m­iris and called for unity, hard work and faith to achieve national goals. He said disciplined effort, unity and belief were essential to making Pakistan strong and prosperous.
AJK PM Faisal Mumtaz Rathore said that the laptop programme and new education projects reflected the federal government’s trust in Kashmiri youth and would help them compete nationally and internationally.
UAJK Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Nasir Jamal Khattak said the university was proud to host a ceremony celebrating merit and academic achievement. He said access to technology would enhance research, innovation and learning outcomes for students.

Docks police, in a statement, said that the male victim was gunned down while his wife was shot and injured by her father inside a home near Ayesha Masjid in Machar Colony.
The body and the injured woman were shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi, and further investigation is underway, the statement added. However, the woman passed away during treatment, said Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
South-DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the couple had married of their own free will and had a four-month-old daughter. They had been living in a rented house in Machar Colony for the last five months.
During the initial probe, it emerged that the deceased woman had phoned her father three days ago, Raza said. The father was living with her.
The couple was asleep when the suspect gunned down his son-in-law and injured his daughter and then fled the scene.
The police collected four spent bullet casings from the crime scene, the DIG said.
Earlier in December, a woman and her teenage daughter were stabbed to death over “honour” in the Gizri area of Karachi.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-12-24 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24200445b55f7f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962998/punjab-assembly-passes-kite-flying-regulation-bill' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly passes kite flying regulation bill</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Thursday passed the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, with a majority vote, introducing a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite flying across the province to protect human life and property.
The bill, which cleared the assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on December 15, proposed a near-total ban on kite-flying, except on specific days and designated locations across the province, with strict penalties to curb fatal accidents and property damage.
The bill will now be sent to the governor for his signature to make it an act of the provincial assembly.
Under the new regulations, the use of metallic wire, nylon string, and chemically or glass-coated kite strings has been completely banned. It prescribes strict punishments for flying, manufacturing, storing, or selling kites without permission.
According to the bill, violating the restrictions on kite flying may result in imprisonment ranging from three to five years, a fine of up to Rs2 million, or both.
Manufacturing or selling kites and prohibited strings carries even harsher penalties, including five to seven years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs5m.
In cases where children are found violating the law, action will be taken under the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018. If fines imposed on minors are not paid, authorities will be empowered to recover the amount from parents or legal guardians as arrears.
The offences under the law have been declared non-bailable and cognizable.
Deputy commissioners have been authorised to grant conditional permission for kite flying on specified days and at designated locations. During permitted kite flying, mandatory safety measures for motorcyclists will be enforced.
It further makes registration compulsory for the manufacturing and sale of approved kites and strings. Selling kites or permitted equipment without registration may result in imprisonment from one to five years, a fine, or both.
Police have also been empowered to make arrests without a warrant in such cases. Officers with the rank of sub-inspector or above have been authorised to conduct searches and seize prohibited material.
The bill added that the provincial government may also grant arrest and search powers to other agencies and a formal mechanism has been introduced for the registration and cancellation of kite flying associations, with deputy commissioners empowered to revoke registrations in case of violations.
It also provides a multi-tier right of appeal at the magistrate, deputy commissioner, and commissioner levels. It includes a provision for rewarding informers with up to Rs5,000 for reporting violations.
The new legislation repeals the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2001 and grants the government full authority to frame rules, regulations, and guidelines for the effective implementation of the law.
As per the rules, which were notified last Sunday, kite manufacturers, traders or sellers of authorised kite flying material must apply to the DC and provide specified documents.
Kite flying associations can also register themselves with the DCs concerned through an online application by the association president or general secretary.
The DCs must verify the contents of applications and documents within 10 days of receiving them. Upon verification, the DC shall decide the application and issue a certificate of registration having a one-year validity.
Specifications for permitted kites were also shared. A ‘patang’ shall not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length, while a ‘gudda’ cannot exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
‘Dor’ (string) must be made of cotton with not more than nine threads and no less than 28 counts. The string must be wound in the shape of a ball, since spools are prohibited.
The Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. It was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.</p><small>2025-12-24 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24184832e235916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962993/pcb-receives-12-bids-for-two-new-psl-franchises' target='_blank'><strong>PCB receives 12 bids for two new PSL franchises</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday announced that it has received an “exceptional and encouraging” response to its tender for the sale of two new franchises of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), with 12 parties submitting bids within the stipulated deadline.
This comes after the bidding deadline was extended multiple times — initially from December 15 to December 22, and further to December 24 — amid growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond, following promotional roadshows in London and New York.
The development marks a significant step in the league’s expansion to eight teams from the 2026 season — its first major restructuring since the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018 brought the total to six franchises.
According to the PCB, the bidders hail from five countries — the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan — underscoring the league’s growing global footprint and commercial appeal.
Pakistan-based solar power company Inverex Power Solution, a long-time sponsor of the PSL, also confirmed on Wednesday that it will be bidding for one of the two new franchises.
Reports suggest other interested parties include telecom companies, real estate groups, and consortia involving US-based Pakistani businessmen.
The PCB said the outcome of the initial phase of the bidding process will be announced on December 27. In the next stage, bidders who meet the technical requirements will be invited to take part in an open competition bidding process for the acquisition of the two new teams.
This phase is scheduled to be held on January 8 at the Islamabad Convention Centre.
The PCB reiterated its commitment to conducting the entire process in a transparent and competitive manner, in line with international standards, with the aim of ensuring the sustained expansion and long-term growth of the PSL.
The expansion follows the conclusion of the original 10-year franchise agreements after the 2025 edition, during which five of the existing six teams — Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators — renewed their rights under revised valuations conducted by Ernst & Young.
The status of Multan Sultans remains unresolved amid ongoing disputes.
The successful bidders for the new teams will select from a shortlist of cities including Hyderabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Sialkot.
The 11th edition of the PSL is scheduled to run from March 26 to May 3, 2026, overlapping with the Indian Premier League, in the April-May window aimed at improving overseas player availability.
The tournament will feature a revised format to accommodate the eight teams within a 39-day period, with matches potentially spread across additional venues including Faisalabad.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/242011575187a2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962991/russia-plans-a-nuclear-power-plant-on-the-moon-within-a-decade' target='_blank'><strong>Russia plans a nuclear power plant on the moon within a decade</strong></a><br><p>Russia plans to put a nuclear power plant on the moon in the next decade to supply its lunar space programme and a joint Russian-Chinese research station, as major powers rush to explore the earth’s only natural satellite.
Ever since Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go into space in 1961, Russia has prided itself as a leading power in space exploration, but in recent decades it has fallen behind the United States and, increasingly, China.
Russia’s ambitions suffered a massive blow in August 2023 when its unmanned Luna-25 mission smashed into the surface of the moon while attempting to land, and Elon Musk has revolutionised the launch of space vehicles - once a Russian speciality.
Is that a nuclear reactor on the moon?
Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, said in a statement that it planned to build a lunar power plant by 2036 and signed a contract with the Lavochkin Association aerospace company to do it.
Roscosmos did not say explicitly that the plant would be nuclear but it said the participants included Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom and the Kurchatov Institute, Russia’s leading nuclear research institute.
Roscosmos said the purpose of the plant was to power Russia’s lunar programme, including rovers, an observatory and the infrastructure of the joint Russian-Chinese International Lunar Research Station.
“The project is an important step towards the creation of a permanently functioning scientific lunar station and the transition from one-time missions to a long-term lunar exploration programme,” Roscosmos said.
The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, said in June that one of the corporation’s aims was to put a nuclear power plant on the moon and to explore Venus, known as earth’s “sister” planet.
The moon, which is 384,400 km (238,855 miles) from our planet, moderates the earth’s wobble on its axis, which ensures a more stable climate. It also causes tides in the world’s oceans.
US also plans a reactor on the moon
Russia is not the only one with such plans. NASA in August declared its intent to put a nuclear reactor on the moon by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030.
“We’re in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy,” US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said in August, when asked about the plans.
He added that the United States was currently behind in the race to the moon. He said energy was essential to allow life to be sustained on the moon and thence for humans to get to Mars.
International rules ban putting nuclear weapons in space but there are no bans on putting nuclear energy sources into space - as long as they comply with certain rules.
Some space analysts have predicted a lunar gold rush: NASA says there are estimates of a million tonnes of Helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on earth, on the moon.
Rare earth metals - used in smartphones, computers and advanced technologies - are also present on the moon, including scandium, yttrium and the 15 lanthanides, according to research by Boeing.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24180136968d173.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962988/4-children-injured-in-quadcopter-attack-in-kps-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>4 children injured in quadcopter attack in KP’s Kurram</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least four children were injured in the Gondalabad area of Kurram district on Wednesday after a quadcopter attack, said official sources.
For months, militants in the region have used quadcopters to drop explosives on security forces and the current year has seen an increase in such attacks.
In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources.
The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment.
Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”.
“Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added.
An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack.
Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children.
Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu.
Also in December, at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground in Lakki Marwat.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2419173588af668.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962990/military-top-brass-says-no-malicious-interest-political-or-otherwise-will-be-tolerated' target='_blank'><strong>Military top brass says no malicious interest, political or otherwise, will be tolerated</strong></a><br><p>The military’s top brass on Wednesday vowed that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity would be tolerated, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
These remarks were made at the 273rd Corps Commanders’ Conference, which was convened at General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi and chaired by Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The forum categorically rejected the nexus between terrorism, crime, and vested political interests,” the ISPR’s statement read.
“It resolved that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity, security and stability would be tolerated, nor would anyone be allowed to create divisions between the Armed Forces and the people of Pakistan.”
Paying tribute to security personnel martyred in counter-terrorism operations and civilians who “laid down their lives in recent terrorist incidents”, the forum noted that Pakistan’s gradual progress towards stability, greater opportunities and respect was the product of a joint effort by the government, the military and law enforcement agencies (LEAs).

The army high command also conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment, with particular emphasis on evolving threats and operational preparedness.
“The participants reaffirmed that all terrorists under the tutelage of Indian sponsors, along with their facilitators and abettors, would be dealt with decisively and without exception,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the participants also appreciated the Balochistan Special Development Initiatives, which the ISPR said in the statement are “directed towards local empowerment and social engagements to address challenges of terrorism related to governance”.
“The participants noted the need for similar public-centric initiatives elsewhere, also in line with [the] National Action Plan, to ensure enduring peace and stability,” the statement read.
The ISPR further said that the forum reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Kashmiri and Palestinian self-determination, additionally calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, uninterrupted humanitarian access and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.
“In his concluding remarks, the COAS and CDF directed commanders to maintain the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, training, physical fitness, technological innovations and battlefield adaptability,” the statement read.
“He expressed full confidence in Pakistan Army’s capability to effectively counter [the] complete spectrum of threats, ranging from conventional and sub-conventional to hybrid and asymmetric challenges, while steadfastly safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><small>2025-12-24 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2418271362c77d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962989/un-expert-decries-bushra-bibis-detention-urges-communication-with-lawyers-family' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Bushra Bibi’s detention; urges communication with lawyers, family</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations (UN) expert on Wednesday warned that Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, is being “detained in circumstances that could pose a serious risk to her physical and mental integrity”.
Bushra is serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case, which revolved around the purchase of an expensive jewelry set gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during his May 2021 visit.
“The state has an obligation to protect Mrs. Khan’s health and ensure conditions of detention compatible with human dignity,” Alice Jills Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur, said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
Earlier in May, the Adiala prison administration submitted a detailed report to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), stating that Bushra was receiving a range of special facilities at the prison, with accommodation provided to her under the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978, including medical care, private lodging, and access to entertainment and legal resources.
According to the report, Bushra had been afforded amenities aimed at ensuring her “health, comfort, and legal rights”.
Bushra has access to a dedicated woman medical officer who conducts twice-daily health checks. She has also been provided with a private, spacious room equipped with a cot, mattress, furniture, and climate-control measures such as ceiling fans and an air cooler during summer, the report added.
The UN special rapporteur added that the “conditions and locations of detention must take into account the age, sex and health circumstances of detainees”.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Edwards claimed that Bushra was “frequently placed in near-total isolation for more than 22 hours a day, sometimes for periods exceeding ten days, without access to exercise, reading material, legal counsel, family visits, or her personal physicians.”
The UN expert further urged the authorities to ensure that the former first lady could “communicate with her lawyers, receive visits from family members, and have meaningful human contact throughout her detention.”
Earlier this month, the same UN special rapporteur warned that Imran was being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.</p><small>2025-12-24 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2024/12/250740045519a2d.jpg?r=074013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1880906/what-jinnah-thought-of-civil-liberties-and-the-right-to-a-fair-trial' target='_blank'><strong>What Jinnah thought of civil liberties and the right to a fair trial</strong></a><br><p>This article was originally published on December 25, 2024. It has been replugged.

It’s a fickle thing, the public memory — in what it chooses to remember, and what it wishes to forget. It’s worse still on days like these, where everyone invokes the founder’s name and cites his message without actually understanding it, or what he stood for. After all, the act of forgetting is a statement of its own.
Because Muhammad Ali Jinnah is a problem for today’s Pakistan. He’s too liberal for the right, too nationalist for the left, too civilian for the generals, and too much of a merit hire for the dynasts. Wouldn’t it be best, then, to leave the gent on a pedestal that’s too high to reach?
But if the founder remains confined to portraits and postage stamps, it’s come with a cost: our now perma-crisis is the logical outcome of shirking his ideas for years. It’s also why a core aspect of his life has been suppressed so well: Jinnah as parliamentarian.
Enter the Rowlatt Act
The Quaid ranked among the greatest lawmakers of his generation; in a land that increasingly sees the law as a force for coercion, that fact has faded from view. But reading Jinnah in today’s Pakistan — amid the 26th amendment as well as military trials of civilians — is no less than instructive.
For our purposes, we’ll revisit one of the earliest and most powerful speeches of his career: on the right to fair trial and due process in 1919. As the chaos of the first World War died down, India hoped for its liberties to be restored. What it got was the opposite: the all-out repression of the Rowlatt Act — emergency trials and arrests without cause.
In making their case, the British raged about low conviction rates in ordinary courts, how it was impossible to cope with agitations ‘under the normal law’, and how the protesters’ aim was to promote an uprising against the government.

 

The forces of anarchy were allowed ‘unrestricted license to prosecute their designs’, said crusty Home Member Sir William Vincent.
Up against such colonisers was Jinnah in the Imperial Legislative Council at Delhi. As India convulsed with protests, Jinnah said on September 23, 1918, “Surely it cannot be said that all of a sudden these men became regular criminals. The cause is this, my Lord, that there is discontent; there is dissatisfaction; there is unrest. Might I say, my Lord, that it is partly, if not wholly, due to your policy.”
Yes, India was aflame with riots, but the problem was born of an unfeeling regime and lack of representation — and the Rowlatt Bill “was a wrong remedy for the disease”.
Said the Quaid, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary, and I would rather even that these offences be tried in a summary way by judicial tribunals, because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.”
A stark warning
Well over a century ago, Jinnah was against displacing the judges for the state. More the pity that our members so recently saw fit to pass the horror show of the 26th amendment — the Quaid was clearer about the rule of law in 1918 than many that took oath under his portrait in 2024.
Which brings us to his main address on February 6, 1919 — what editors Malik Mohammad Jafar and I A Rehman would call one of the most glorious chapters of his long career.
“My Lord, to any man who believes in law and justice, these measures seem abhorrent and shocking … my first ground [for opposition] is this, that it is against the fundamental principles of law and justice, namely, that no man should lose his liberty or be deprived of his liberty without a judicial trial in accordance with the accepted rules of evidence and procedure.”
A forensic takedown followed: “… My third ground is that the powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused … Fourth … there is no precedent or parallel that I know of, in any other civilised country, where you have laws of this character enacted.”
And to what end? “… You may be able to get hold of more real offenders but … at the cost of many other innocent men who will be persecuted and who will have no chance, no opportunity, of a proper trial.”
Ultimately, if such a brutal law were passed, “you will create in this country, from one end to the other, a discontent and agitation, the like of which you have not witnessed, and it will have, believe me, a most disastrous effect upon the good relations that existed between the government and the people.”
Jinnah came to the crux: “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.”
To be clear, this wasn’t some soapbox speech. When his warnings went unheeded, and Lord Chelmsford, India’s governor-general, pushed the emergency bill through, Jinnah stayed true to himself — he resigned from parliament as soon as the vote was announced in March 1919.
He would write to Chelmsford, “The constitutional rights of the people have been violated at a time when there is no real danger to the state, by an overfretful and incompetent bureaucracy which is neither responsible to the people nor in touch with real public opinion.”
Jinnah continued, “I can be of no use to my people in the Council, nor consistently with one’s self-respect is cooperation possible with such a government … a government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilised government.”
Applying the Quaid’s principles today
All this would be helpful to reflect on today: the founder’s views on liberty, on judicial trials as a right, on not replacing judges with the executive, on civil unrest as a political problem. Not least, he underscored his words with action — quitting a parliament that passed ugly bills via non-representatives (the Indian members were unanimously opposed to the Rowlatt Act).
Interestingly enough, Mr Jinnah’s 1919 speech would be revived almost a hundred years later in 2015 — in District Bar Association, Rawalpindi vs Federation, the Supreme Court would allow military courts to try terrorists.

 

In the minority were two future chief justices, Jawwad S Khawaja and Qazi Faez Isa. Siding with Justice Khawaja’s dissent (“… I am in complete agreement with his opinion”), Justice Isa cited Jinnah’s 1919 address to hold, “The Constitution does not permit trials of civilians by the military as it would contravene fundamental rights …”
But when military trials of civilians returned in 2023, it would be the retired Justice Jawwad S Khawaja, who fulfilled the spirit of the Quaid’s speech — challenging the trials before the Supreme Court. By contrast, when the same case was fixed, Justice Isa, still serving, stormed off the bench and refused to hear the matter.
As it turns out, Pakistan’s founding ideals have to be fought for every single day. Or, as the Quaid summed up back then, “My Lord, it is no use shirking the issue, it is no use hedging round the whole of this question.”
For a brief moment in time, the Supreme Court’s five-member bench had answered that question with courage — striking down the very provision that allowed for civilians to be court-martialed.
Not that this lasted: the judgment has since been suspended in appeal. Yet whatever the new ‘constitutional bench’ may decide, one fact is imperishable: the original verdict remains true to the Quaid’s address. May he be heard more often.

This will be the second time the Emirati president will visit Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip, according to the FO, will be his first official visit as president.
According to the statement, President Al-Nahyan will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations between both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.







Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-24 12:59</small></div><hr>
