<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/16102746606e055.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931182/aurangzeb-accelerates-rollout-of-social-impact-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb accelerates rollout of social impact projects</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday directed ministries and partner organisations to fast-track the launch of three flagship social impact initiatives — subsidised energy-efficient fans, a skills development bond, and a national small farmer credit scheme — expected to be unveiled by the prime minister in the coming weeks.
The initiatives aim to deliver tangible outcomes across energy efficiency, youth employment, and agricultural finance, and will be implemented in close coordination with regulators, financial institutions, and technical partners.
The first initiative — the Fan Replacement Programme — will offer affordable Islamic financing for replacing existing ceiling fans with energy-efficient models through a fully digital process. An online portal will facilitate customer onboarding, loan applications, fan selection from approved manufacturers, and repayment.
 
 

The government has earmarked Rs2 billion for the programme to gradually replace 88 million (60 per cent) of the 147 million old fans installed across the country.
Over 10 years, the shift is projected to generate peak energy savings of 6,000-7,000MW and reduce capacity charges against the cooling load, which reaches 11,000MW during summer months.

Initiatives include 10-year energy-saving fan programme, first skills impact bond, and uncollateralised digital loans for small farmers

Loans will be provided at the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) plus 2pc, with a 10pc first-loss government guarantee. Repayments will be recovered via electricity bills using an on-bill financing mechanism implemented by distribution companies (Discos), K-Electric, and the Power Information Technology Company (PITC). Punjab IT Board (PITB) will manage digital onboarding using real-time data access provided by PITC.
With an average net replacement cost of Rs10,500 per fan, payback periods will range from 6 to 18 months depending on the financing mode. The programme will initially target 22 million consumers with compliant payment histories.
Bond for skill development
The second initiative — the Pakistan Skills Impact Bond (PSIB) — will be the country’s first outcomes-based financing instrument and is described as a “trailblazer” in attracting both domestic and international capital. Developed under a $3.5 million foreign-funded pilot, the PSIB will fund skill development linked to employment outcomes.
He said the bond would set a precedent for innovative financing and attract outcome funders globally. All impact financing will align with six national priority pillars and contribute to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
 
 

The third programme — the National Subsistence Farmers Support Scheme (NSFSS) — will enable uncollateralised digital loans for small farmers owning or cultivating up to 12.5 acres, including tenants. Using agronomy-related satellite data from the Land Information and Management System (LIMS), banks will incorporate this data into credit scoring to extend input financing at reasonable markup rates.
The State Bank of Pakistan, in collaboration with commercial banks and the Pakistan Banks’ Association, will operationalise the scheme through a centralised portal managed by PITB, offering a fully digital customer journey.
The finance minister noted that this would be the first time space technology is used to drive agricultural credit decisions on a national scale. With 97pc of farmers falling under the 12.5-acre category, the initiative is expected to significantly improve rural livelihoods, enhance productivity, and advance financial inclusion.
He urged all stakeholders to expedite final preparations, stressing that timely delivery would signal the government’s efficiency and commitment to improving citizens’ lives.

With damage assessment in progress, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said seven houses were destroyed and 38 were damaged in the province, mostly in the Swat district. It also reported the destruction of three schools and damage to three.
The PDMA said that the rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province.
 
 

Deaths and damage to infrastructure were recorded in Swat, Buner, Shangla, Bajaur, Lower Dir, Battagram and Mansehra districts.
Meanwhile, the KP government declared one-day mourning on Saturday (today) to honour the five crew members of the Mi-17 helicopter who embraced martyrdom when the aircraft crashed during a rescue operation.

PDMA says rainfall to continue until 21st; govt announces one-day mourning to honour helicopter crash victims

According to a notification issued by the administration department, the national flag will be flown at half-mast across the province as a mark of respect.
The Rescue 1122 teams shifted 2,071 stranded people, including 300  schoolchildren, to safety in Buner district following heavy rainfall and  flash floods.
Deputy commissioner Kashif Qayyum said that an emergency had been declared across the district as relief efforts continued in the calamity-hit areas.
“Helicopters are being used to carry out rescue operations in remote and inaccessible regions,” he said.
Mr Qayyum said that floodwaters had submerged Pir Baba Bazaar and its neighbourhood, while a mosque in Gokand was destroyed and a large number of animals perished.
Also, several roads were blocked.
 
 

Officials said the number of people, who went missing during the flooding, would be known only after waters receded.
In Mansehra, police rescued seven tourists stranded in the upper parts of Kaghan Valley. They had visited Simicsar Lake but were trapped by rain and landslides.
Rains lashed the district throughout the day, dangerously swelling the Indus, Siren and Kunhar rivers along with their tributaries.
The district administration banned tourist visits to the Siren Valley.
Landslides and uprooted trees blocked the Nawazabad and Batrasi roads, which police later cleared for traffic.
 


Meanwhile, passengers and tourists travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan were stranded in Upper Kohistan after the local administration restricted movement on the Karakoram Highway in the Uchar Nullah area due to high water levels in the Indus River.
Abbottabad city was badly hit as almost all main roads were inundated, creating flood-like conditions throughout the area. The most affected arteries were PMA Kakul Road, Mirpur Mandian Road, Supply Road, Karakoram Highway, Sethi Masjid Road, Iqbal Road, Banda Dalazak, Banda Khair Ali Khan Road, Trakana, and the Link Road near Ciena Laboratory.
Most drainage systems were clogged, leading to rainwater overflowing onto the streets and entering houses to damage goods.
Traffic remained paralysed for hours, especially on the KKH in front of Ayub Teaching Hospital where swift floodwaters swept away several vehicles. Some vehicles broke down due to accumulated mud and debris.
Meanwhile, more than 25 tourists along with their vehicles got stranded in Shahi area due to high water flow on the other side of Kambat and Shahi areas of Lower Dir.
They were evacuated by personnel of the Frontier Corps 181 Wing, Rescue 1122 and the district administration.
Meanwhile, several link roads in Lower Dir remained blocked due to landslides triggered by heavy rain. Candidates for teaching posts in Talash and other areas struggled to reach examination centres.
Traffic was suspended near Gulabad Bazaar at Safruno after floodwaters damaged the road.
Heavy rainfall and flash floods severely damaged the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132kv grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electricity transmission across the region. The feeder supplying power to Malam Jabba was also submerged, causing extensive damage.
The flash floods washed away several electricity poles and transformers.
On the instructions of federal power minister Awais Ahmad Laghari, the Peshawar Electric Supply Company began efforts to restore power supply.
It deployed additional workforce to expedite the rehabilitation process and dispatched transformers, poles, cables and heavy machinery to support field operations.

After an abrupt ending to three hours of talks with aides, Trump and Putin offered warm words but took no questions from reporters — highly unusual for the media-savvy US president.
“We’re not there yet, but we’ve made progress. There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said.
He called the meeting “extremely productive” with “many points” agreed, although he did not offer specifics.
“There are just a very few that are left, some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.
 


Putin also spoke in general terms of cooperation in a joint press appearance that lasted just 12 minutes.
“We hope that the understanding we have reached will … pave the way for peace in Ukraine,” Putin said.
As Trump mused about a second meeting, Putin smiled and said in English: “Next time in Moscow.”
The former KGB agent quickly tried to flatter Trump, who has voiced admiration for the Russian leader in the past.
 


Putin told Trump he agreed with him that the Ukraine war, which Putin ordered, would not have happened if Trump were president instead of Joe Biden.
Trump, for his part, again complained of a “hoax” that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 election — a finding backed by US intelligence.
Before the summit, Trump had warned of “severe consequences” if Russia did not accept a ceasefire.
But when asked about those consequences during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity after the talks, Trump said that “because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”.
 






Putin warns Western allies
The friendly reception contrasted with Trump’s berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he met him at the White House in February.
Trump earlier said he sought a three-way meeting with Zelensky but did not announce one at the summit.
Trump said he would now consult Zelensky as well as Nato leaders, who have voiced unease about the US leader’s outreach to Putin.
“Now it’s really up to President Zelensky to get it done,” Trump said in the Fox News interview after the summit.
Putin warned Ukraine and European countries to “not create any obstacles” and not “make attempts to disrupt this emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigues”.
Trump invited Putin just a week ago and ensured there was some carefully choreographed drama for their first in-person meeting since 2019.
The two leaders arrived in their respective presidential jets and descended on the tarmac of an air base, with Trump clapping as Putin appeared.
 


US military might was on display with a B-2 stealth bomber flying overhead, as a reporter shouted audibly to Putin, “Will you stop killing civilians?”
Putin, undaunted, grinned widely as Trump took the unusual step of escorting him into “The Beast”, the secure US presidential limousine, before a meeting in a room before a screen that said — in English only — “Pursuing Peace”.
Putin smiled and joked with Russian reporters on the visit, a landmark for a leader who is facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court related to the Ukraine war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.

Battlefield gains
Russia, in recent days, has made battlefield gains that could strengthen Putin’s hand in any ceasefire negotiations, although Ukraine announced, as Putin was flying in, that it had retaken several villages.
Trump had insisted he would be firm with Putin, after coming under heated criticism for appearing cowed during a 2018 summit in Helsinki.
While he was travelling to Alaska, the White House announced that Trump had scrapped a plan to see Putin alone and he instead held the talks alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his roving envoy Steve Witkoff.
Zelensky was not included and has refused pressure from Trump to surrender territory seized by Russia.
“It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky said in a social media post.
 





</p><small>2025-08-16 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1609115761ee515.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931206/delays-in-deciding-cases-erode-public-trust-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Delays in deciding cases erode public trust: SC</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday expressed deep concern over delays in adjudication across all tiers of the judiciary, warning that such tendencies erode public confidence, undermine the rule of law, and disproportionately harm the weak and vulnerable who cannot afford prolonged litigation.
“Delay in adjudication carries severe macroeconomic and societal consequences: it deters investment, renders contracts illusory, and weakens the institutional legitimacy of the judiciary,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
Justice Shah made the observation while heading a two-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ay­esha A. Malik, which was hearing an appeal filed by Abdul Salam Khan challenging the Peshawar High Court’s Nov 3, 2021 rejection of his plea.
The judge suggested introducing age-tracking protocols to automatically identify dormant cases, along with the judicious use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to assist in scheduling and triage, while preserving judicial discretion.

Justice Shah warns slow adjudication carries severe economic and societal consequences

“Such a system must, at a minimum, ensure: the early fixing of cases on a non-discriminatory basis; the elimination of “queue-jumping” and preferential scheduling; and the prioritisation of matters involving constitutional, economic, or national importance without compromising the timely resolution of individual claims,” Justice Shah emphasised.
The case arose from a challenge to the auction of an immovable property by a bank in execution of a money decree dated April 26, 2010. The auction was held in 2011. The petitioner filed objections the same year, which were dismissed. An appeal before the PHC remained pending for ten years, culminating in the 2021 decision. The matter reached the Supreme Court in 2022 and was taken up now, three years later, in 2025.
 
 

The court noted that the issue was not limited to the validity of the auction but extended to whether any meaningful relief could be granted after 14 years. Even if the petitioner’s claim had merit, the sands of time have all but eroded its potency, Justice Shah remarked.
Though the Supreme Court also rejected the appeal, it observed that a justice system’s credibility rests not only on the fairness of its decisions but also on the timeliness of those decisions. The matter, it noted, was not merely administrative but constitutional, with the right to access to justice guaranteed by articles 4, 9, and 10A of the Constitution.
This right, the court said, encompassed a fair and timely trial, and delays that render a remedy ineffective amount to a denial of due process.
“Justice, to be real, must be both just and timely,” Justice Shah stressed, adding that statistics speak for themselves.
Over 2.2 million cases are currently pending before courts across the country, including about 55,941 in the Supreme Court alone, despite the increase in the number of judges to 24.
These figures are not abstract; they represent disputes suspended in time. Delay in adjudication is not merely a by-product of docket congestion or lower-level inefficiencies but a deeper, structural challenge of judicial governance, Justice Shah said. The judiciary, as a matter of institutional policy and constitutional responsibility, must urgently move toward a modern, responsive, and intelligent case management framework.
The judgement noted that judicial systems worldwide have shown that delay is not an intractable inevitability but a solvable institutional challenge. Countries such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Estonia, Canada, China, Denmark, and Australia have implemented reforms combining technology, structural innovation, and procedural discipline to reduce backlog and improve efficiency.
Through tools such as e-filing, real-time dashboards, automated scheduling, and transparent digital oversight, these jurisdictions have evolved from passive custodians of dockets to active managers of justice delivery, the judgement said.
 
 

These international experiences underscore a basic truth: delays in justice are not inevitable; they are the product of institutional design and can be remedied with vision, planning, and resolve, it added.
Pakistan’s judiciary must draw upon these global lessons and commit to transformative reforms integrating technological innovation, administrative restructuring, and disciplined case management, so that courts become engines of timely, transparent, and citizen-focused justice, Justice Shah observed.

A two-judge bench of BHC, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Halimi, issued the directives while hearing a petition challenging the government’s shutdown orders.
The petition was filed by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of the Balochistan Consumer Civil Society.
The Additional Chief Secretary for Home Muhammad Hamza Shafqat informed the court that public transport services were temporarily suspended.
The court found this justification for halting public transport services to be unreasonable and ordered the immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.
 
 

Regarding the mobile network shutdown, scheduled to last until Aug 31, the court instructed the government to reconsider its province-wide ban. The bench directed officials to restore services in all areas where specific security threats do not exist.
During the hearing, additional chief Secretary (home) and Advo­cate General (AG) Adnan Basharat acknowledged that security threats were concentrated in certain areas, not the entire province.
The hearing was adjourned until Aug 21.

• Minarets of worship places torn down, one set ablaze; nearby homes also attacked
• HRCP calls for strict action on hate speech
LAHORE: Dijikot police have registered two cases against 300 people on terrorism charges for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad, on the eve of Independence Day.
As many as 47 men were nominated, while 300 others remain unidentified in both cases. The cases were registered under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and sections 295, 425, 446, 380, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
According to the FIRs, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. The attackers gathered outside one of the larger Ahmadi worship places and pelted it with bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
The mob, under the cover of Independence Day processions, delivered hate speeches and incited violence against the Ahmadiyya community. At 275-Kartarpur, they targeted two Ahmadi worship places, tearing down the minarets and completely setting on them ablaze. These worship places had been built before 1984.
The attackers also targeted nearby Ahmadi homes, hurling stones that shattered windows and terrified families, injuring several residents.
Ahmadiyya community spokesperson Aamir Mahmood condemned the attacks, stating that community members had been celebrating Independence Day when the mob struck. “This is not the freedom Pakistan’s founders envisioned. Until those who commit such acts face justice, intolerance will grow. Authorities must act swiftly to protect all citizens,” he said.
He demanded strict action against the people involved in the attack and called for adequate protection for the Ahmadiyya community.
Faisalabad City Police Officer Sah­ibzada Bilal Omer was not available for comment.
 
 

However, another police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that 25 people had been arrested in the case and efforts were underway to arrest the rest.
The police official did not reveal the names of the arrested persons and confirm whether they were among the nominated suspects.
Just a day ago,  the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had deplored the recent derogatory remarks made by a cleric against places of worship belonging to non-Muslim communities, including Christians.
“We urge the state to ensure accountability for hate speech in all its forms by implementing the 2014 Supreme Court judgement and call on civil society to reject narratives that endanger peaceful coexistence and equal citizenship,” the statement concluded.

I listen studiously.
Bilgrami is a woman of many talents and, after her curatorial success at the Expo 2020 in Dubai, which resulted in the much-lauded Pakistan Pavilion bagging the Silver Award, she is now at the helm of Pakistan’s latest endeavour at the newest iteration of the Expo. The question is: can she capture lightning in a bottle twice?
She tells me two things. One: try to experience the Pakistan Pavilion at a leisurely pace, before the swathes of visitors arrive. Two: appreciate the Japanese people and their way of life. This second instruction is easy enough to follow.
They say that if you ask a Japanese person for directions, they’ll walk you to your destination instead of simply pointing the way. I experience this first-hand shortly after hopping off the train at Yumeshima Island — the location of the Expo 2025 Osaka — as I’m diligently shepherded through the crowd by an excessively courteous volunteer.
Undeniably, the most awe-inspiring aspect of the expansive Expo is the Grand Ring — an enormous, continuous wooden structure that encircles the site’s seemingly endless expanse and is constructed using a fusion of modern timber engineering and traditional Japanese nuki joinery. It seems almost primordial and elemental — much like the Pakistan Pavilion at this year’s Expo.
Situated in a large warehouse-like space that is shared with several other countries — including Palestine — the Pakistan Pavilion this year is more modest in size than its previous counterpart in Dubai.
 
 

But its ambitions are just as lofty, if not more. In fact, it is less an ‘exhibition’ and more a meditation, serving as a journey into the timeless depths of a single, humble element — rock salt.
This is where Bilgrami’s first instruction proves to be unachievable for me. The Pakistan Pavilion is the only one in its enclosure that has a continuous line of people waiting to get in, be it morning, noon or night. So what are they all so eager to see?
Before even entering, the first thing one notices is the iridiscent façade — a litany of hand-hammered copper tiles, crafted by artisans from Peshawar, with the surface of each tile rippling under the light. The floor tiles in the interior are made of pink rock salt, mined from the Salt Range in Kallar Kahar.
The pavilion’s theme, ‘The Universe in a Grain of Salt’, distils the Expo 2025 Osaka’s central vision — ‘Designing Future Society for Our Lives’ — into a tangible metaphor that serves as a symbol of resilience, healing and universal human connection.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Paradoxically, the pavilion’s power lies in its restraint. By focusing on a single material, it achieves a clarity that is surprisingly missing from some of the bigger and ‘flashier’ offerings at Expo 2025 Osaka.
Emblazoned on a wall at the pavilion’s entrance is a poem by Zehra Nigah — with an accompanying English and Japanese translation — evoking salt as both sustenance and symbol. In the background, Faiza Kassim’s melodic rendition of Nigah’s verses, accompanied by the sound of a flute, helps create what Bilgrami calls “a sanctuary for reflection.”
What follows is a chronological journey through millions of years painted by miniature artist Farooq Mustafa Maeda. It takes viewers from the transformation of ancient seas into rugged hills, to the value Mughal courts placed on salt, and miners today working in the Khewra Salt Mine. Similarly, Nisar Malik’s film at the pavilion also explores the majesty and magic of the Salt Range.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The pièce de résistance, its ‘Healing Garden’, is visually striking and deeply alluring, which explains why it is a popular picture spot for most visitors. Here, 29 columns comprising of pink, white and red rock salt slabs in their original raw states rise like glowing sentinels on slender steel rods — raw geology framed by expert human craftsmanship.
These works are meant to be touched, felt, smelt and engaged with — not just viewed in passing. With many pavilions competing for attention through LED walls, kinetic architecture and an unclear thematic throughline, Pakistan’s is refreshingly human. It trusts the strength of material, the depth of heritage, and our desire to be around creations that are luminous rather than loud.
Fittingly, this is a philosophy embraced by the Japanese. How they conduct their daily lives, coupled with the Pakistan Pavilion’s central motif, is a reminder that even the most seemingly ordinary thing or action can hold infinite meaning — if we take the time to notice.

Addressing the main event held to mark Independence Day, which, for some undisclosed reason, was organised on the eve of Aug 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif invited “all” political parties to become part of the Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan, or the compact for Pakistan’s stability.
 
 

The latest in a series of ‘compacts’ sought by the political class, this agreement, according to the prime minister, would let the world know that “[political] differences have their own place but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”. The prime minister wished for the country to move on from political divisions, leave aside personal interests and reject empty slogans to “adopt collective thinking for Pakistan”. These were noble thoughts, befitting an auspicious occasion.
If only the prime minister had not followed up with a thinly veiled diatribe against “fitnas” who “riot and vandalise” to “defame and curse and rebel against the state”. It seemed that the prime minister made an attempt to muster up magnanimity, but failed.
Two days earlier, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq set a much better example. In an attempt to mollify the opposition, which had been prepared to boycott another sitting of the National Assembly, the Speaker offered to facilitate talks between the government and the opposition.
To demonstrate good faith, he even nominated Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar to the government team that would engage with the opposition. Stressing that dialogue was the only way to resolve political differences and bridge the divide between the two camps, he urged the opposition to continue engaging with the government on issues that mattered. To his credit, the law minister, too, echoed the Speaker’s words.
 
 

Meanwhile, the PTI had a rethink about its plans to turn Aug 14 into another day of protest. The party chairman, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, announced on Tuesday that the PTI would eschew its planned agitation in favour of celebrating the day of independence.
Though the announcement got lost somewhere in the noise, it marked a significant shift in the party’s narrative. The question naturally arises: why did the PTI forego a good occasion to make some fuss and decide to de-escalate instead?
There have been some rumblings about the impatience of influential quarters to see a political compromise being worked out. One can only hope the political class has realised it has been skating on thin ice. Civilians are, after all, civilians — quickly swept aside once they have served their purpose. It would be prudent, in such circumstances, for them to band together. Perhaps they should make a greater effort to come to a mutual understanding.

ACTIVISTS protest during the final day of negotiations on a global treaty on plastic pollution, at the United Nations offices in Geneva.—AFP

KARACHI: The 10-day negotiations towards a legally binding agreement to tackle global plastic pollution fell apart on Friday, a couple of days after the first draft of the treaty was rejected by 80 countries.
The new iteration, which was to be shared on Thursday, was adjourned in 43 seconds. It took another 16 hours for the plenary to be reconvened.
Talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso said the session had merely been adjourned rather than ended.
He told AFP that countries and the secretariat “will be working to try to find a date and also a place” for resuming the talks.
However, the process was a shambles, with many delegates being excluded from the final plenary.

Talks break down after most countries reject initial draft; Musadik Malik says text offers no clarity on financing or access to tech

“We remained outside the convention centre well after past midnight on Thursday, expecting the final plenary to take place, only to be told it would reconvene the following morning, without any indication of time.
Then suddenly, they rushed it through at 6am on Friday“ Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik told Dawn from Geneva.
He called the uncertainty deliberate; “it was designed so no one had time to read the revised text, reflect on it and analyse it properly.”
As negotiators took the floor, the room echoed with familiar rhetoric and recycled talking points.
 






Despite expressions of disappointment over unmet ambitions and underwhelming outcomes, there was broad consensus on one thing: plastic pollution remains a grave and escalating threat to both people and the planet.
The High Ambition Coalition, which includes the European Union, Britain and Canada, and many African and Latin American countries, wanted to see language on reducing plastic production and the phasing out of toxic chemicals used in plastics.
The cluster of mostly oil-producing states calling themselves the Like-Minded Group — including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia — want a much narrower remit.
Hopeful
Still, many remained hopeful. Vietnam was heard saying: “It’s (the treaty) within our grasp”, while Sri Lanka found the new text “an improvement” from the one shared a day earlier.
Madagascar said countries needed to act “boldly and with strong political will” as did Tunisia calling for a more “courageous decision” from the countries.
But there were some who were brave enough to openly reject the second iteration too.
“We’ve been ignored in the treaty,” said the delegate from Paraguay, speaking on behalf of the land-locked developing countries (LLDCs).
She asserted that measuring them with the same yardstick as the plastic polluters was a “tremendous injustice” as they polluted the oceans the least, and announced her bloc was “rejecting” the second iteration of the treaty.
 


Pakistan criticised the process, finding it lacking transparency.
“There was a general sense among developing nations, including us, that they were sidelined. There was no clarity on financing nor on whether polluters would grant us access to technology. To me, even the language implied ‘you’re on your own’,” Dr Malik said of the earlier version that was shared by the organisers on Wednesday and quickly taken back.
“We were willing to meet them halfway, even take a few steps back to find common ground,” he said.
Break Free From Plastic, a global coalition of over 13,000 groups and individuals, said the talks had been “captured by the petrochemical industry.”
Despite the concerns raised by various developing nations, calling for stricter controls on plastic waste, progress remained elusive.
Subsequently, Friday’s meeting also ended without a clear agreement on the path forward.
For Dharmesh Shah — consulting senior campaigner on the Plastics Treaty at the Centre for International Environmental Law — it felt like “Busan all over again” having witnessed all the five previous rounds of negotiations.
“Better to continue talking than to go home with a bad agreement in hand,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.

• Palestinian leaders oppose Tel Aviv ‘plan’ to relocate people from Gaza to South Sudan
• At least 23 dead in fresh Israeli strikes; number of aid-seekers killed since May at 1,760
ISLAMABAD / JERU­SALEM: Pakis­tan condemned Israeli statements that suggest the creation of a so-called ‘Greater Israel’ and a plan for the forced displacement of Pales­tinians, as the UN human rights office described new Israeli settlement expansion scheme as “a war crime”.
Foreign Office spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan, in a strongly worded statement on Friday, said that such rhetoric was a “blatant violation of international law, the UN Charter, and relevant United Nations resolution”.
The reaction came a day after Israeli far-right Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that work would start on a long-delayed settlement that would  divide the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, a move his  office said would  “bury” the idea of a Palestinian state.
Israel has long had ambitions to build on  the sensitive parcel of land east of Jerusalem known as E1, but the  plan has been frozen for decades amid international opposition.
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are  considered illegal under international law, while critics and the  international community have warned construction on the roughly 12  square kilometres would undermine hopes for a contiguous future  Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.
In his statement, the FO spokesperson urged the international community to “outrightly reject these provocative” notions, warning that the actions were aimed at entrenching Israel’s illegal occupation and undermining peace efforts.
“These statements demonstrate the occupying power’s complete contempt for international efforts and reveal its intention to escalate instability in the region,” Mr Khan said.
He reiterated Pakistan’s support for a viable Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
 






‘War crime’
Separately on Friday, the UN human rights office said the Israeli plan to build thousands of new homes in the West Bank was illegal under international law and would put nearby Palestinians at risk of forced eviction, which it described as a ‘war crime’.
 
 

A UN rights office spokesperson said the plan would break the West Bank into isolated enclaves and that it is “a war crime for an occupying power to transfer its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.
Most world powers say settlement expansion erodes the viability of a two-state solution. The plan envisages a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel cites historical and biblical ties to the area and says the settlements provide security, viewing the West Bank as “disputed” rather than “occu­pied”. About 700­,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Pale­stinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Sudan settlement
Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Friday that South Sudan and Israel were discussing a deal to resettle Palestinians from war-torn Gaza in the troubled African nation, a plan that was quickly dismissed as unacceptable by Palestinian leaders.
Although no agreement had been reached, but talks between South Sudan and Israel were ongoing.
The plan, if carried further, would envisage people moving from an  enclave shattered by almost two years of war with Israel to a nation in the heart of Africa riven by years of political and ethnically-driven violence.
But the account appeared to contradict South Sudan’s foreign ministry which on Wednesday dismissed earlier reports on the plan as  “baseless”.
Arab and world leaders have rejected the idea of moving Gaza’s  population to any country. Palestinians say that would be like another   “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.
Gaza death toll rises
The UN human rights office said on Friday that at least 1,760 Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid since late May.
That marks a jump of several hundred from the 1,373 deaths it reported at the beginning of August.
“Since May 27, and as of August 13, we have recorded that at least 1,760 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,” the agency’s office for the Palestinian territories said. It stated that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.
Also on Friday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 23 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 12 who were waiting for humanitarian aid. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.

Raja Farrukh Qudoos, tehsildar of Patikka, was among the officials supervising the rescue and recovery operation in Nariyah Behak, part of Sarli Sacha village northwest of Muzaffarabad, where a cloudburst-induced flood in Jhugiyan Nullah had smashed around four houses on Thursday.
While occupants of other nearby houses had moved to lower areas a few days earlier, one house was still inhabited by a six-member family along with a guest.
According to Mr Qudoos, the guest managed to escape with fractures, but the family, comprising Muhammad Naveed, his wife, and their four children, was buried alive.

Hundreds of tourists stranded in Neelum Valley after Ratti Galli access severed

The rescue operation, suspended on Thursday evening due to heavy rain, resumed at dawn. Five bodies were recovered around 3:30am, Mr Qudoos said, while the body of the eldest daughter was found about 150 feet from the initial site at around 8:30am.

Giving an overview of the damage in Muzaffarabad, Saeed Qureshi, director operations at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), said a total of nine people had lost their lives across AJK — six in Muzaffarabad and one each in Jhelum Valley, Sudhnoti and Bagh districts. Four others were injured.
He added that 31 houses and 23 shops had been destroyed, while 23 more houses suffered partial damage. Infrastructure losses included two schools, 12 water mills, one main bridge and four pedestrian bridges, one mosque, four motorcycles, one car, a service station, five cattle sheds, and six electricity poles.
In Neelum Valley, more than 700 tourists — mostly women and children — and over 90 vehicles were stranded at the base camp of Ratti Galli lake on Thursday after rains and flooding damaged around one and a half kilometre portion of the already treacherous road.
 






AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed, who was present at the base camp, stayed overnight to reassure the tourists, announcing they would not be charged for meals or accommodation until their safe evacuation.
According to Akhtar Ayoub, district disaster management officer in Neelum Valley, the rescue operation began at 7am on Friday, and by afternoon, almost all stranded tourists were safely evacuated from the Ratti Galli base camp to Dawarian along the main Neelum Valley road.
The operation was jointly carried out by Rescue 1122, tourist police, traffic police, regular police, Pakistan Army personnel, and officials from the highways department, he said.
Video clips shared on social media showed rescue workers carrying children in their arms and guiding adults by hand across the raging torrent over hastily installed wooden planks.
“We are grateful to the people and government of Azad Kashmir. I am truly at a loss for words to express my gratitude for the way they have helped us,” one tourist said in one of the clips.
Mr Qureshi said that except for the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra Road, all other main roads across AJK were open for all types of traffic.

• Internet service across Balochistan to stay suspended until 31st, lawmakers told
• PML-N legislator accuses govt of ‘copying’ his bill
ISLAMABAD: Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar has assured the Senate that the release of an official advertisement on Independence Day, without a portrait of the country’s founder Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would be investigated.
“It is not in our notice. If it has happened, this is heart-afflicting for all,” he told the upper house of parliament on Friday. He assured that an inquiry would be conducted to ascertain how it happened and the house will be formally informed about the progress.
The government had come under fire from political and social circles over the official advertisement issued by the Ministry of Information, which omitted images of the Quaid-i-Azam and national poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal.
The advertisement, published in major national newspapers and aired on television channels, featured images of President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, as well as the chiefs of navy and air force, besides tanks and aircraft, and a picture depicting the cultural diversity of the country.
 






The issue was raised by PTI’s Faisal Javed in his maiden speech, following his reelection, soon after the house unanimously adopted a resolution reaffirming the resolve to protect the sovereignty of Pakistan, preserving its democratic ethics and building a prosperous future for generations to come.
He stressed that the ruling elite had not paid for these advertisements out of their own pockets, saying public funds had been used for personal promotion. “They even put their photographs on newly built public toilets,” he remarked.
The PTI lawmaker also accused the government of doling out civil awards on political grounds and demeaning the prestige of the awards. “This is the insult of the people who truly deserved receiving these,” he remarked.
The law minister, himself a recipient of the Nishan-i-Imtiaz, defended giving civil awards to politicians — all from the ruling coalition. He said that out of roughly 200 recipients, only about 15 were politicians.
He said these included eight members of the team led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that visited various countries after heightened tensions with India, while the rest were part of the ‘war cabinet’ formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the conflict with India, spending many sleepless nights to remain available for emergency decisions at all times.
 


Resolution on Independence Day
Through a resolution marking the Independence Day, the house pledged to strive for sustainable development, economic empowerment and national unity.
Honouring the leadership of the Quaid-i-Azam, the resolution, moved by the law minister, paid homage to all those whose sacrifices made Pakistan a sovereign and independent state. The resolution commended the armed forces and security institutions for their unmatched valour and sacrifices in defending the nation. It paid tribute to the martyrs and Ghazis, pledging to preserve and uphold their legacy for future generations.
The resolution paid special tribute to the parliamentarians, who framed the Constitution of Pakistan and advanced democratic reforms, while reaffirming the commitment to preserving the parliamentary democracy, constitutional supremacy and rule of law.
 






The resolution also expressed commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence, regional stability and constructive engagement with neighbouring countries. It also expressed commitment to address the shared challenges, including climate change, economic inequalities, terrorism and public health crisis, while safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty.
The resolution called upon the citizens, particularly the youth, to work beyond personal and political differences and contribute actively to nation building through education, innovation, civic engagement and service to humanity.
Another resolution, urging the federal and provincial governments to celebrate the 1,500th Eid Miladun Nabi (peace be upon him) on a grand scale, was also adopted unanimously.
 






Internet services
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry informed the house that internet services in Balochistan would remain suspended until the end of August.
Responding to a calling-attention notice about the suspension of mobile internet across 36 districts of the province in the name of security causing great unrest among students, freelancers and businessmen, he said the suspension was temporary and solely a security measure.
 
 

As per a policy directive under Section 8 of the Pakistan Telec­ommunication (Reor­ganisation) Act, 1996, he said such decisions followed a specific process. He explained that requests originated from the Ministry of Interior, based on recommendations from relevant security stakeholders, and were then forwarded to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for implementation.
The minister said that mobile internet services in Balochistan were suspended from August 6 to 31 due to credible security concerns. However, he added, telephone services remained fully operational, and the restriction was limited to mobile internet.
“All airlines, including PIA and private carriers, are fully functional in Balochistan, while road and rail links to Quetta and other cities remain open,” he added.
‘Plagiarism’ accusation
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was criticism the government had to face from one of its own.
As the Virtual Assets Ordinance was laid before the house, PML-N MNA Afnan Ullah Khan said the bill had been blocked when he tried to bring it to the house after months of hard work.  “Now they have copied and brought it to the house,” the PML-N lawmaker said and noted that this comes in the ambit of plagiarism and cheating. “The credit should be given to the one whose bill this is,” he said.
Later, another government ally protested an attempt to get the petroleum amendment bill — okayed by the National Assembly — passed without sending it to the standing committee concerned.  It was BAP parliamentary leader Manzoor Kakar loudly opposed the bill.
The law minister initially pointed out that it was a prerogative of the house to pass a bill without referring it to the standing committee, as it had been discussed threadbare in the lower house, but PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the move.
The law minister ultimately had to surrender and agreed that the bill be referred to the standing committee. He, however, said he was doing this out of respect for Mr Kakar and still believed it was not a legal requirement to send a bill already passed by the NA to a standing committee.

• Two excise officials targeted near Dera-Daraban bypass
PESHAWAR: Five people, including two personnel from the paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and two Excise Department officials, were martyred, while three militants were killed in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, official sources said.
Counter-Terrorism Department officials said their team ambushed a group of militants affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in an intelligence-based operation carried out in Regi Lalma, on the outskirts of the provincial capital, on Thursday night.
They said the CTD had been tracking the group, which was involved in 18 different attacks on police and citizens. These attacks took place along Peshawar’s northern border with Mohmand district, southern border with Kohat district, eastern border with Khyber district and western border with Nowshera district.
The ambush was based on technical surveillance, the officials said, adding that the militants’ identities were verified.
 
 

The officials said the group was planning an attack on the border between Peshawar and Khyber districts, adding that the militants opened indiscriminate fire when intercepted by a SWAT team. In the battle, CTD gunned down three militants while four others fled.
The officials said one of the killed militants was identified as Abdullah, alias Jawad, an Afghan national, confirmed through his Afghan citizenship card recovered from him. He was a wanted militant, while the identities of the other two are being determined.
The officials said technical investigations linked the group to at least 18 militant attacks in Peshawar. “Preliminary intelligence confirms the militants were part of a banned TTP-linked cell operating under foreign-based, foreign-funded handlers, with active plans to escalate attacks on security forces, public infrastructure, and pro-state individuals,” the officials said.
FC men martyred
In Lakki Marwat, two FC personnel and a civilian were martyred when three armed men targeted an FC official and his brother while they were returning home from a hotel on the Indus Highway in the Wanda Karim Khan area.
The FC official’s brother, Ihsanullah, initially survived but later succumbed to his injuries. He told police that his brother had returned to the village on leave a week ago and that they were walking home when armed men suddenly attacked them with assault rifles.
 
 

“We were injured and fell to the ground while the assailants fled,” he said, adding that his brother died upon reaching the hospital.
Police said another FC official also died in the attack, and his body was taken by relatives from the crime scene.
Police registered a case under relevant sections of law at Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station in Darra Pezu and launched an investigation.
Excise team targeted
In another militant attack in Dera Ismail Khan, two Excise Department officials were slain, and a hotel owner injured, when unidentified assailants opened fire near Hashim Hotel on the Dera-Daraban bypass on Friday.
According to police, excise and taxation officer Faridullah Khan reported that ASI Syed Ali Shah of the Excise Police Station South Region, along with volunteer Abideen, son of Amir Muhammad Banuchi from Bannu, had left for duty in an official vehicle.
While stopping at Hashim Hotel for breakfast and waiting for other staff, two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire. The ASI and volunteer died on the spot. The hotel owner, Hashim, 47, of Bhakkar, sustained injuries.
Police termed the incident an act of terror and said it was part of a recent wave of targeted assaults on law enforcement personnel. The area was cordoned off, and a search operation was launched to trace the assailants.

Hirschman (The Strategy of Economic Development, 1958).
ON Pakistan’s 78th independence anniversary, we have to ask ourselves a sobering question — why is the country that was born on the wings of hope, between promise and peril, and seemingly prospered for decades, in its current dismal state? Why are its human, social and economic development indicators competing with Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa? Why have numerous promised ‘game changers’ over the decades, from CENTO and SEATO membership to CPEC and SIFC, failed to deliver for the people? 
The answer is simple as much as it is uncomfortable. Pakistan is not organised as a polity for development, let alone inclusive development. It is organised for elite extraction, appropriation, expropriation and enrichment. And the two models are not just incompatible, they are mutually exclusive. 
A society is organised for development when its laws, institutions, cultural norms and incentives are deliberately structured to expand opportunity, raise productivity and channel resources towards the most optimal use for the widest common good. Economies that have successfully climbed the ladder of development, at least over the past five decades, display common characteristics. These include an emphasis on human capital development, high savings and investment rates, an equitable and non-discriminatory tax regime, responsible governance, high levels of transparency and accountability, institutional checks and balances against executive overreach as well as policy and regulatory capture. 

Pakistan’s current organising principle as a polity is incompatible with development.

This is in sharp contrast to how Pakistan has been configured as a polity. To adapt Lant Pritchett et al’s quote, countries such as Pakistan “look like a state” but do not exhibit the foundational characteristics.  
Pakistan has a Constitution but one that fails to restrain, to provide checks and balances; it has ‘law of the land’ without rule of law; governments without governance; buildings without institutions; projects without purpose; spending without impact; civil service without service; security agencies without security. Like many other Third World countries, Pakistan has been organised as a neocolonial project with local elites installed on behalf of former colonial powers. Two natural corollaries of elite capture are weakened institutional checks and balances, and extraction. 
The wages of extraction are evident in how the two broad groups of society — the elites versus the non-elites — have done over the course of Pakistan’s existence. The current state of these two broad segments are in stark contrast. The lived experience of ordinary Pakistanis is one of grinding poverty, unemployment, unpayable bills and taxes, state repression and waiting in endless queues to leave the country. 
On the other hand, the general elite as a broad cohort has never had it better. With over $17 billion of privileges accumulating to the elites each year via tax exemptions, concessions, land grants, budgetary allocations, etc, and an estimated siphoning off of around 30-40 per cent from public procurement and development budgets, an estimated annual capital flight of well over $10bn takes place. This has allowed ruling elites to accumulate vast offshore assets, as revealed in the various investigative leaks such as the Panama and Pandora Papers. 
Neither of the two realities and daily lived experiences is an ‘accident’. It is by design and a result of deliberate policy choices. The process of marginalisation, income and wealth redistribution and extraction via public policy has accelerated from 2008 onwards. Powerful social, economic and political groups such as political families, the military, landed and business elites and bureaucrats have begun to monopolise public resources, and shape policy to favour themselves, away from ordinary citizens at large.
This widening divergence between ordinary, disconnected Pakistanis and the wealth accumulation of the connected elite coincides with the use of public policy as a tool for extraction and redistribution from the bottom to the top. Two areas where public policy has made possible the largest transfer of resources in Pakistan’s history, and mortally damaged the economy, are IPPs and sugar. (Land allocation is a third area). 
The scale of the wealth transfer is staggering. As a crude indication, around 33 IPPs received contractual capacity payments of Rs8.3 trillion between 2014 and 2024, according to disclosure by the Power Division. According to the 2020 GoP inquiry report, the return on equity of a majority of the IPPs set up under the various power policies ranged from 40pc to 87pc in rupee terms. Against an initial investment of Rs110bn, IPPs set up under the 1994 and 2002 power policies alone earned net profits of Rs618bn. Investment payback periods of projects reviewed by the committee ranged from one to six years.
In the case of sugar, manipulation of data as well as government policy has regularly handed 90 millers, across the political spectrum, hundreds of billions of rupees in unearned rents. The rentier economy around sugar has destroyed Pakistan’s cotton economy, the mainstay of the country’s exports. And yet it continues unchecked.
Vested interests have begun employing the same template in wheat to earn enormous rents at the expense of the country’s 11.7 million farmers. More is in the pipeline, from rare earths and minerals extraction in KP, canals in Cholistan, and a crypto misadventure. Fire sales of state assets such as ports, airports and other vital infrastructure are also on the cards. This is institutionalised extraction. Institutions, budgets, laws, policies, markets and regulations have been increasingly structured around securing perpetual rents and privileges for the elites. 
In short, Pakistan is not organised for development. A self-interested ruling elite lacking ‘skin in the game’ with little or no incentives to develop the country has rigged the system for extraction. In its current configuration, Pakistan is set up as a system of spoils for this elite. Without a fundamental rethink and reformation of the state, no amount of copper and gold or rare earth mineral finds will secure Pakistan’s future.

The minister stated this during a meeting with Engro Fertilisers Chief Executive Officer Ali Rathore on Friday.
The discussion centred on guaranteeing consistent fertiliser supply nationwide, stabilising prices for farmers, and introducing forward-looking measures to strengthen the agriculture sector’s resilience.
Mr Hussain stressed that timely and affordable access to fertiliser is not merely a commercial matter but a critical pillar of Pakistan’s food security and economic stability.
He reaffirmed the government’s determination to protect farmers from market manipulation by eliminating hoarding, curbing black marketing, and enforcing strict adherence to national quality standards.
He emphasised that any disruption in the supply of fertiliser directly impacts crop yields and can jeopardise the livelihoods of millions of farming households.
The minister urged Engro Fertilisers to expand its distribution network, particularly in remote rural areas, and to align supply schedules with the agricultural calendar to avoid shortages during peak sowing periods. 
He also highlighted the importance of innovation in delivery systems, including farmer facilitation centres and mobile supply networks, so that small-scale farmers have equal access to quality inputs.

Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
A notification from the Finance Division, available with Dawn.com, stated that the new price of HSD was Rs272.99, while petrol would remain at Rs264.61. Additionally, the prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs7.19 per litre and Rs8.2, respectively.
“The Government has decided to revise the petroleum product prices for the fortnight commencing August 16, 2025, in line with the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the concerned ministries,” the notification read.
Earlier this week, the per-litre HSD price was expected to fall by about Rs11.50, while petrol was expected to see an increase of Rs1.40 per litre for the next fortnight, driven by shifts in the global market and exchange rate movements.
International petrol prices inched up by 15 cents per barrel over the past fortnight, while diesel rates fell by about $4.5 per barrel. The rupee also appreciated slightly against the dollar.
On July 31, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a cut in the prices of petrol by Rs6.17 per litre and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs10.86, respectively, for the next fortnight. The cuts in petrol and HSD prices were higher than previously estimated.

Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Key points:

210 killed in KP, including 91 in Buner
12 dead in GB, nine dead in AJK
Over 10 people killed each in Bajaur, Battagram, Shangla and Mansehra
KP government rescue helicopter crashes, five crew dead

The province-wide deaths in KP included 184 men, 14 women and 12 children, with Buner witnessing the highest number of deaths, 91, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
The data added that 68 homes, three schools and 16 other structures were destroyed amid the deluge, with 49 homes being destroyed in Swat alone.
According to the PDMA report, 61 houses were partially destroyed and seven were completely destroyed.
The report added that heavy rain in the area is likely to continue intermittently until August 21.
“On the special instructions of the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, relief funds have been released for the districts affected by rains and flash floods,” the report read.
“A total of Rs500 million has been released for the districts most affected by floods,” it added, stating that Rs150m has been released for Buner district, Rs100m each for Bajaur, Battagram and Mansehra districts and Rs50m for Swat.
 






The PDMA added that it ordered the relevant institutions and bodies to intensify rescue efforts and dispatched letters to district administrations to take precautions ahead of the upcoming weather.
In the evening, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a video statement where he said that all departments and institutions are engaged in rescue operations, which are being monitored from a control room set up at CM House in Peshawar.
“The province, especially in the Malakand and Hazara regions, has been hit by terrible floods due to cloudbursts and rain,” he said. “As a result, many lives have been lost due to various accidents.
“Two helicopters of the provincial government were working to rescue people, but one of these helicopters met with a tragic accident due to bad weather. Five crew members were martyred.”
The CM outlined that the district administrations and all provincial government departments are actively engaged and “ensuring all measures to protect the lives and property of the people”.
“The administration of the affected districts, as well as others, has also been put on high alert and safety measures are being taken,” he added. “Heavy machinery has been deployed in the affected areas for rescue operations and to clear blocked roads.”
The CM added that provincial lawmakers are in the affected areas and coordinating with local officials.
“In this hour of difficulty, the provincial government stands with its people,” Gandapur said. “The provincial government will fully repair the damage caused by these natural disasters and the public is urged to cooperate with the administration.”

Meanwhile, the KP Health Department issued a pair of notifications — available with Dawn.com — declaring a health emergency in the districts of Buner, Swat, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Bajaur and Mohmand and the establishment of flood control rooms and disease data-sharing centres in hospitals across KP.
The notification declaring a health emergency in all hospitals in the aforementioned districts stated that the step had been taken “to prevent [the] outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population”.
It added that all healthcare staff were to be put on high alert and cancel their leaves to ensure adequate staffing for the provision of healthcare to victims.
The second notification, addressed to all hospitals in KP, ordered the establishment of flood control rooms in order to ensure the availability of medicines and the functioning of medical equipment.
“In light of the anticipated rise in fatalities and injuries, as well as the increasing cases of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, you are requested to nominate a focal person from your district who will be responsible for providing daily updates to the health directorate,” the notification read.
Earlier, the KP government dispatched a helicopter with supplies to Bajaur district, but said that it lost contact with the aircraft. It later confirmed in a statement that the helicopter had crashed and two pilots and three crew were killed.
 






“As a result of this tragic accident, five passengers, including two pilots, were martyred,” the statement read, quoting Gandapur.
“The provincial government has called for a day of mourning tomorrow and flags will be flown at half mast,” the statement added. “Rescue teams have been dispatched to the crash site and the martyrs will be buried with full honours.”
In an earlier statement, the CM was quoted as saying that contact with the helicopter had been lost due to “bad weather”.
 


Buner Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan told Dawn.com that 78 people had lost their lives, while “several” were missing. A PDMA daily situation report seen by Dawn.com confirmed the casualties, with 75 men, two women and a child among the deceased.
He added that an emergency has been declared across the district as relief efforts continue in flood-affected areas.
“Helicopters are being used to carry out rescue operations in remote and inaccessible regions,” he said, adding that in Pir Baba Bazaar and the adjoining neighbourhood, floodwaters have completely submerged the area.
“A mosque in Gokand was destroyed and a large number of livestock perished,” he added. “Several roads remain blocked, and the exact number of missing persons has yet to be confirmed.”

Officials said the true figure would only be known once floodwaters receded.
Other most-impacted districts included Bajaur — located in the same Malakand Division as Buner — where eight children were among 21 killed and eight were injured due to flash floods, the PDMA report said.
Incidents related to lightning strikes took the lives of 15 men in Battagram, while 14 deaths and two injuries were reported in Mansehra due to floods.
In Swat, flash floods and thunder strikes claimed 11 lives, the PDMA report added. A roof collapse left five men dead and three wounded in Lower Dir, while two men were killed and as many were injured in a similar incident in Shangla.
The KP government said a provincial govt MI-17 rescue helicopter had reached Buner to evacuate people to safe areas.
 






Meanwhile, Muhammad Sohail, a media coordinator for Rescue 1122, told Dawn.com that more than 157 bodies have so far been recovered, while over 100 people, including women and children, have been rescued and moved to safe locations.
“The situation is at its worst and rescue operations are continuing in the affected areas, as authorities work to reach stranded residents and provide relief,” he said.
Speaking to Geo News, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi responded in the affirmative when asked whether an emergency should be declared. An official notification for that is yet to be issued.
PTI MNA Gohar Ali Khan, who is from Malakand Division’s Buner district, told Geo News: “We have sent rescue teams but reaching the points is also difficult.”
 






Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed condolences over the loss of life and the flooding, as well as the helicopter crash, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The Sindh CM spoke with Kundi and KP CM Gandapur, conveying the Sindh government’s solidarity and offering any assistance.
“Medical treatment facilities have been made available in Karachi for those injured in the floods, underscoring Sindh’s dedication to aiding affected communities,” he said.
Buner District Police Officer (DPO) also told Dawn.com in an earlier statement that 54 bodies were brought to a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the relevant authorities to accelerate the rescue operation in Battagram district. In a statement, he expressed grief over the deaths and prayed for those who lost their lives in the flash flood.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur spoke to the Hazara commissioner and Battagram DC on the phone and directed that the district administration officials reach the site to supervise the rescue operations, his government said.
 






12 dead and two missing: officials
In flooding across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) during the past 24 hours, 12 people were killed, two others were missing and 15 people were injured, according to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA).
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood in Ghizer district’s Daen village destroyed 20 homes and killed two people, adding that glacier lake outburst floods continued from Shishper Glacier, causing erosion in areas downstream of Hassanabad in Hunza.
The flood displaced more families as four more homes were submerged and farmland was destroyed.
GBDMA Assistant Director Hunza and Nagar Zubair Ahmed Khan told Dawn.com that the residents of six homes were already moved to safe places.
“Glacier lake outburst floods in Hassanabad nullah continued erosion,” Khan said.
“Work has started on the rehabilitation of affected roads, power houses, bridges and water supply works in all districts of the province,” GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq told Dawn.com.
“The chief minister has instructed all ministers to visit the affected areas and supervise the rehabilitation works.”
The spokesperson added that a missing person, who was swept away by flooding in Diamer, has yet to be found.
“Thousands of people have been deprived of drinking water and electricity due to the flood,” Firaq added.
“Power has been cut off in Gilgit city and its suburbs since last night. According to the Power Department, power has been cut off for the city due to the rupture of the water channel at the Naltar Power House.”
Firaq said that small-scale flooding was expected today in Khanbari, Thor, Tangir, Khanar and Batoghah, but added that there was “no major damage”.

“The Karakoram Highway is closed due to the flood in Kohistan Achar Nallah yesterday, which has cut off land communication between Gilgit-Baltistan and Rawalpindi,” he said. “Due to this situation, a large number of passengers and tourists are stranded on both sides.”
In Skardu, police spokesperson Ghulam Mehmood said that the RC bridge at Skardu Baghicha was swept away by the flood, severing the Baltistan Highway.
“This closure suspended traffic between Gilgit and Skardu, while a foreign tourist vehicle was caught in a landslide at the same location,” he told Dawn.com. “A guide from Punjab died after a stone hit the vehicle. The tourists and the body have been moved to Skardu.”
Mehmood added that the water channel near Sadpara Dam was severely damaged by the flood, while power to Skardu city was cut off due to floodwater entering the power station. He added that water flow has since been restored.
“The road from Sadpara to Deosai has been closed at three or four places due to flooding,” he added.
Munir A Johar, an official in the GB information department, said in a statement that Rs93.3m had been released by the administration to deputy commissioners so they could pay the families of those affected to ensure their rehabilitation.
AJK sees nine dead, four injured amid flash floods
Meanwhile, in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), rescuers and volunteers recovered six bodies from a suburban area of Muzaffarabad today, as the death toll from rain-related incidents rose to nine following Thursday’s flash floods triggered by torrential rains, officials said.
Raja Farrukh Qudoos, a local official in Patikka, was among the officials supervising the rescue and recovery operation in Nariyah Behak, part of Sarli Sacha village northwest of Muzaffarabad, where a cloudburst-induced flood in Jhugiyan Nullah had smashed around four houses.
“While occupants of other nearby houses had moved to lower areas a few days earlier, one house was still inhabited by a six-member family along with a guest,” Qudoos said. “The guest managed to escape but was injured, while the family was buried alive.”
The rescue operation, suspended on Thursday evening due to heavy rain, resumed at dawn.
“Five bodies were recovered around 3:30am,” Qudoos said, adding that the body of the eldest daughter was found about 150 feet from the initial site at around 8:30am.
Giving an overview of the damage in Muzaffarabad, Saeed Qureshi, director operations at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), said that a total of nine people had lost their lives across AJK — six in Muzaffarabad and one each in the Jhelum Valley, Sudhnoti and Bagh districts. Four others were injured.
“Thirty-one houses and 23 shops had been destroyed, while 23 more houses suffered partial damage,” Qureshi said. “Infrastructure losses included two schools, 12 water mills, one main bridge, four pedestrian bridges, one mosque, four motorcycles, one car, a service station, five cattle sheds, and six electricity poles.”

In Neelum Valley, more than 700 tourists — mostly women and children — and over 90 vehicles were stranded at the Ratti Galli lake base camp on Thursday after rains and flooding damaged over one kilometre of the already treacherous road.
AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed, who was present at the base camp, stayed overnight to reassure the tourists, announcing they would not be charged for meals or accommodation until their safe evacuation.
Akhtar Ayoub, the district disaster management officer in Neelum Valley, said the rescue operation began at 7am today, with almost all stranded tourists evacuated from the Ratti Galli base camp to Dawarian, along the main Neelum Valley road.
“The operation was jointly carried out by Rescue 1122, tourist police, traffic police, regular police, Pakistan Army personnel and officials from the highways department,” he said.

Qureshi said that except for the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra Road, where operations to clear a landslide at Lohar Galli were in progress, all other main roads across AJK were open for all types of traffic.
Floods wreak havoc in Bajaur, Battagram, Mansehra
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Battagram Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan said the casualties occurred after five houses were destroyed last night due to a lightning strike in Neel Band village, which is located on the border of Battagram and Mansehra districts.
In Bajaur earlier today, there were “reports of several people injured in flash floods”, which were caused by a cloudburst (heavy rainfall) in Salarzai tehsil’s Jabrarai village“, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com.
“Rescue 1122 personnel, with the cooperation of residents, have so far recovered 16 bodies and rescued three injured from the rubble and rainwater,” Faizi confirmed, stating an earlier toll.
A search and rescue operation was underway under the supervision of Bajaur District Emergency Officer Amjad Khan as seven people remained missing, Faizi said, citing locals. DEO Amjad Khan and the station house in-charge were personally supervising the operation, the Rescue 1122 official added.
 


The deluge in Battagram affected villages located on the border areas of Neel Band, Sarim and Malkal Gali, according to a statement issued by Battagram Rescue 1122 spokesperson Aziz Khan.
“The ongoing rescue efforts are facing challenges due to intermittent rain and a near-total loss of mobile network coverage, severely impacting communication,” the statement explained.
In Lower Dir, five people died and four were wounded when the roof of a house in the Maidan area’s Suri Pao village collapsed due to heavy rain, Faizi said.
Detailing the hurdles, the rescue official said: “The rescue team reached the scene after walking for three hours despite heavy rain, flooded rails, difficult and bad roads.”
Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
 
 

In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.
At least 507 people, including 159 children, have died and 768 others have been injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not invited to the talks, and his European allies fear Trump might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict and recognising — if only informally — Russian control over one fifth of Ukraine.
Trump sought to assuage such concerns as he boarded Air Force One, saying he would let Ukraine decide on any possible territorial swaps. “I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine, I’m here to get them to a table,” he said.
Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters: “I want to see a ceasefire rapidly… I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today… I want the killing to stop.”
The US and Russian presidents are due to meet at a Cold War-era air force base in Alaska’s largest city at around 11am (12am PKT) for their first face-to-face talks since Trump returned to the White House.
Trump hopes a truce in the 3-1/2-year-old war will bolster his credentials as a global peacemaker worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.
For Putin, the summit is already a big win that he can portray as evidence that years of Western attempts to isolate Russia have unravelled and that Moscow is retaking its rightful place at the top table of international diplomacy.
Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev described the pre-summit mood as “combative” and said the two leaders would discuss not only Ukraine but the full spectrum of bilateral relations, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.
Trump, who once said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours, conceded on Thursday it had proven a tougher task than he had expected. He said that if Friday’s talks went well, quickly arranging a second, three-way summit with Zelensky would be even more important than his encounter with Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a three-way summit would be possible if the Alaska talks bore fruit, Interfax news agency reported. Peskov also said Friday’s talks could last 6-7 hours and that aides would take part in what had been expected to be one-to-one meetings.
Zelensky said the summit should open the way for a “just peace” and three-way talks that included him, but added that Russia was continuing to wage war on Friday. A Russian ballistic missile earlier struck Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding another.
“It’s time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
‘Smart guy’
The Kremlin said Putin would arrive in Alaska at 11am (12am PKT)  and would be met at his plane by Trump.
“He is a smart guy, been doing it for a long time, but so have I… We get along, there’s a good respect level on both sides,” Trump said of Putin. He also welcomed Putin’s decision to bring a lot of businesspeople with him to Alaska.
“But they’re not doing business until we get the war settled,” he said, repeating a threat of “economically severe” consequences for Russia if the summit goes badly.
One source acquainted with Kremlin thinking said there were signs that Moscow could be ready to strike a compromise on Ukraine, given that Putin understood Russia’s economic vulnerability and the  costs of continuing the war.
Reuters has previously reported that Putin might be willing to freeze the conflict along the front lines, provided there was a legally binding pledge not to enlarge NATO eastwards and to lift some Western sanctions. NATO has said that Ukraine’s future is in the alliance.
Russia, whose war economy is showing signs of strain, is vulnerable to further US sanctions — and Trump has threatened tariffs on buyers of Russian crude, primarily China and India.
“For Putin, economic problems are secondary to goals, but he understands our vulnerability and costs,” the Russian source said.
Putin this week held out the prospect of something else he knows Trump wants — a new nuclear arms control accord to replace the last surviving one, which is due to expire next February.
Common ground?
The source familiar with Kremlin thinking said it looked as if the two sides had been able to find some common ground.
“Apparently, some terms will be agreed upon… because Trump cannot be refused, and we are not in a position to refuse (due to sanctions pressure),” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.
Putin has said he is open to a full ceasefire but that issues of verification must first be sorted out. One compromise could be a truce in the air war.
Zelensky has ruled out formally handing Moscow any territory and is also seeking a security guarantee backed by the United States. It is unclear how that guarantee could work.
Ukrainians who spoke to Reuters in central Kyiv on Friday were not optimistic about the summit.
“Nothing good will happen there, because war is war; it will not end. The territories — we’re not going to give anything to anyone,” said Tetiana Harkavenko, a 65-year-old cleaner.</p><small>2025-08-15 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/152047179db1eb1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931082/pm-shehbaz-orders-comprehensive-flood-relief-operations-in-kp-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz orders comprehensive flood relief operations in KP, AJK</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday instructed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to conduct comprehensive relief operations in flood-affected areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Kashmir.
At least 198 people lost their lives and several remained missing as flash floods wreaked havoc across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
 






“The prime minister directed the NDMA to continue its cooperation with the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the PDMA, to provide them with all possible support in the rescue and relief operation and to utilise all resources for this,” a statement issued by the prime minister’s office read.
NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik briefed the prime minister on the damage caused by cloudbursts, flash floods in the upper parts of the country, as well as the rescue and relief operation.
The prime minister directed the NDMA chairman to further coordinate with the KP provincial government for rescue and relief activities.
“Tents, medicines, food items and other relief materials should be delivered to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government immediately,” the prime minister directed.
The premier further ordered that relief materials should be sent through trucks on a priority basis immediately.
“People and tourists stranded in the flood-affected areas should be immediately taken to safe places.”
The prime minister was briefed on the progress of the rescue and relief operation, along with the assessment of the damage, during the meeting.
PM Shehbaz also had a telephone conversation with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and expressed grief over the loss of precious lives due to the recent cloudburst and flash floods in KP. He told Gandapur that the federal government will provide all possible assistance to the provincial government.
The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
“Our sympathies are with the victims in this hour of difficulty,” the prime minister said.
Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.
At least 507 people, including 159 children, have died and 768 others have been injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to daily data from the NDMA.</p><small>2025-08-15 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15174636301af0d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931071/privatisation-commission-signs-pact-with-financial-advisers-for-privatising-zarai-taraqiati-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Privatisation Commission signs pact with financial advisers for privatising Zarai Taraqiati Bank</strong></a><br><p>The Privatisation Commission on Friday signed an agreement with financial advisers for the privatisation of Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL), a statement from the Ministry of Privatisation said.
Founded in 1961 as the ADBP, it was renamed and incorporated as ZTBL in 2002 under the Companies Ord­inance 1984. The bank of­­fers agricultural credit and banking services to farmers nationwide and remains Pakistan’s largest public-sector agri lender.
Last month, the Board of the Privatisation Com­mission had approved the ap­­pointment of financial advisers for the divestme­nt of ZTBL, marking it as one of the government’s priority transactions in the current privatisation pipeline.
“The Privatisation Commission has signed a Financial Advisory Services Agreement (Fasa) with a consortium led by Next Capital Limited for the strategic privatisation of Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL),” the statement said.
It added that the consortium also includes Ijaz Ahmed and Associates, Baker Tilly Mehmood Idrees Qamar, Executives Network International, Bridge Public Relations, Savills Pakistan Private Limited, and Prima Global Consulting Pvt Ltd.
“This initiative reflects the government’s unwavering commitment to inviting private sector investment, modernising banking operations, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs),” the statement added.
According to the statement, post-privatisation, ZTBL, with its nationwide network of 501 branches, will be better positioned to deliver faster, more accessible credit to small farmers and rural communities.
It added that the bank will be able to “introduce modern banking technologies and digital solutions for agriculture financing as well as strengthen governance, transparency, and accountability, expand financial products tailored for emerging agribusiness opportunities and enhance customer service and on-ground responsiveness to meet farmers’ evolving needs”.
The privatisation of ZTBL is designed to catalyse investment in Pakistan’s agricultural future by combining private sector efficiency with ZTBL’s long-standing expertise in agricultural finance for fostering rural prosperity and ensuring farmers have timely access to essential financial resources.
Under the agreement, the financial advisers will conduct sell-side due diligence, carry out market sounding, engage with potential investors, structure the transaction, market it to investors, and assist the Privatisation Commission in a transparent bidding process, the ministry said.
The winning consortium had achieved the highest technical and financial score among six competing bidders, which incl­uded other leading groups headed by Arif Habib Ltd, AF Fergu­son, AKD Securities Ltd, Bri­­­­­dge Factor, and JS Bank.
The board also approved the formation of a nego­tiation committee to finalise the Fasa with the selected consortium.
Last month, the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation had raised concerns over the government’s plans to privatise two state-owned entities — the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) and ZTBL — and questioned the rationale behind their inclusion in the programme.</p><small>2025-08-15 15:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1516180794af731.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931059/facing-us-tariffs-indian-pm-modi-vows-self-reliance' target='_blank'><strong>Facing US tariffs, Indian PM Modi vows self-reliance</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that his country is seeking self-reliance in energy independence and the development of its own powerful defence systems, vowing to defend his country’s interests “like a wall”.
Modi delivered his annual Independence Day address from the ramparts of New Delhi’s Red Fort at a time when India faces intense pressure and threats of additional tariffs from the United States.
“Self-reliance is the foundation of developed India,” Modi said after a flypast of military helicopters scattered flower petals above an invited crowd of thousands. “Freedom becomes meaningless if someone becomes too dependent on others.”
Ties between New Delhi and Washington have been strained by Trump’s ultimatum that India end its purchases of Russian oil, a key source of revenue for Moscow as it wages its military offensive in Ukraine.
India has said it “stands ready” to support efforts to end the Ukraine war and endorses a summit to be held between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska later today.
However, the US has announced that it will double new import tariffs on India from 25 per cent to 50pc by August 27 if New Delhi does not switch its crude suppliers.
 
 

“We know that we remain dependent on many countries to meet our energy needs”, said Modi. “But to build a truly self-reliant India, we must achieve energy independence.”
Modi did not speak directly about Trump, but said he would “stand like a wall” against any policy that hurts the interests of farmers.
Agriculture employs vast numbers of people in India and has been a key sticking point in trade negotiations.
“When economic selfishness is rising day by day… we must not just sit and worry about the crisis but instead focus on our strengths,” Modi said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a statement congratulating India’s Independence Day, said the relations between the two nations were “consequential and far-reaching”, and wanted to “ensure a brighter future for both”.
‘Blood and water’
Modi also urged scientists and engineers to focus on building key sectors and technologies, including fighter jet engines, semiconductor chips and military hardware systems.
“We will have India-made semiconductor chips in the market by the year’s end,” Modi said.
He added that the country was also working towards building a space station and would have a “defence shield” in the next decade, without giving further details.
 
 

Modi also honoured the Indian armed forces, which took part in a four-day conflict with arch-rival Pakistan that ended in a ceasefire on May 10.
“India will give a befitting reply to any other misadventure by the enemy,” he added, and referred to New Delhi’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
“India has decided that blood and water will not flow together”, he added.
The May conflict was sparked as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence — a claim strongly refuted by Pakistan.
In response to the attack, India held the IWT in abeyance, violating the agreement itself.
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, PAF downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.</p><small>2025-08-15 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1517394812c43bf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931066/man-dies-fleeing-ice-raid-in-california' target='_blank'><strong>Man dies fleeing ICE raid in California</strong></a><br><p>A man who was believed to have been running from a raid by US immigration agents died on Thursday after being hit by a car on a freeway, police said.
City managers in Monrovia, near Los Angeles, said police had been called after there were reports of activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a Home Depot.
During the raid, one man ran from the parking lot of the hardware store — a place where day labourers commonly gather looking for casual work — and onto a busy freeway during rush hour, Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik told media.
A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said the 40-year-old man was taken to a hospital, where he died from his injuries a few hours later.
Neither CHP nor the city were immediately able to provide any details on the man’s identity.
Feik said: “The city has not received any communication or information from ICE.” ICE did not immediately respond to an AFP request for information.
Masked and armed agents from ICE and US Border Patrol began carrying out raids in and around Los Angeles earlier this year, as President Donald Trump looked to fulfil his election promise to carry out the most deportations in US history.
 
 

The raids, which target hardware stores, carwashes and other businesses where undocumented people seek work, sparked fury in the multicultural city.
Protests in Los Angeles, some of which saw isloated instances of violence, were met with the mass deployment of soldiers by the federal government, even as local law enforcement said they could handle the unrest.
A federal court in July ordered a halt to ICE’s roving patrols in several California counties, after rights groups argued that the raids appeared to be arresting people largely based on their race, the language they were speaking or the place they had gathered.</p><small>2025-08-15 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15172606e75d30b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931064/rights-groups-sue-german-ministers-over-deportation-of-afghans-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Rights groups sue German ministers over deportation of Afghans from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Advocacy groups filed a criminal case against Germany’s foreign and interior ministers on Friday, accusing them of failing to protect Afghan nationals in Pakistan with German admission approvals from deportation to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
Pakistan has begun deporting documented Afghan refugees ahead of a September 1 deadline, a move the United Nations warns could force more than one million to leave.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated August 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
Among those at risk are more than 2,000 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany under programmes for people deemed vulnerable under Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
The relocations have been put on hold, pending a review by Germany’s new conservative-led government as it tries to deliver on its election promise to curb migration.
Refugee group PRO ASYL and the Patenschaftsnetzwerk Ortskraefte, a non-profit supporting former local staff who worked for Germany, filed a criminal complaint with Berlin prosecutors against Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt.
By allowing Pakistan to deport Afghans already accepted into German resettlement programmes, they said, the ministers had committed “abandonment” and “failure to render assistance” to people at risk under Section 221 of the Criminal Code.
They said more than 400 people approved for relocation to Germany had been arrested in Pakistan in recent weeks and 34 people had already been deported. Deportees face grave risks under Taliban rule, including imprisonment, mistreatment or execution, the groups said.
Victoria Lies, a lawyer who represents several of those affected, said some of her clients had been separated from their families, and in one case, a girl had been sent back to Afghanistan alone.
The foreign and interior ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.
However, Wadephul said on Friday his ministry was in “high-level contact with the Pakistani government to ensure the protection of these people and to provide rapid assistance to those who have been deported or arrested in recent days”.
The interior ministry has said it cannot provide a timeline to determine the future of the admission programme but expects decisions soon.
The two NGOs’ complaint builds on a July 8 legal opinion commissioned by them, which said German officials could be criminally liable if they fail to prevent the deportations.
It adds to more than 80 lawsuits by affected Afghans seeking German government approval for their visas, with courts siding with them in some cases, though the interior ministry has appealed those rulings.</p><small>2025-08-15 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15164201d0a9b53.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931054/us-pakistan-counterterrorism-talks-will-help-formulate-joint-action-plan-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>US-Pakistan counterterrorism talks will help formulate joint action plan: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday said that counterterrorism dialogue between Pakistan and the United States will help in formulating a joint action plan amid strengthening ties between the two countries.
According to a statement by the interior ministry today, Naqvi met with US Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo. Both officials discussed bilateral relations and agreeed to increase cooperation in various fields, including counterterrorism, border security and counter-narcotics,
“The counterterrorism dialogue will help in formulating a joint action plan,” the statement quoted Naqvi as saying during the meeting. The minister hoped for “positive results of Pak-US cooperation in eliminating terrorism”.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, Acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker and the federal interior secretary were also present on the occasion, it added.
“There has been an extraordinary improvement in Pak-US relations after the coming to power of President Donald Trump,” Naqvi said.
He praised US President Donald Trump’s efforts for world peace and stated, “The elements of transparency, mutual trust and cooperation are prominent in Pak-US relations.”
“This is a great opportunity to promote mutual relations in every field,” he added.
The interior minister also welcomed the recent US decision to designate the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army and the Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations, terming the development as a “good step”.
The statement said that LoGerfo expressed condolences over the loss of lives in terrorist attacks and quoted him as saying: “Pakistan is a very important country in geo-strategic terms.”
On Tuesday, the US said that it was committed to combat terrorism in all its forms with Pakistan, as UN Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo co-chaired the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue.¶
The last US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue was held in May 2024, where both countries reaffirmed the continuation of counterterrorism cooperation to advance regional and global security and stability.
Last week, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations. He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have an official face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
The two had discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington. During the meeting, Trump had “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”.</p><small>2025-08-15 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1514435379b48ea.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931055/pm-shehbaz-inaugurates-chinese-textile-groups-special-economic-zone-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz inaugurates Chinese textile group’s special economic zone in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday inaugurated a special economic zone (SEZ) in Islamabad to be set up by a Chinese textile group — projected to generate exports worth $400 million for the country, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China, which has supported it through many investments and development projects, such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which, currently in its second phase, has been termed a “lifeline” for the country’s economy. The phase II of the program is expected to focus on industrialisation, spe­c­ial economic zones, clean ene­rgy, agriculture and livelihood projects.
PM Shehbaz welcomed the establishment of an SEZ, saying that the “initiative would facilitate technology transfer, skill development, and sustainable industrial growth”.
The project will be set up by the Chinese textile group Challenge Fashion Private Limited, which is set to invest $100m over five years in the project.
PM Shehbaz met with the company’s delegation — led by its chairman Huwang Weiguo, expressing Pakistan’s willingness to “take bilateral ties to new heights”, APP quoted him as saying.
 






Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Jam Kamal, Attaullah Tarar, Ali Pervez Malik, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi were also present at the meeting.
The prime minister assured the delegation of his government’s complete facilitation for setting up the zone as part of the “industrial component of CPEC”, and thanked the delegation for having faith in the Pakistani market, APP reported.
PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s desire to set up more such units across the country and hoped to benefit from China’s textile sector.
 






On that note, he shared that “a China-Pakistan Business-to-Business Conference would soon be held in China, providing an opportunity for collaboration between private businesses of both countries,” APP reported him as saying.
Chairman Huwang said he aims to establish a modern textile industry in Pakistan and thanked the PM for his support and hospitality.
In July, at a high-level meeting, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal assured a Chinese delegation that the establishment of SEZs remains the federal government’s top priority.
While earlier this year, the Sindh government signed an agreement with Chinese and local investors to establish the Dhabeji SEZ under CPEC Phase II.</p><small>2025-08-15 10:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/151318504de7ee1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931048/pakistan-takes-stand-for-equitable-access-to-green-finance-for-developing-nations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan takes stand for ‘equitable access’ to green finance for developing nations</strong></a><br><p>Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Minister Dr Musadik Malik called for equitable access to green financing and other resources for developing nations at a meeting in Geneva on Friday, state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
He chaired the meeting on the sidelines of the fifth session of the plastic pollution treaty negotiations taking place in Geneva. Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit brought delegates from 185 countries to finalise a global treaty to control plastic pollution.
“Pakistan led a regional dialogue with Bangladesh, Egypt, Tajikistan, Malaysia, and Sudan for an interactive briefing,” according to a statement posted by Malik’s team on X.
“Minister Musadik called for a fair Global Plastics Treaty and equitable green financing, so support reaches nations most impacted by pollution and climate challenges,” the statement added.
 






At the meeting, the climate minister noted, “those responsible for the highest levels of plastic consumption are often the largest beneficiaries of green financing.” However, he added that the world’s poorest nations are often left to fend for themselves in the fight against climate change.
“Developing nations carry the heaviest burden of their environmental and socio-economic impacts,” APP quoted him as saying.
In a bid to rally the region towards fair and equitable green financing at the global plastics talks, the minister called for the treaty to take into consideration and prioritise “countries most affected by climate change and plastic pollution”.
Malik was of the opinion that “without fair access to resources and technology, developing nations cannot meet the environmental goals set by the global community”.
“By pushing for a united regional stance, Pakistan aims to strengthen the negotiating position of developing countries and ensure that the treaty addresses both environmental and economic fairness,” APP reported.
On Wednesday, Dr Musadik Malik had floated the idea of setting up a ‘global plastic fund’ for a marketplace to buy and sell plastic credits, receiving quite a few nods and thumbs up from delegates at the talks.
“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
World plastic pollution treaty talks collapse with no deal
Talks aimed at striking a landmark global treaty on plastic pollution fell apart on Friday without agreement, as countries failed to find consensus on how the world should tackle the ever-growing scourge, AFP reported.
Negotiators from 185 nations worked beyond Thursday’s deadline and through the night in an ultimately futile search for common ground between nations wanting bold action, such as curbing plastic production, and oil-producing states preferring to focus more narrowly on waste management.
The talks in Geneva — called after the collapse of the fifth and supposedly final round of talks in South Korea late last year — opened on August 5.
Several countries voiced bitter disappointment as the talks unravelled, but said they were prepared for future negotiations — despite six rounds of talks over three years now having failed to find agreement.
“We have missed a historic opportunity, but we have to keep going and act urgently. The planet and present and future generations need this treaty,” said Cuba.
A cluster of mostly oil-producing states calling themselves the Like-Minded Group — including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia — want the treaty to have a much narrower remit.
“Our views were not reflected… without an agreed scope, this process cannot remain on the right track and risks sliding down a slippery slope,” said Kuwait.
Bahrain said it wanted a treaty that “does not penalise developing countries for exploiting their own resources”.</p><small>2025-08-15 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15125322a119be0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931044/pakistan-establishes-diplomatic-ties-with-federated-states-of-micronesia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan establishes diplomatic ties with Federated States of Micronesia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the Federated States of Micronesia have formally established diplomatic relations to open up avenues for bilateral cooperation.
The Federated States of Micronesia are an island nation located in the western Pacific Ocean that joined the United Nations in 1991, according to the UN’s website.
Both countries’ permanent representatives to the UN signed an agreement at a ceremony in New York, the Pakistan Mission to the UN said in a press release on Thursday.
“Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, and Federated States of Micronesia’s counterpart, Ambassador Jeem S. Lippwe, signed a joint communiqué to formalise the relationship between the two countries,” the Pakistan Mission said.
 






Addressing the ceremony, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “The relations would open up avenues for cooperation in the field of human resource management, capacity building and climate change.”
Both Missions would “work closely on key matters, especially promotion of international peace and security” at the UN, the envoy highlighted.
He praised that the development came on Pakistan’s Independence Day anniversary and that it was the 100th country to forge ties with Micronesia.
Ambassador Lippwe “expressed his happiness on the start of a new chapter in bilateral relations”, according to the Pakistan Mission statement.
While thanking Pakistan for extending support to his country, the ambassador said he “looked forward to working closely with his Pakistani counterpart to strengthen [the] bond of friendship”.
The Mission statement noted that Ambassadors Ahmad and Lippwe held a brief meeting before the ceremony, where they discussed “matters of mutual interest, including possible areas of cooperation both bilaterally as well as at the UN”.
The signing ceremony was attended by the two countries’ diplomats, including  Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon.
 






In Dec 2024, Pakistan joined a coalition spearheaded by small island Pacific states to push for a new treaty focused on managing an equitable phase-out of fossil fuels and financing a global just transition away from the threat of coal, oil and gas production.
Pakistan was the first South Asian state to engage with this group to “understand the contours of the proposal for a Fossil Fuel Treaty, aimed at fairly winding down fossil fuel production”.
The 16-strong group has members across four continents, including Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Niue, Antigua and Barbuda, Timor-Leste, Palau, Colombia, Samoa, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Pakistan, and the Bahamas.</p><small>2025-08-15 08:24</small></div><hr>
