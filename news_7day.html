Reports said the incident took place near a petrol pump near GBS, as Fawad was headed to his office.
The four security guards who were injured in the attack were rushed to DHQ Hospital. However, hospital authorities referred a critically injured guard to Faisalabad, but he succumbed to his injuries.
Jhang police, meanwhile, arrested four suspects, including two alleged gunmen and Fawad’s stepbrother, a statement from a police spokesperson read.
Police said that Fawad and his stepbrother were travelling in separate convoys when their vehicles collided with each other. The collision triggered a scuffle between guards from both groups.
The gunmen of another suspect, who was travelling with the stepbrother, allegedly opened fire on Fawad’s group, shooting four of his guards, the statement added.
Quoting Jhang District Police Officer Bilal Iftikhar Kayani, the statement read that strict action is being taken against the suspects and that “no concession would be made to those who challenge the law”.
“Turning a minor dispute into violence and firing is a threat to the peace of the society,” DPO Kayani was quoted as saying.
Recounting the incident on camera, Fawad said that he and his guards were unarmed at the time, as they were not allowed to carry weapons.



Meanwhile, Waqas issued a statement on his X account condemning the incident as a “cowardly and planned attack”.
“It is extremely alarming that a peaceful city, which had become a cradle of peace due to our collective efforts over the past several years, is today being dragged back into unrest due to a few miscreants and rogue elements,” Waqas wrote.
“I make an unequivocal demand from the Punjab Police that all suspects involved in the incident be arrested immediately, transparent and impartial investigations be ensured, and those responsible be given exemplary punishment in accordance with the law,” he added.







In a later statement, Waqas said that the deceased guard’s family blocked Gujranwala Road and placed his body in front of Jhang Civil Hospital.
“We stand with his family and will fully support him,” the PTI information secretary wrote. “We will never leave them alone—we will ensure Mohsin’s family gets justice and will knock on every door of justice.”







Reports said that over the past six months, Fawad’s stepbrother had joined hands with the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) to contest elections against Waqas and his father, provincial lawmaker Sheikh Muhammad Akram.
The GDA had also recently announced they would contest all future elections against the Sheikh family.</p><small>2026-01-02 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02212500d902834.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964684/pm-shehbaz-has-not-set-a-minus-imran-condition-says-sanaullah-referring-to-negotiations' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz has not set a ‘minus Imran’ condition, says Sanaullah, referring to negotiations</strong></a><br><p>With the political impasse continuing among the country’s main stakeholders, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had not imposed any “minus Imran” condition on political engagement.
A day earlier, the premier’s adviser had proposed “confidence-building measures” between the leadership of the PML-N, the PTI, and the PPP could bring down political temperatures.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz has not set any condition of minus Imran Khan [from politics]. We neither seek to minus anyone nor consider it politically viable. Similar efforts were made to sideline us in the past,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan.
As the leader of the House, PM Shehbaz has offered negotiations to the opposition, saying they [PTI] should sit with him as dialogue is key to parliamentary democracy, Sanaullah added.
Maintaining that the opposition PTI had to take a step forward, the senior PML-N leader said that dialogue on behalf of the president, the PML-N supremo and the establishment was the premier’s “responsibility”.
“The PM has invited the opposition to meet in the National Assembly chamber if they do not want to visit [his office],” he added.
When asked about the statement he made a day earlier, Sanaullah said the prime minister must have taken Nawaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and the establishment in to confidence before extending the offer of dialogue to the opposition.
Sanaullah added that despite efforts by Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) and PTI’s second- and third-tier leadership to initiate talks, nothing could materialise unless “Imran Khan’s policy changes in favour of dialogue”.
The PM’s adviser noted that the PTI founder had not authorised anyone to hold negotiations, adding that his message, conveyed by his sister Aleema Khan, was that “anyone who talks about negotiations is not among us”.
“He sent a message of street agitation and a wheel-jam strike, and also asked Sohail Afridi to visit Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh for mobilisation,” he said, reiterating that Imran was the sole “hindrance” in negotiations.
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0222390797d3af5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964687/four-decomposed-bodies-recovered-from-ditch-in-karachis-mai-kolachi' target='_blank'><strong>Four decomposed bodies recovered from ditch in Karachi’s Mai Kolachi</strong></a><br><p>Police and rescue services recovered four decomposed bodies from a ditch on Karachi’s Mai Kolachi Road on Friday night.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza said four bodies were found in a deep ditch covered with bushes on the “jungle side” of the road in the limits of Docks police station.
Police rushed to the scene after receiving information from a scavenger about the presence of the bodies. Upon recovery, it was found that they were 10-15 days old and had decomposed. Two of the bodies were male and the other two female.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson in a statement said one of the deceased appeared to be a boy.
“The bodies have been sent to a hospital for legal formalities and the police are investigating the case from all aspects,” DIG Raza added.
Earlier this week, the body of an employee of the University of Karachi, stuffed in a gunny bag, was found at a desolate place in Safoora Town.
The police said that it appeared that the victim was bludgeoned to death.
A police officer elaborated that the victim was an employee of the H.E.J. Research Institute at KU. He had been living in the staff town of the varsity but had recently shifted to Sachal Goth.</p><small>2026-01-02 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/022036300d8b6f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964686/inquiry-ordered-after-teenage-girl-allegedly-killed-in-crossfire-between-police-suspected-robbers-in-karachis-landhi' target='_blank'><strong>Inquiry ordered after teenage girl allegedly killed in crossfire between police, suspected robbers in Karachi’s Landhi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Police on Friday launched an inquiry into the death of a teenage girl in Karachi’s Landhi area, who was struck and killed by a stray bullet while travelling in a rickshaw. Her relatives alleged that she was killed in the crossfire of a gunfight between police and suspected robbers.
Landhi Station House Officer (SHO) Salahuddin Qazi told Dawn that a 17-year-old resident of the Lines Area had accompanied her mother to visit a relative in Landhi.
She was returning home in a rickshaw when a bullet passed through the vehicle and struck her in the chest. She sustained critical wounds and was transported to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced her dead.
The victim’s uncle told media persons at the hospital that his niece was gunned down during crossfire between police and suspects in the area.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the girl was dead on arrival at the hospital and added that her family did not permit any medico-legal procedures and took the body.
Inquiry ordered
Taking notice of the incident, Korangi Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari set up an inquiry committee led by Landhi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Faiza Sodhar and comprising the Landhi and Awami Colony SHOs.
“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough and transparent inquiry about the incident and submit a report immediately,” a police spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement added that personnel from Awami Colony police station chased a group of suspects who allegedly committed a robbery outside a bank in the Korangi area. The suspects allegedly resorted to indiscriminate firing on the police team.
The police continued chasing the suspects, wounding one of them in the gunfight, while his accomplice managed to escape. Police recovered a pistol and a mobile phone from the wounded suspect.
According to the statement, police later received information that the teenager was shot and injured in the gunfight.
Landhi SHO Salahuddin Qazi, who is also a member of the inquiry team, told Dawn that the initial probe revealed a discrepancy in timing between the two incidents.
He explained that the girl sustained a “straight bullet wound” at around 11:30am, while the Awami Colony SHO claimed that the encounter took place around 1pm.
Police also claimed that the deceased girl’s uncle, in a written statement, told the police and doctors that “this was an incident”, adding that they did not want any legal proceedings.
This is not the first instance of a bystander getting killed in the crossfire between police and criminals. Last October, two passersby were killed in a crossfire between two groups that clashed at Khyber Chowk in Karachi’s Ittehad Town area.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that armed men from the Mehsud and Afridi tribes fired on each other after a quarrel between their children.
The officer said that the passersby were wounded in the crossfire and were rushed to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, where they succumbed during treatment.</p><small>2026-01-02 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01220617ba5cfdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964487/drone-swarms-test-kp-police-limits' target='_blank'><strong>‘Drone swarms’ test KP police limits</strong></a><br><p>As unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, become ubiquitous in modern battlefields, their use by militants in the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has given them an apparent edge over the police, who are currently using anti-drone technology to intercept ‘swarms’ of quadcopters.
For decades, Pakistan has been fighting against militants, particularly in KP, utilising all available resources to defeat an invisible enemy, which relies on guerrilla tactics for deadly and unpredictable strikes.

After years of reliance on suicide bombers, gun-and-bomb attacks, and improvised explosive devices, the militants have now increasingly turned towards ‘drone warfare’ to evade authorities and to inflict maximum damage.

 

Experts believe the impetus for this shift in strategy stems from the Russia-Ukraine war, where drones have played an effective role, particularly in targeting installations deep inside the enemy territory.In response to the drones, the police deployed anti-drone guns in multiple districts across the province and subsequently two anti-drone systems in Peshawar and the restive Bannu district.
IGP Zulfiqar Hameed said 76 quadcopter attacks were foiled by the police using anti-drone guns, fearing such attacks will grow in the days to come.

The problem is that the anti-drone guns can only jam one or two drones at the same time, and to bypass these guns, the militants have shifted towards ‘drone swarms’, making it difficult for law enforcement agencies to counter multiple quadcopters at once.

“After providing the anti-drone guns, militants started attacking from multiple sides. This is a technological war, and they [referring to militants], have now reduced the IED, VBIED attacks,” the KP police chief told Dawn.
He said the police did not operate drones to target militants, and as of now, their role remained defensive.
Anti-drone systems
As militants found a solution to the anti-drone guns, the police eventually deployed two anti-drone systems in Bannu and Peshawar, which, officials claim, were most effective in countering the swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles.
According to the data collected from several sources, 320 such attacks took place in Bannu district alone during the past year, followed by 21 in Bajaur, while 34 such drones targeted forces in North and South Waziristan. “The figure may be higher, but since there is no data available…(the number shared above) is just a count, not an officially verified document,” a senior officer said.
Former additional inspector general Akhtar Ali Shah said the militant groups had changed their strategy to capitalise on readily available quadcopters and carry out attacks. Their use of drones showed that the law enforcement agencies were no longer the “sole masters” of the sky.
However, a senior official believed that their anti-drone system was a significant improvement in countering such attacks. Officials from the police department, on condition of anonymity, said countering this type of drone warfare was manageable, albeit difficult.

According to an officer, they can successfully repel drone attacks, but the police cannot simultaneously take on militants on the ground as well as fend off the drones. Officials said Bannu Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel, Domel, and Bargnatu and villages adjacent to the Bannu cantonment are some of the spots under constant attack.
In a statement issued by the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan, militants carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured, while nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured.
However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised. “Technology can be countered with technology only,” another senior official privy to developments in Bannu, told Dawn.
According to him, drones give an edge to militants but at the same time, provide the forces an opportunity to identify the militants’ base since the operators are always in the proximity.

As drone use for surveillance and attacks grows in number, officials believe that the latest technology and structural changes are key to counter this threat.

For instance, the militants always deploy surveillance drones before attacking, and if all the open areas in the government installations are camouflaged, they will not be able to gather intel, they said.
Besides this, the authorities will install anti-drone technology to deter such incursions.

“2025 now joins 2022 and 2023 in the top three warmest years since 1884,” the Met Office said in a statement, noting the United Kingdom’s mean temperature through last year was 10.09C.
“This is an increasingly clear demonstration of the impacts of climate change on UK temperatures,” it added.
“It is also only the second year in this series where the UK’s annual mean temperature has exceeded 10.0C.” The previous record of 10.03C was set in 2022.
It means four of the UK’s last five years now appear in the top five warmest years since 1884, and all of the top ten hottest years will now have occurred in the last two decades.
The Met Office had already announced last month that 2025 was the country’s sunniest year since that record series began in 1910.
The UK — which comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — saw 1648.5 hours of sunshine, 61.4 hours more than the previous record set in 2003.
‘Exceptional’ sunshine
An “exceptional” amount of sunshine during the spring followed by long spells of clear skies during the summer helped set the record, the Met Office has noted.
But while England saw an unprecedented amount of sunshine, it was only the second sunniest in Scotland and Wales and the eighth sunniest in Northern Ireland.
Mark McCarthy, the Met Office’s head of climate attribution, said the “very warm” year was “in line with expected consequences of human-induced climate change”.
“Although it doesn’t mean every year will be the warmest on record, it is clear from our weather observations and climate models that human-induced global warming is impacting the UK’s climate,” he added.
The country experienced persistent spells of dry and sunny weather in 2025, with every month except January and September warmer than average.
Spring and then a summer featuring four heatwaves were Britain’s warmest on record, while spring was the driest in more than a century.
Droughts were declared in several regions, reservoir sites fell below 50 per cent of their usual capacity and a handful of water companies issued bans on using hosepipes.
Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle said: “Meteorologically, the warmth has been driven largely by persistent high-pressure systems bringing prolonged dry, sunny conditions, alongside above-average sea temperatures around the UK.
“These factors have combined to keep temperatures consistently higher than normal for much of the year.“</p><small>2026-01-02 15:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02202045f632134.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964683/yemens-government-launches-operation-against-southern-separatists' target='_blank'><strong>Yemen’s government launches operation against southern separatists</strong></a><br><p>Yemen’s Saudi-backed government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists on Friday and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province.
The operation in Hadramout marks the latest escalation in Yemen.
Hadramout’s governor, Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi, said in a statement on Friday that his forces had taken control of a military camp in al-Khasha’a, the largest and most important base in the province.
The governor had earlier said his forces were launching what he called a “peaceful” operation.
A senior official of the Southern Transitional Council told Reuters the operation had not been peaceful.
Yemen’s government said it had appointed Hadramout’s governor to take overall command of the “Homeland Shield” forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order.
This is not a declaration of war, the governor said in a speech on Yemen TV, adding that the move aims to prevent the use of camps to threaten security and to protect Hadramout from sliding into chaos.
The oil-producing Hadramout province borders Saudi Arabia and many prominent Saudis trace their origins to it, lending it cultural and historical significance for the kingdom.
A spokesperson for the STC, Mohammed al-Naqeeb, said on Friday that forces were on full alert across the region and warned that it was ready to respond forcefully in a post on X.







The STC told Reuters that three of the airstrikes targeted the al-Khasha’a military camp.
Three Yemeni sources told Reuters armoured vehicles belonging to the government had been moving towards the Khasha’a camp, which has the capacity to house thousands of troops and was taken over by the STC in December.
The STC, which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, which in turn saw the move as a threat.
The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours.
OPEC+ members will meet online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates have said they will extend a policy of maintaining first-quarter production unchanged.
Aden airport shut
Today, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden.
A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown.
“For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation … but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi,” the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X.







Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden’s airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land.
Aden’s international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.</p><small>2026-01-02 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0219322700f0350.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964678/utmanzai-tribe-holds-peace-rally-in-mir-ali-warns-of-civil-disobedience' target='_blank'><strong>Utmanzai tribe holds peace rally in Mir Ali, warns of civil disobedience</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Utmanzai tribe of North Waziristan staged a peace rally in Mir Ali on Friday and warned of launching a civil disobedience movement if its demands, including restoring peace, lifting the curfew, and reopening the Ghulam Khan border crossing, were not fulfilled by Jan 20.
Thousands of people from the tribe, along with other political and local leaders, gathered at Noor Islam Shaheed Chowk in Mir Ali, where Friday prayers were also offered, led by Member of the National Assembly Mufti Misbahuddin.
Speakers stressed that peace was a fundamental right of citizens and demanded that residents of North Waziristan be allowed to live peacefully like people in other parts of the country.
Misbahuddin told the rally that Waziristan could no longer withstand further military operations.
“Peace is the greatest blessing, and tribal elders have always cooperated with the state, but the authorities never appear serious about restoring lasting stability,” he lamented.
Chief of Waziristan Jirga Malik Nasrullah said every child in the region yearned for peace and warned that if the government failed to act, the tribes would be compelled to announce “civil disobedience and block all internal and external routes”.
He also demanded compensation for damaged shops, and the immediate return of seized vehicles that had not paid customs duties.
“If affected drivers block roads in protest, Utmanzai elders and the public will fully support them.”
Nasrullah also criticised the placement of tribal elders on the Fourth Schedule, demanding the immediate removal of restrictions to allow them free movemen.
Addressing the gathering, Utmanzai tribes’ elders said, “The continued insecurity, restrictions on movement, and economic blockades have made life unbearable for the local population”.
They warned that if their demands were ignored, they would be left with no option but to resort to civil disobedience after the deadline.
Jamaat-e-Islami leader Malik Imshadullah said the region had endured more than “two decades of inconsistent policies”, marked by a persistent gap between the “state’s commitments and actions”.
Awami National Party leader Malik Nisar Ali Khan urged the authorities to allow the youth of the region to live normal lives.
Utmanzai tribe’s spokesperson, Mufti Baitullah Aman, said peace was a sacred demand, adding that Islam placed great emphasis on security and human dignity.
“The people are asking for peace, not confrontation,” he said, calling on the state to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities.
Participants demanded that the police be empowered and all check-posts handed over to them, while security forces should focus on border security.
They also urged militant groups to stay away from populated areas, saying “homes, shops, hospitals, and other civilian properties cannot be turned into bunkers or occupied by force”.
Elders also called for the reopening of the Ghulam Khan border terminal for trade with Afghanistan, stating that nearly 20,000 people depended on cross-border trade for their livelihoods.
Other demands included lifting restrictions on development projects, ending what they described as discriminatory treatment, and immediately ending the curfew.
They said if restrictions were unavoidable, they should be limited to Sundays only, adding that curfews under Section 144 after 10pm on Saturdays were unacceptable.
Elders claimed thousands of residents had their passports and national identity cards blocked and demanded their immediate restoration, alleging that heavy bribes were being demanded for unblocking documents.
The rally concluded with a unanimous warning that if their demands were not accepted, a campaign of “civil disobedience and social boycott” would be launched after the January 20.
In May last year, the locals in North Waziristan also staged a sit-in for days, protesting against a suspected drone strike that killed four children.
Later, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, had clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned TTP.
Last year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.</p><small>2026-01-02 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/022015405305ecc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964682/why-men-must-pay-closer-attention-to-cardiac-health' target='_blank'><strong>Why men must pay closer attention to cardiac health</strong></a><br><p>Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death among men globally, and South Asian countries are no exception. As men continue to balance careers, family, and daily pressures, their hearts often bear the silent strain. Experts remind us that understanding and protecting men’s cardiac health is not just a medical need but a matter of self-care and longevity.
Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman is a Medicine Specialist and a Cardiologist at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). He notes that the majority of cardiac cases he encounters involve men above the age of forty.

Dr Rahman explains that the difference between men’s and women’s heart health begins with hormones. Women benefit from the protective effects of oestrogen, which usually helps maintain healthy blood vessels and cholesterol levels.
Men, however, lack this hormonal shield. As a result, they are naturally more susceptible to ischemic heart disease (IHD) from an earlier age. Once women reach menopause and oestrogen levels drop, their risk becomes nearly identical.
“Hormonal protection gives women a head start,” Dr Rahman says. “Men, without that advantage, face heart-related risks much sooner, especially if unhealthy habits come into play.”
The lifestyle link
While biology sets the stage, daily habits often determine the outcome.
“Many men also compromise food quality because they are always on the go,” notes Dr Rahman. “Add irregular sleep, stress, and addictive habits like smoking, and you have a combination that quietly damages the heart over time.”
Stress itself plays a major role. With modern work-life demands, men often shoulder significant financial and emotional pressures, leading to hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genetics can intensify this risk further. Men with a family history of cardiac problems are particularly vulnerable and should begin routine screenings earlier than others.
Common conditions and overlooked symptoms
Among South Asian men, the most frequently diagnosed heart conditions include coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension. These typically develop silently, progressing over years before showing clear warning signs.
“The problem is that men often do not take minor symptoms seriously,” Dr Rahman warns. “Headaches, easy fatigue, chest discomfort, or swelling in the feet are not just signs of tiredness. They can be the heart’s way of asking for help.”
Other early indicators include shortness of breath or decreased productivity at work. When left unchecked, these symptoms can escalate into severe cardiac events. Dr Rahman emphasises that awareness and timely response can prevent a tragedy.
“Many heart attacks could have been avoided if men had sought medical attention earlier,” he adds.
The need for early diagnosis
One of Rahman’s strongest messages is the importance of early screening. “Early diagnosis makes a big difference. It can significantly prevent or slow down the severity of heart disease,” he says firmly. “Prevention is always better than a cure.”
He advises men over 40, especially those with a family history of heart disease, to undergo annual check-ups. Simple tests such as blood pressure measurement, lipid profiles, ECGs, and stress tests can uncover silent risk factors long before symptoms appear.
“Cardiac issues don’t appear overnight,” Rahman explains. “They develop gradually. The earlier you identify them, the better chance you have to protect your heart.”
)
Small changes, big impact
While the idea of an overhauled lifestyle can sound daunting, Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman insists that heart protection does not require radical change; it requires consistency.
“Start with what you can control,” he advises. “Quit smoking, choose home-cooked meals over processed or oily food. Even small steps, if done regularly, make a real difference.”
Exercise remains one of the most effective tools for maintaining heart health. Cardiologists recommend at least 30 to 45 minutes of physical activity several times a week, whether it’s brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling.
Dr Rahman adds that the mental benefits are equally important: “Exercise helps release stress, which in turn keeps blood pressure and heart rhythm in check.”
In addition, managing stress through exercise, mindfulness, adequate rest, and time away from screens can improve cardiovascular function.
Too often, men ignore their symptoms or delay medical consultations out of fear or overconfidence.
“It’s time to change that mindset,” Dr Rahman says. “Health is not about appearing tough. It’s about being wise enough to care for yourself.”
Heart health, he stresses, is a lifelong responsibility, not a short-term goal. Early prevention, annual check-ups, and mindful habits are the pillars of a stronger, longer life.
Men often devote their energy to providing for others but forget that their own health forms the foundation of everything they do.
Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman concludes, “Your health is not an expense but an investment. Care for your heart now, and it will take care of you for years to come.”

The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest.
Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia.
The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws.
According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station.
Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station.
The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage or abetting in waging war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences.
They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC.
Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC.
They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences.
In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders.
The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentences handed out to them were to run concurrently.
“The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said.
The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”.
During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused.
Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court.
A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences.
The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023.
The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest.
Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023.
Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases.
“At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”.
“The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-02 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02180859a4ee5c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964676/ex-information-secretary-ambreen-jan-selected-to-head-pemra' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-information secretary Ambreen Jan selected to head Pemra</strong></a><br><p>Ambreen Jan, former information secretary, was selected on Friday as the new chairperson of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), which will make her the first female head of the electronic media regulator once her appointment is confirmed.
The previous head of the regulator, Mohammad Saleem Baig, was appointed in 2018 and retired last year, leaving the post vacant.
A meeting of a parliamentary committee, chaired by Shehbaz Babar, selected Jan after it was convened to appoint the next head of the influential media regulatory authority.
Following the committee’s unanimous approval, Jan’s name was forwarded to President Asif Ali Zardari for final confirmation.
A former Grade 22 officer, Jan has also previously served as the managing director of the state broadcaster PTV, the director general of Radio Pakistan and press counsellor to Bangladesh while relations were strained from 2011 to 2018.
She was among five shortlisted candidates considered for the post, including Brigadier (retd.) Anwar Ahmed, Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf, and Dr Hamid Khan.

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
“In Pakistan, the supermoon will rise at 5:51pm PKT on the evening of Jan 3, with an illumination of 99.8pc, and remains visible throughout the nights of Jan 3 and 4,” read the statement.
During the current event, which marks the final supermoon of the cycle that began in October 2025, the Earth–Moon distance will be approximately 362,312 kilometers, making the moon appear about 6 to 7 per cent larger and up to 10 per cent brighter than a typical full moon, it stated.
Supermoons typically occur in sequences of three to four consecutive events, with the current cycle concluding with the January 3 supermoon. The next cycle starts in November 2026.
In 2025, the first of the three supermoons lit up the country’s skies on October 7, followed by another on November 5, called the Beaver supermoon. The last supermoon of the year was visible across Pakistan on December 4 and 5.</p><small>2026-01-02 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02121222e58e180.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964653/ex-imran-aide-shahzad-akbar-says-uk-residence-subjected-to-deliberate-targeted-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-Imran aide Shahzad Akbar says UK residence subjected to ‘deliberate, targeted’ attack</strong></a><br><p>Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home.
In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”.







Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”.
He held that the incidents were not isolated.
“I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled.
He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”.
“The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said.
In response to a written query from Dawn regarding Akbar’s statement on the latest incident, a London Counter-Terrorism Policing (CTP) spokesperson’s reply appeared to address last week’s assault on the ex-PM’s aide.
“Officers from CTP London are investigating an assault of a man in his 50s, which happened in the Cambridge area on the morning of December 24.
“The investigation was passed to CTP London due to what appears to be the highly targeted nature of the assault against the victim. At this stage, however, we retain an open mind as to any potential motivation behind the attack. There is not believed to be any wider threat to the public in connection with this incident,“ the spokesperson said.
No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains ongoing, the spokesperson added.
Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, said last week that an unk­nown assailant dressed in “construction or waste-collection attire” attacked him in Cambridge.
“The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me,” Akbar posted on X. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.”







The former accountability adviser termed the assault “cowardly” and urged the British government to ensure the safety of dissidents.
“Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out,” he wrote, vowing to continue exposing “corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan”.
This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”.
Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.</p><small>2026-01-02 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0217065295607fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964674/spectrum-starved-country-it-minister-says-govt-to-auction-600-mhz-spectrum-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>‘Spectrum-starved country’: IT minister says govt to auction 600 MHz spectrum next month</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced on Friday that Pakistan would auction the 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum next month to provide better internet speeds and roll out 5G in the country.
In a meeting last week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the process of auctioning the 600 MHz spectrum within two months.
“The spectrum available for our telecom industry is extremely limited,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad, and added that telcos “provide services in the country using just the 274 MHz”.
“We are a spectrum-starved country,” she said.
“We are a country of 240 million people with only 274 MHz of spectrum,” she stated, adding that “Bangladesh, with about two-thirds of Pakistan’s population, provides 600 MHz.”

         View this post on Instagram            

The spectrum is the range of radio frequencies that carries wireless signals for mobile phones, the internet, TV, and radio. Mobile networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G operate by sending data over specific frequency bands within this spectrum. In South Asia, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka have launched 5G networks nationwide, while Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan have yet to do so.
The federal minister maintained that spectrum availability in Pakistan was the lowest in the region due to the absence of any major spectrum auction for many years.
“It will not only improve our 3G and 4G services, but also introduce 5G in Pakistan for the first time,” she elaborated.
The federal minister emphasised that the internet was “critical infrastructure,” like roads used to be in the past.
“The internet plays a crucial role in the development of the social sector, large-scale economic policies, and national and personal security. Without this [600MHz] level of connectivity, we cannot move forward,” she maintained.
The IT minister said that it is vital to perceive the internet and connectivity as an “enabling tool” that will unlock the country’s “ economic potential and create employment”.
Last week, during a press conference alongside the finance minister, Khawaja said that the government was trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February.
The federal minister said that in the auction, additional bands were being offered in Pakistan for the first time, which would not only improve 3G and 4G quality but also ensure the rollout of 5G services.
She stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.
In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction presented its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600 MHz band.
The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.</p><small>2026-01-02 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02181027cba036e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964665/iranian-official-reacts-to-trumps-statement-on-protests-warns-us-interference-would-mean-destabilising-region' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian official reacts to Trump’s statement on protests, warns US interference ‘would mean destabilising region’</strong></a><br><p>After US President Donald Trump warned Iran on Friday of intervention if authorities in the Middle Eastern country “violently kill” peaceful protesters, a top official of the Islamic Republic said any interference by Washington would mean “destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests”.
“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
Reacting to his statement, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, posted on X: “With the statements by Israeli officials and Donald Trump, what has been going on behind the scenes is now clear.
“We distinguish between the stance of the protesting shopkeepers and the actions of disruptive actors, and Trump should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests.”







He added, “The American people should know — Trump started this adventurism. They should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety.”
These statements follow the deaths of several people as Iran’s biggest protests in three years over economic hardship turned violent across multiple provinces.
The clashes between protesters and security forces mark a significant escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protesting on Sunday over the government’s handling of a sharp currency slide and rapidly rising prices.
Iran’s economy has struggled for years since the US reimposed sanctions in 2018, after Trump withdrew from an international nuclear agreement during his first term.
Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Larijani, said that US interference in Iranian protests would lead to chaos across the region.</p><small>2026-01-02 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021523292fb9202.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964669/ecp-sends-notice-to-shafiullah-jan-seeks-explanation-over-haripur-by-poll-allegations' target='_blank'><strong>ECP sends notice to Shafiullah Jan, seeks explanation over Haripur by-poll allegations</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday sent a notice to the Adviser to the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Shafiullah Jan, seeking an explanation for his statement blaming the electoral body for irregularities during the Haripur by-elections last year, sources said.
During a press conference on December 19, Jan blamed the ECP for electoral irregularities, and claimed Form 47 was issued from Islamabad instead of the returning officer’s office.
“This was a singular yet bizarre event in the country’s history, when a Form-47 was issued from Islamabad,” adding that “ECP didn’t upload all Form-45s from 602 polling stations in the constituency, nor could the PML-N produce all Form-45s from 602 polling stations.”
Sources said the ECP, in its notice, said “baseless” allegations were made against the commission concerning the conduct of the Haripur by-elections, including the issuance of Form-47 from Islamabad, the non-uploading of Form-45 on its website, and other claims of irregularities.
They further added that the electoral body had reviewed the matter and “is of the considered view that allegations made in the said statement are incorrect, misleading, and not supported by any evidence”.
Sources saud that such statements, when made publicly without any verifiable evidence, create “unnecessary confusion and adversely affect public confidence” in the electoral process.
“It appears to be an attempt to malign the institution.”
Jan has been directed to explain his position regarding the statements he made and provide “concrete and verifiable” evidence to support his claim within the next seven days.
Appropriate action, in accordance with the law, will be taken against Jan if he fails to provide evidence during the stipulated time period, said sources.
In November, by-elections were held for six national and seven provincial assembly seats, in which PML-N secured almost all the seats except one. However, the opposition party PTI alleged rigging and rejected the results.
For the NA-18 (Haripur) seat, PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub, was defeated by PML-N’s Babar Nawaz.
The seat was vacated by Omar Ayub Khan upon his disqualification by the ECP over convictions in various cases.
The Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), an electoral monitoring body, also reported that by-elections were marred by “recurring violations” of campaigning restrictions and “gaps” in results transparency.</p><small>2026-01-02 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02164422bdcb22a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964672/contaminated-water-kills-9-hospitalises-200-in-indias-indore' target='_blank'><strong>Contaminated water kills 9, hospitalises 200 in India’s Indore</strong></a><br><p>At least nine people have died and more than 200 have been hospitalised in the central Indian city of Indore after a diarrhoea outbreak that officials said was linked to contaminated drinking water, according to a lawmaker and local health authorities.
Kailash Vijayvargiya, a lawmaker, said nine people had died in Indore.
Indore’s chief medical officer, Madhav Prasad Hasani, told Reuters by phone that drinking water in the Bhagirathpur area of the city was contaminated due to a leak and a water test had confirmed the presence of bacteria in the pipeline.
“I cannot say anything on the death toll, but yes, over 200 people from the same locality are undergoing treatment at different hospitals of the city. The final report of the water sample collected from the affected area is awaited,” Hasani said.
Shravan Verma, the district administrative officer, said authorities had deployed teams of doctors for door-to-door screening and were distributing chlorine tablets to help purify water.
“We have found one leakage point that could have contaminated the water and that point has been fixed,” Verma said, adding that officials had screened 8,571 people and identified 338 with mild symptoms.

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza.







These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip.
Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains, and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave.
Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions.
In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said.
It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.”
“Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.”
The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances.
They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.
“Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said.
The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year. They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. 
They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions.
The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.”
The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.</p><small>2026-01-02 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02150510d30d45d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964663/female-biker-killed-after-being-hit-by-trailer-in-karachis-landhi-driver-flees' target='_blank'><strong>Female biker killed after being hit by trailer in Karachi’s Landhi; driver flees</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Heavy vehicles’ reign of terror continued in the metropolis on Thursday as a female motorcyclist was killed after being hit by a trailer.
In recent months, the city has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
Quaidabad’s Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammad Ali Shah told Dawn that the driver of a 10-wheeler hit the 20-year-old female motorcyclist on the main Mehran Highway near MN Textile in Landhi.
“She suffered critical injuries and died on the spot,” Shah said.
“The driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the police,” he said.
The body was moved to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities.

 

Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said that a 60-year-old man was killed when a trailer truck hit him in Defence Phase 1 near the Akhtar Colony signal on Thursday night.
The statement added that since January 1, three people had been killed in accidents, while 70 others, including 10 children and 20 women, had been injured.
Friday’s development comes as a ban on the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi has been extended till Feb 22.
On Saturday, four people, including two brothers, were killed in three different accidents on the Super Highway, officials said.
The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2026-01-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021335542d653ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964660/regard-taiwan-as-an-inalienable-part-of-china-pakistan-reiterates' target='_blank'><strong>Regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China, Pakistan reiterates</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reiterated that Pakistan regarded Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.
The statement from FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi came in response to media queries seeking Pakistan’s response to “developments in the Taiwan Strait”.
“Pakistan and China are iron-clad friends and all-weather strategic cooperative partners. We reiterate our consistent support to China on all matters of its core interests, including Taiwan,“ he said.
“We will continue to adhere to the One-China principle and regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China,” he said.







The FO spokesperson had made similar remarks during yesterday’s weekly press briefing in response to a question regarding the sale of arms to Taiwan by the United States.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan rejects China’s claims.
Although the statement released by the FO on Friday did not make a specific mention of the exact developments it was referring to, it comes after China completed military drills around Taiwan that included live-fire exercises aimed at simulating a blockade of key ports and assaults on maritime targets.
The US State Department on Thursday said the Chinese war games around Taiwan “unnecessarily” spiked tensions in the region, calling on Beijing to “cease its military pressure”.
“China’s military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan and others in the region increase tensions unnecessarily. We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p><small>2026-01-02 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02124422624bf6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964646/swiss-face-painful-task-of-identifying-victims-of-deadly-bar-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Swiss face painful task of identifying victims of deadly bar fire</strong></a><br><p>Investigators raced on Friday to identify the victims of a fire that ripped through a bar in the Swiss Alps town of Crans-Montana, turning a New Year’s celebration into one of the country’s worst tragedies.
It is not yet clear what set off the blaze at Le Constellation, killing around 40 people and injuring about 115 others, many seriously.
Bystanders described scenes of panic and chaos as people tried to break the windows to escape and others, covered in burns, poured into the street.
Swiss police warned it could take days or even weeks to identify everyone who perished, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.
“We’ve tried to reach our friends. We took loads of photos and posted them on Instagram, Facebook, all possible social networks to try to find them,” said Eleonore, 17. “But there’s nothing. No response.”
“Even the parents don’t know,” she added.
The exact number of people who were at the bar when it went up in flames remains unclear, and police have not specified how many are still missing.
Le Constellation had a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website.
Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who took over on Thursday, called the fire “a calamity of unprecedented, terrifying proportions”, and announced that flags would be flown at half-mast for five days.
Local police commander Frederic Gisler said authorities were “in close contact with the victims’ families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved”.
“Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,” he told reporters.
The canton’s chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said significant resources have been deployed “to identify the victims and return their bodies to the families as quickly as possible”.
‘The apocalypse’
The fire broke out around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) Thursday at Le Constellation, a bar popular with young tourists.
“We thought it was just a small fire — but when we got there, it was war,” Mathys, from neighbouring Chermignon-d’en-Bas, told AFP. “That’s the only word I can use to describe it: the apocalypse. It was terrible.”
Authorities have declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy, saying only that it was not an attack.
Several witness accounts, broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media, meanwhile, pointed to sparklers that were apparently mounted on champagne bottles held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular “show” for patrons who made special orders to their tables.
There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire”, Axel, a witness present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team.
Pilloud said the investigation would look into whether the bar met safety standards and had the required number of exits.
Red and white caution tape, flowers and candles adorned the street where the tragedy occurred, while police shielded the site with white screens.
After the emergency units at the local hospitals filled up, many of the injured were transported across Switzerland and to neighbouring countries.
The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance, while French President Emmanuel Macron said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian broadcaster Rete 4 that around 15 Italians had been injured in the fire, and a similar number remained missing.
The French foreign ministry said nine French citizens figured among the injured, and eight others remained unaccounted for.
Multiple sources told AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe, but have been unreachable since the tragedy.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02120805447c59c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964655/hrcp-expresses-concern-at-roughing-up-of-youtuber-rajab-butt-during-court-appearance-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern at roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during court appearance in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week.
On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them.
A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him.
“The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X.







“Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said.
The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt.
Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.
On Tuesday, a group of lawyers had stormed the City Courts police station, manhandled a station house officer (SHO) and then staged a protest sit-in on M.A. Jinnah Road demanding an FIR against Mr Butt.
A day later, police had registered a criminal case against several lawyers, including Solangi, for allegedly assaulting the City Courts SHO after he lodged an FIR against them for assaulting Butt.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar.
It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021158133d39520.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964652/australias-usman-khawaja-to-retire-after-ashes-finale-slams-racial-stereotyping' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Usman Khawaja to retire after Ashes finale, slams ‘racial stereotyping’</strong></a><br><p>Usman Khawaja said on Friday he will retire from international cricket after the fifth and final Ashes clash against England, leaving a legacy as Australia’s first Muslim Test cricketer while lashing out at perceived “racial stereotyping” during his 15-year career.
The 39-year-old will pad up for the last time, should he be selected, when the Test gets under way in Sydney on Sunday, ending months of speculation about his future.
It would be an 88th Test for the classy left-hander, culminating a career where it began after making his debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2011, also against England.
“The number one emotion is contentment. I’m very lucky to have played so many games for Australia the way I have,” Khawaja said.
“I hope I have inspired people along the way.

“I’m a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now, and you can do the same.”

Khawaja immigrated to Australia from Islamabad as a child, battling the odds to become the country’s first Pakistan-born, and first Muslim, national player.
At one point, he was the only Asian first-class player in Australia and is credited as a role model who opened doors for others.
“Usman has made a huge contribution to Australian cricket both through his outstanding achievements as one of our most stylish and resilient batters since his Test debut 15 years ago, and off field, particularly through the Usman Khawaja Foundation,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg.
“On behalf of Australian cricket I would like to thank and congratulate Usman for all he has achieved.”
Khawaja’s foundation helps youths from refugee, immigrant, Indigenous, and poor socioeconomic backgrounds through introductory cricket programs and educational support.
‘Attacked me’
Khawaja, a qualified pilot, has plundered 6,206 runs in Test cricket with 16 centuries, averaging 43.39.
He smashed a career-high 232 against Sri Lanka a year ago, but has not made three figures since.
The current Ashes series has been a rollercoaster ride, with the veteran batsman coming under scrutiny.
He injured his back in the first Test in Perth and was replaced as opener in the second innings by Travis Head who blasted a match-winning century.
Khawaja did not feature in the next match at Brisbane and was omitted from the team for the third Test in Adelaide, only to get a lifeline when Steve Smith dropped out ill just before the toss.

         View this post on Instagram            

He came in at number four and hit 82 and 40 before making 29 and 0 in the fourth Test at Melbourne.
“I’m glad I get to leave on amy own terms, with a little bit of dignity, and go out at the SCG where I love,” he said, while expressing frustration at how he was treated.
“When I did my back (in Perth), I hurt my back and had back spasms and it was something I couldn’t control.
“The way the media and past players came out and attacked me. I could have copped it for a couple of days but it went on for five days.
“The way everyone came out at me about my preparation, ‘he’s not committed to the team. Only worried about himself. Playing a golf competition. He’s selfish, he didn’t train hard enough. He’s lazy’.
“These are the same racial stereotypes (I thought we had moved past).
“But obviously we haven’t fully moved past that. I haven’t seen anyone treated like that in the Australian cricket team before.”
He nevertheless admitted the writing was on the wall during the current Ashes series.
“Going into Adelaide and then not being picked initially for that game was probably a sign for me to say ‘all right, it’s time to move on’,” he said.
Khawaja also played 40 one-dayers and nine Twenty20 internationals.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021117432bf7e94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964651/canada-asks-air-india-to-probe-incident-of-pilot-reporting-for-duty-under-influence-of-alcohol-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Canada asks Air India to probe incident of pilot reporting for duty under influence of alcohol, source says</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s transport regulator has asked Air India to investigate an incident of a pilot reporting for duty under the influence of alcohol and failing two breathalyser tests, a person familiar with the matter said.
The tests were conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport, after the pilot was asked to leave the aircraft, the person said.
The incident was labelled as a “serious matter” by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India, and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added.
The person requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Transport Canada did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular working hours.
In a statement, Air India confirmed the flight from Vancouver to Delhi on December 23 experienced a last-minute delay due to the incident, adding that an alternate pilot was brought in to operate the flight.
“The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said.
“Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.”
The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said.
India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022.

 

Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny.
This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making.
The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters.
The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.</p><small>2026-01-02 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02075503f4e05c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964537/country-witnessed-34pc-increase-in-terrorism-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Country witnessed 34pc increase in terrorism in 2025</strong></a><br><p>• Pak Institute for Peace Studies report counts 699 terrorist attacks in outgoing year• Burden of violence fell on security personnel, constituting over 42pc of fatalities
ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.
These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday.
Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows.

 

The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives.
Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan.
In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured.
The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations.
Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance.
Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year.
These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others.

ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners.
The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy.
“We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said.
Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported.
Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day.
Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council.
At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”.
“So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said.
Exchange of lists
Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown.
Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.”
He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added.
India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani.
The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
“Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said.
Dulhasti power project
The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.

 

Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations.
“No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.”
The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart.
Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.”
He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

Police sources said tickets for the musical night were sold at Rs5,000 for families and Rs2,000 for individuals. However, tickets were allegedly sold beyond the venue’s capacity and adequate arrangements for spectators were not made.
As a result, the area reserved for spectators became overcrowded. A large number of ticket-holders also gathered outside the venue in an attempt to gain entry.
Security guards of the housing society stopped the gathering and did not allow them to enter the concert venue, prompting protests by the ticket-holders.
It has yet to be established how the protest turned violent and which side took the first step in disrupting law and order. A police contingent was deployed at the venue for security and crowd control, but it reportedly remained a silent spectator until the situation worsened.
During the protest, a physical confrontation broke out between the ticket-holders who were denied entry and the security guards. Both sides pelted stones at each other, while the guards also used batons to disperse the crowd.
The use of force further angered the gathering, which then began damaging property.
Police intervened when the situation went out of control and used force along with anti-riot gear to disperse the protesters. During the police action, a couple of protesters were picked up and taken to police installations.
Videos that went viral on social media showed some youngsters throwing stones at the guards and damaging property. In the clips, guards can also be seen chasing and manhandling some of the youths.
The housing society management had arranged the musical concert and sold tickets in different categories. Some participants alleged that despite purchasing tickets, they were not allowed entry, which became the initial cause of the disturbance.
Sources said the society management was planning to register an FIR, but no official complaint had been lodged so far. 
According to sources, the management told the police that they would come to lodge a complaint, but it remains unclear when this will happen.

Respected Auntie,
I am a gazetted officer in a well-reputed public sector organisation, where the source of income is limited to the salary. A few months ago, I started a part-time business venture, which was unsuccessful and I suffered losses. Because of that, I have been facing a hard time economically for the past few weeks. 
My father-in-law (also my elder paternal uncle) left behind a hefty agricultural land and a commercial property to his spouse and children. Following his death in 2017, I was married to his only daughter in 2019. Despite the passage of almost seven years, not even a single penny was transferred to my wife. 
I have four brothers-in-law, and my father-in-law considered his daughter equal to his son and declared that they would equally share the inheritance. But after his death, things have changed altogether. Two of my brothers-in-law have shifted abroad, using the resources of their father, while one has been given a separate home from the family one. The fourth one is living and enjoying the family pension and other facilities. 
We have three children, of which one goes to school. We live in an official residence, where the monthly rent is deducted from my salary. When I ask my wife to plead her [inheritance] case with her mother, she says that she feels uncomfortable and will not do it unless my mother-in-law considers it herself. 

‘How Do I Convince My Wife to Fight for Her Inheritance?’

Frustrated by the situation, I implicitly conveyed a message to my in-laws but in vain. Even though I did a lot for my brothers-in-laws, helping one get a job abroad and another free medical check-up. Despite this, I have hardly been regarded as their brother-in-law. Moreover, religiously, we belong from the Islamic school of thought where the rights of daughters exceed everything.
Deprived 
Dear Deprived,
Your wife’s right to her father’s inheritance is not charity and definitely not something she should feel embarrassed about. It is her legal right. The problem is that many daughters are conditioned to believe that asking for their own right is greedy. Her silence is probably coming from fear of family conflict and not because she doesn’t see your struggles.
However, she needs to understand her responsibility. Gently but firmly, you need to explain to her that avoiding this conversation is also a decision, which places the entire burden on your shoulders. Remind her that she will be claiming what is already hers.
Expecting people to understand your expectation will not bring justice in this and many other inheritance matters. You have to speak up. A family that wants to give you your right will do so without reminders. Families that want to delay will pretend that your silence is consent.
A respectful but direct approach, ideally from your wife, is necessary. It doesn’t need to be emotional. Just make it factual: what needs to be divided and is still pending.
You are a gazetted officer, a father of three and under financial strain. You should not simply accept the injustice quietly for the sake of family peace. If that peace is bankrupting one side while making others rich, it is simply convenience.
If talking to your brothers-in-law fails, seek legal counsel. Just knowing the legal position will empower your wife to speak with confidence rather than fear.
Talk frankly with your wife. Tell her that this is important for your children’s future, and remind her that asking for what is her right is not begging.
I hope the issue is resolved without bitterness. And I hope your wife finds the courage to claim what was always hers.
Disclaimer: If you or someone you know is in crisis and/or feeling suicidal, please go to your nearest emergency room and seek medical help immediately.
Auntie will not reply privately to any query. Please send concise queries to: auntieagni@gmail.com
