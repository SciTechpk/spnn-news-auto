The agency registered an FIR against Shah on December 29, 2025, under Section 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person) and Section 24 (cyberstalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act, 2025.
Shah has done extensive coverage of Karachi’s water issues.
In the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Tabish Raza Husnain, the complainant, alleged that Shah was “doing defamation propaganda against me and my senior Col. Anjum in different Facebook WhatsApp groups and make false and baseless allegations on me”.
He also alleged that Shah used “abusive language which caused me significant distress and damage to my reputation”.
In the FIR, the NCCIA said that the complainant had submitted screenshots of the alleged content.
It further noted that during the inquiry, the agency issued multiple notices to the accused, “directing him to appear before it to record his statement and clarify his position”.
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under the controversial Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.
Last year, Farhan Mallick, the founder of the media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested on March 20 in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code. The following day, he was handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) custody for four days.</p><small>2026-01-07 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07163246b93a8d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.
India forced Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, prompting anger in Dhaka.
With ties tense between the two countries, Bangladesh wants the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.
The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.
Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told AFP today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.

 

A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.
The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.
The ICC has not commented.
Bangladesh international Mustafizur was snapped up at the IPL auction in December by the Kolkata Knight Riders for more than $1 million.
But he was let go on the Indian cricket board’s “advice” after what it called “recent developments”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.

 

India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/071215403da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965621/social-media-posts-case-imaan-hadi-file-application-seeking-to-summon-dg-ispr-as-a-witness' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Imaan, Hadi file application seeking to summon DG ISPR as a witness</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, submitted an application in an Islamabad court on Wednesday seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in a case registered against them over their social media posts.
In the case, registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca), Mazari and Chattha have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
On Wednesday, the two submitted a written application to Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka during the hearing of the case, referring to a press conference addressed by the military spokesperson on January 6.
The application said the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. During the press conference, “references were made to matters directly pending trial before this learned court”.
“This is the exact prosecution case that is pending adjudication before this learned court,” the application said.
Mazari and Chattha contended that their request was a “clear requisite of natural justice in line with the Constitutional protection safeguarded for the accused persons with respect to the right to fair trial and due process”.
The court subsequently directed that a copy of the application be provided to the prosecution and said a decision on the request would be made after it heard the prosecution.
Later, the court said it was issue a decision on the application after the statements of the accused were recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
During the proceedings, prosecution witness Shahroz Riaz was also cross-examined. He made several admissions regarding the manner in which the inquiry in the case was initiated and the collection of social media content.
The hearing has been adjourned till January 8.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-07 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0714363003c4ebd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965630/special-protection-unit-being-set-up-in-islamabad-for-security-of-chinese-nationals-says-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Special protection unit being set up in Islamabad for security of Chinese nationals, says Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals.
According to a press release issued by the interior ministry, Naqvi made the remarks as he met China’s Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong in Beijing.
The two met at the headquarters of China’s Ministry of Public Security, where Naqvi received a warm welcome, the interior ministry said.
During the meeting, the leaders agreed to develop a joint and rapid response system against terrorism, including expanding training programs aimed at enhancing police capacity, it added.
Xiaohong lauded Pakistan’s efforts in countering terrorism and strengthening internal security, the statement said.
“We appreciate Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying.







During the meeting, “both ministers agreed on a joint strategy for training and enhancing the professional skills of police and security personnel”. They also vowed to maintain “an exchange of information between the police and other institutions of the two countries”.
Naqvi apprised the Chinese minister of the measures being taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, at which the latter expressed his satisfaction.
“The protection of Chinese citizens and projects of mutual interest remains our top priority,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He further said that “effective measures had been taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan”. He said that “a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals“.
Chinese citizens have come under attack multiple times in Pakistan, and according to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then.
The information was shared around a month after a security guard shot at two Chinese nationals in Karachi, leaving both of them injured.
In October that year, a bombing at the Karachi airport killed two Chinese engineers and left several others injured.
In July last year, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif said the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security.
He made the statement while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan, further highlighting that “the confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future”.
The PM also said that in light of the development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
Cooperation on prevention of cybercrime
The pair also discussed cooperation in the prevention of cybercrimes.
“Pakistan wants to benefit from the support of Chinese institutions to enhance the capacity of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA),“ the statement quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that Chinese-based AI technologies could be of “great help in countering terrorism and addressing security challenges”.
He said that Pakistan and China shared a bond based on “sustainable cooperation“. Naqvi expressed the desire to expand this cooperation further to tackle security challenges and protect mutual interests, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that the two sides will hold meetings of a joint working group every three months, while a meeting at a ministerial level will be held once a year.
Naqvi extended an invitation to the Chinese minister to visit Pakistan, and conveyed his best wishes to the Chinese president and prime minister on behalf of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Xiaohong also invited Naqvi to attend the Global Security Cooperation Forum — to be held in China in September, the statement added.
The Chinese minister expressed willingness to cooperate with Pakistan at all levels, stressing that “Pakistan and China are strategic partners”.
He also hosted a luncheon in honour of Naqvi and his delegation, the interior ministry said.</p><small>2026-01-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07073050f97daae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965589/government-mulls-fuel-levy-hike-to-aid-gas-sector' target='_blank'><strong>Government mulls fuel levy hike to aid gas sector</strong></a><br><p>• Minister confirms gas circular debt over Rs3 trillion, says no increase in tariff for six months• Ali Pervaiz Malik deflects questions by NA panel about proposed use of petroleum levy for gas sector
ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared to petrol and diesel which are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra had determined up to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan had concluded successful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.

 

Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

NEW DELHI: Although the government of Narendra Modi has persistently denied that the US played any role in mediating an end to the four-day India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam incident, a report in The Hindu details how a lobbying firm engaged by New Delhi made hectic calls to approach US officials on May 10, and beyond.
Although a filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) — including 60 entries made in December 2025 — did not divulge whether the calls on May 10 were made before or after the ceasefire, “they indicate close interaction on the day”, The Hindu wrote.
It said the embassy approached White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Ricky Gill at the National Security Council to discuss “media coverage” of the conflict.
This seems to contradict New Delhi’s stance, which has repeatedly denied several claims by US President Donald Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to award Mr Gill for the role he played in defusing the crisis.
In particular, the External Affairs Ministry consistently denied Trump’s contention he had threatened to stop trade if the conflict was not ended, and the call made to Mr Greer to discuss Operation Sindoor is particularly significant, the paper said.
The filings by US lobby firm SHW LLC raised eyebrows amongst diplomats in New Delhi as the firm also claimed that it set up meetings for several Indian officials — from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Deputy National Security Advisor Pavan Kapoor, and even Indian Ambassador Vinay Kwatra — with top Trump administration officials over the past year.
SHW LLC was contracted by the Indian Embassy on April 24, 2025. Dawn had previously reported on May 2 that former Trump aide Jason Miller’s firm had been engaged by New Delhi as a registered foreign agent for $150,000 per month.
It had no other clients over the year, according to the six FARA filings it made, and has been paid $900,000 in two quarterly instalments as part of an annual contract for $1.8 million.
The practice is a first, say former and current Indian officials, and indicates that rather than normal bilateral channels, the engagements — broadly over India-US trade ties and Operation Sindoor — were set up by the firm, led by former Trump spokesperson Miller, who is listed as the principal of SHW LLC.
While the embassy has always contracted two to three lobbyists at a time, to consult them on working with the Democrat and Republican parties, this is the first time a lobby firm has been asked to set up meetings with US officials, as also to schedule calls with government officials.
“Such meetings are routinely sought by the mission directly,” at least two Indian government officials told The Hindu.
“This seems to indicate that the Trump administration has set new rules of engagement and the government has been left with little choice but to play along,” a former diplomat, who had served at the Indian embassy previously, said.
“The Indian Embassy has hired such firms, consistent with local practice and requirements, under successive governments since the 1950s,” a spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said.
About the lobbying firm, The Hindu quoted another official as saying that lobbyists are hired “for advice and to understand the landscape, giving advice, and opening some doors,” but that meetings and calls are made between diplomats directly.
Apart from the calls on May 10, 2025, the firm billed the Embassy for making requests for the Parli­ame­ntary delegation led by Oppo­sition leader Shashi Tharoor to meet US Vice-President J.D. Vance and others.
On June 23, 2025, days before Mr. Jaishankar’s visit to Washington to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting, SHW says that it sent emails requesting meetings for the Minister with Mr. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA chief John Ratcliffe.
Of 60 entries detailing requests from the Indian Embassy, 30 reco­rded by SHW were requests for telephone calls to trade officials and White House senior officials to “discuss [the] status of US-India trade conversations”.
The calls increased in frequency as relations nosedived over US decisions to impose 25pc reciprocal tariffs and another 25pc in penalty tariffs for India’s oil procurement.
As tensions abated after Trump and Modi exchanged cordial words over social media, SHW said it made calls to White House officials to “flag social media post by Prime Minister Modi”.
Trump subsequently called Modi for his birthday on September 17, 2025, and the two leaders have spoken several times since then.

Speaking to reporters in Sukkur, Lanjar said a meeting was held wherein it was decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”.
“We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits that you see on social media,” he added.
Asked when the operation against the riverine dacoits was expected to begin, the minister replied, “You may consider that the operation has begun from today”.
Lanjar said dacoits would be “given a chance” to surrender before the courts. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them, there will be a fight, and they will get their just deserts,” he warned.
As per the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in Katcha Area of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, approved by the Sindh cabinet in October 2025, surrendering does not mean pardon or immunity.

 

All surrendering individuals shall face the prevailing law of the land, officials told Dawn, though voluntary surrender may be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing by courts.
The Sindh home minister appreciated the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation wherein a no-go Katcha area was vacated.
Responding to a question about whether the army’s help will be sought, Lanjar said, “The Sindh police is capable and the Rangers are with us in this, so I do not think we will need the army in our internal matters here.“
The minister further asserted that the required modern equipment will be provided to the personnel.
When a reporter mentioned that the dacoits employed drones, Lanjar said, “I do not think drones have reached them. Action is definitely being taken against their facilitators, too.”
On the possibility of a joint operation carried out by the Sindh and Punjab police, Lanjar said he has directed the Sindh inspector general to speak with his Punjab counterpart and the Bahawalpur regional police officer regarding the matter.

 

“This will surely happen only after a joint effort,” he stressed, noting that the area of Machka extends into Punjab. “I have strong hopes that we will wipe out these dacoits,” Lanjar said.
Asked about tribal disputes, the Sindh minister said this matter was also discussed in today’s meeting, and they had made the relevant contacts regarding the Jatoi-Mahar clash as well.
Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts.
On December 16, around 25 dacoits had attacked a bus near the Sindh-Punjab border and kidnapped 20 passengers after injuring the driver. The police recovered all the travellers unharmed the next day in a large operation.
When the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped at least 10 people from multiple vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5, 2025, it marked the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing M5 within Punjab’s limits.
As a safety measure, the police in Rahim Yar Khan later started running escorted night convoys on M-5 to protect motorists from dacoit gangs.
The Sindh and Punjab governments had vowed decisive action against the Katcha outlaws in August 2024, after a dozen policemen were martyred in a deadly attack by dacoits in the Machka area.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07132804e3c9081.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965625/contradiction-in-democracy-raza-rabbani-urges-na-speaker-senate-chairman-to-appoint-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>‘Contradiction in democracy’: Raza Rabbani urges NA speaker, Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani has called on the National Assembly (NA) speaker and Senate chairman to appoint opposition leaders in both houses of Parliament, saying that leaving the posts vacant “sidelines dissent”.
The posts have been lying vacant since August last year, when then-opposition leaders in the NA and Senate — PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz — were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan following their conviction in cases related to riots on May 9, 2023.
The PTI has nominated Pakhtun­khwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader for the NA and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the Senate slot, but their notification remains pending.
Rabbani pointed out in a statement on Monday that “Parliament is incomplete”, adding that “this exposes a contradiction in our democracy”.
“We talk of the supremacy of Parliament, yet less inclined to uphold this principle,” he added.
Saying that the “political system is already strained by polarisation”, he said the NA speaker and Senate chairperson should, under the rules, appoint leaders of the opposition, “as leaving the offices vacant sidelines dissent”.
“Such steps go towards weakening Parliament, a self-made disaster in a hybrid democracy,” he asserted.
As far as the appointment of the opposition leader in the NA is concerned, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said on Monday that the process would be initiated afresh.
He said this during a meeting with PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, who called on him to discuss the unusual delay in the opposition leader’s appointment.
Sadiq told Dogar that the rules on the matter were clear.
For his part, Dogar presented documents confirming the withdrawal of cases involving former Ayub from the courts.
He also reiterated demand for Achakzai to be appointed as the opposition leader.
In response, Sadiq emphasised that all proceedings would be conducted strictly in accordance with rules, laws, and the Constitution. He said he would inform the House about this matter in the upcoming session of the National Assembly.
The development came around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub. The letter said the provision of details in writing was necessary for completing the process for appointing an opposition leader in the lower house of parliament.
Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC), but withdrew his plea in October last year, and the election on the seat that fell vacant due to his disqualification was also held and won by a PML-N candidate.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained that the matter related to appointment of a new opposition leader was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat had stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Dogar, the NA Speaker confirmed the receipt of documents pertaining to Ayub’s cases. Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of the decision.
“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said. He added the process would move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0713043132ecb2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965624/hospital-sources-say-4-killed-in-airstrikes-on-yemen-separatist-leader-flees' target='_blank'><strong>Hospital sources say 4 killed in airstrikes on Yemen; separatist leader flees</strong></a><br><p>At least four civilians were killed in Saudi-led coalition strikes in Yemen on Wednesday, two hospital sources told AFP, as the force raided the home province of a separatist leader.
Yemen’s coalition attacked the home province of a UAE-backed separatist leader on Wednesday after he was kicked out of the presidency and accused of “high treason” for attempting to secede.
More than 15 airstrikes hit Dhale, the home governorate of Aidaros Alzubidi, whose Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month before seeing the advance rolled back by the coalition and pro-Saudi forces.
“The initial toll from the strikes on the province of al-Dhale is four civilian deaths and six wounded,” medical sources at the Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP.
Alzubidi fled and mobilised “large forces” in Yemen’s southwest, around Aden, after failing to attend talks in Riyadh, the coalition said.
Alzubidi “fled to an unknown location … after he had distributed weapons and ammunition to dozens of elements inside Aden”, coalition spokesperson Major General Turki al-Maliki said in a statement.
The coalition carried out new strikes to prevent Alzubidi from “escalating the conflict” and extending it into Dhale governorate, he said.
Alzubidi had been due to travel to the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Tuesday for talks aimed at easing the clashes.
But his plane was delayed and he was not on board when it departed, the coalition said.
A STC official told AFP that Alzubidi decided not to fly to Saudi Arabia after receiving information that he would be asked to dissolve the group, which forms part of the Presidential Leadership Council.
The official said the delegation left for Riyadh without Alzubidi.

 

A later statement from the STC said they had lost contact with the delegation that travelled to Riyadh for talks, and demanded Saudi authorities “guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh”.
STC spokesman Anwar Al-Tamimi told AFP that contact had been lost with the delegation that travelled to Riyadh during the night.
In a statement, the Presidential Leadership Council, which holds executive power and groups rival factions, announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of high treason.
“It has been established that [Alzubidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,” it said.
More than 100 people have been killed in the airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition on the newly seized separatist positions in the southern governorates.</p><small>2026-01-07 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0712161903ed28e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965620/pti-pushes-back-against-criticism-of-party-leadership-policies' target='_blank'><strong>PTI pushes back against criticism of party leadership, policies</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”.
In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference.
It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism.
The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”.







The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities.
It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”.
It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI.
“This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families.
The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”.
The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions.
The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”.
“Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said.
It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”.
“The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said.
It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”.
“There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”.
“History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security.
“Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said.
KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI.
He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”.







“The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”.
“Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said.
He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”.
CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”.
“In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said.
He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace.
“If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked.
“Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added.
He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”.
“It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said.
The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”.
“Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said.
He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed.
“It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added.
The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.</p><small>2026-01-07 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051118578fce5a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964293/how-ibne-safi-taught-an-entire-generation-to-read' target='_blank'><strong>How Ibne Safi taught an entire generation to read</strong></a><br><p>Karachi in the 1950s was not only a city under construction; it was a city learning how to read.
The years following Partition brought millions of migrants, anxieties and uncertainties to the port city. Together, they produced something: a wide public hungry for entertainment — gripping stories and dramatic narratives that could momentarily release readers from the grind of everyday survival.
Thus came about cheap print, serialised fiction, and an expanding entertainment economy, which created larger-than-life worlds for people struggling through daily precarity. It was in this environment that Asrar Ahmad — better known as Ibne Safi — emerged as one of the most widely read writers in the Urdu language.



His popularity is often described as a matter of talent alone. Certainly, he was a gifted stylist and storyteller. But literary brilliance does not, by itself, create a readership measured in the millions. Ibne Safi’s success partially rested on a deeper foundation: a whole publishing world that stretched back to colonial North India, reshaped in post-Partition Karachi, and oriented toward cultivating habits of regular reading, lawful conduct, and modern citizenship — ideals closely aligned with the nation’s aspirations at the time.
Seen this way, Ibne Safi was not merely writing spy stories; he was participating in the construction of a cultural market, and more importantly, a moral and civic imagination.
Building readers, not just writing books
One of the clearest signs that Ibne Safi wasn’t just spinning yarns comes from his paish lafz (prefaces). Addressing readers directly, he reassured newcomers that each novel in Jasusi Duniya was “complete” in itself, so that “new readers can start from any number without difficulty”. At the same time, he urged regular readers to place advance orders through local agents, warning that waiting until publication day might mean missing out altogether.
This was not an incidental authorial chatter, but rather a market discipline. By emphasising advance orders and serial continuity, Ibne Safi helped cultivate what economists would later call “repeat demand”. Readers learned to anticipate release dates, plan purchases, and treat fiction as a regular part of monthly life rather than an occasional indulgence.



These practices did not originate in Karachi. As literary historian Francesca Orsini argues, commercial Urdu publishing had already taken shape in late-colonial North India, where detective and mystery novels functioned as a full-fledged industry, complete with distribution networks, advertising strategies, and readers trained to expect regular instalments.
What Karachi inherited, then, was not simply a genre but a set of practices for producing readers on a large scale. What changed after Partition was the setting in which those practices now operated.
The city as mystery
With a mass readership, the question was no longer just about selling books, but about what those books helped people see. Here, spy fiction drew on a much older literary move in Urdu popular writing: the transformation of everyday urban life into a spectacle.
Writing about the late nineteenth century, literary scholar C. M. Naim traces how mistriz (mystery) and asrār (secret) novels began attaching suspense to recognisable places — Mistriz of Rawalpindi, Mistriz of Peshawar, Mistriz of Multan — so that readers could experience the thrill of danger not in some distant fantasy world, but in streets and cities that sounded real. That place-binding move, Naim suggests, produced what he calls a distinctly “sensational” atmosphere, where the everyday could be re-read as intrigue and risk rather than routine.
Francesca Orsini takes it a step further. She argues that this kind of storytelling wasn’t just about books — it was part of a bigger entertainment wave. Theatre, music, cinema — everything was about spectacle, suspense, and novelty. Audiences were being trained to seek spectacle, suspense, and novelty as part of modern city life. In other words, “sensational” reading was not just a literary taste; it was a social habit cultivated across multiple leisure industries.

 

Fast forward to Karachi of the 1950s, when those habits found a new metropolis, a new marketplace big enough to scale them. Pakistan’s film industry expanded rapidly — Urdu films released each year rose from five in 1949 to around 40 by 1960, per the Pakistan Film Magazine. Karachi’s entertainment economy was thriving, not only through cinema halls but also through the commercial ecosystems surrounding them.
It is telling, for instance, that Ibne Safi’s early publications were sent for sale to Regal Bookstore near Regal Cinema, linking the act of buying a spy novel to the city’s most visible engine of mass spectacle. Even the material form of these books moved in the same direction: publishers increasingly adopted colored cover designs. Ibne Safi’s covers became famous for their provocative, highly “sensational” imagery, featuring mysterious scenes, violent crimes, and often Western-looking femme-fatale figures that promised danger before a reader even turned the first page.



Seen this way, Ibne Safi’s fiction was not simply escapist reading that coincidentally became popular alongside films; it was part of a larger cultural production process — one that turned everyday experiences into commodities and trained readers to see the city as a legible field of secrets. His novels reimagined streets, offices, hotels, and clubs as places where plots could be hiding in plain sight. Karachi itself became a readable mystery.
And maybe that’s why these stories felt so comforting back then. Karachi was growing fast — it was chaotic, unfamiliar, a little unstable. But in Safi’s world, no matter how messy things got, someone could always figure it out. The answer was never magic — it was logic. Investigation, clues, and a sharp mind could bring order. The thrill wasn’t just the danger — it was the idea that even in the chaos of modern life, things could still make sense.
Language, legality, and literacy
In Pakistan’s nascent years, this was no small ambition. Independence coincided with the rapid expansion of centralised state power. Yet, legality itself remained fragile. Emergency powers, crimes, and coups meant that the law was present as an ideal and absent in practice.
It was precisely in this gap between law as promise and law as practice that detective fiction found its audience. Millions of readers encountered ideas about legality, evidence, and accountability not through courts or textbooks, but through popular novels sold at bookstalls and circulated through libraries. Spy fiction offered what might be called a vernacular legal education: it normalised investigation over vengeance, procedure over impulse, and reason over rumour. However spectacular the crime, Ibne Safi’s stories insisted on one thing: justice must be explained.
Critics have long noted this pattern. For example, literary scholar Christina Oesterheld argues that even when Ibne Safi wrote about state-level corruption, international crime syndicates, or criminalised institutions, his stories invariably resolved through logic rather than miracle. Disorder was never left mysterious. The pleasure lay not only in suspense, but in seeing chaos rendered intelligible.
Safi wasn’t shy about pushing proper Urdu either. He took the language seriously, sometimes almost too seriously. In one didactic piece, he joked that “those who did not know Urdu grammar were effectively blind, deaf, and crippled”. Hyperbole aside, the point aligned neatly with official thinking of the period.

 

From the 1950s onward, Pakistani policymakers — often working with international organisations — treated literacy not merely as a cultural good, but as a developmental necessity. “New literates” were expected to acquire not just reading skills, but disciplined habits: regular reading, library use, and linguistic standardisation.
Unesco reports from Karachi made this goal explicit. The challenge, they argued, was not teaching people to read once, but producing attractive material that would sustain reading over time. Cheap, serial, and engaging, popular fiction was perfectly suited to that task. It cultivated reading as a routine rather than an obligation.
Whether or not he meant to, Safi’s novels were doing quiet, meaningful developmental work. By making legality intelligible and reading habitual, his fiction reinforced the period’s development ethos.
A rupee well spent
Safi knew what he was doing — and he was proud of it. He often bragged that almost every Urdu reader in both Pakistan and India knew Jasusi Duniya, and that “in today’s world, there is no other language offering such interesting literature at such a low price”. For him, literary achievement rested on three things at once: reach, quality, and accessibility.
That claim was not mere self-promotion. It reflected the material realities of Karachi’s publishing market in the 1950s. Evidence from Pakistan’s National Bibliography shows that most books published by major houses during the first decade after independence were expensive — often priced well above one rupee.
In a city flooded with refugees struggling to secure housing and basic necessities, such books were luxuries. But Ibne Safi’s novels were consistently priced at around Rs1, even as page counts increased. In a market where price alone could determine whether a book was read or ignored, this difference mattered.

 

The structure of the industry helps explain why. A government report from the 1960s noted that Pakistan’s publishing sector remained small due to low literacy and weak purchasing power. To survive, publishers typically priced books at nearly three times their production cost, relying on high margins rather than high volume. Unsurprisingly, many gravitated toward textbook publishing, where demand was guaranteed by schools and state curricula. By 1960, roughly four-fifths of publishers and booksellers were involved in textbooks.
Ibne Safi, however, operated differently. As both author and publisher, he was not competing head-to-head with major literary houses, nor was he dependent on institutional buyers. His business model rested on scale: large readerships, quick turnover, and modest margins. Booksellers often marked up his novels precisely because demand was so strong. Affordability was not a by-product of popularity — it was a precondition for it.
The pattern becomes even clearer when looking across the broader market. Data on nearly two thousand literary titles published in West Pakistan between 1947 and 1961 reveal two consistent tendencies: first, books written in Urdu were significantly cheaper than books in other languages, and second, fiction was cheaper than non-fiction. That sweet spot — Urdu fiction — was where affordability and entertainment met. It’s no wonder it took off the way it did.
This pricing structure was not accidental. Urdu was being promoted as the national language for political and administrative efficiency, while popular culture — films, chapbooks, serialised novels — was increasingly organised around sensation and entertainment. Fiction benefited from both trends. It could be printed cheaply, sold widely, and circulated rapidly.
Affordability also depended on where and how books moved. Karachi’s publishing economy expanded rapidly during the 1950s, with capital and businesses concentrating in the city centre alongside cinemas, schools, and transport hubs. Yet official statistics tell only part of the story. A vast amount of reading material circulated through informal channels: chapbooks, pirated editions, and so-called “bazaar literature” that rarely appeared in state records. Unesco reports from the period acknowledged that these networks served as powerful mass distribution systems, drawing on older cultural traditions and dense personal ties.
Ibne Safi’s novels thrived in this environment. Their popularity spread beyond formal bookstores into informal markets, sometimes without royalties or authorisation. This counterfeit impulse undoubtedly hurt the author financially, but it also expanded his readership. Stories travelled faster than contracts. For many readers, especially those at the margins of the formal economy, these cheaper or copied editions were the only way to participate in the new reading culture.
Taken together, affordability and accessibility made his novels a social force, which allowed reading to become habitual rather than occasional. Students, clerks, muhajirs — people who were building new lives in a new city — found something familiar and exciting in those pages. A one-rupee book didn’t just pass the time; it created a shared experience and brought people into a common world of characters, clues, and conversation.
The making of the world of espionage
But beyond nostalgia, what does this tell us today?
First, it reminds us that a reading public is created. They require cheap formats, predictable circulation, and deliberate cultivation of habits. Ibne Safi did not simply respond to demand; he helped create it. Second, it shows that popular culture can perform civic work. Long before governance became a buzzword, detective fiction familiarised readers with law, evidence, and accountability. This did not fix institutions, but it shaped expectations about how authority ought to function.

 

Third, it highlights the political economy of language. Urdu’s centrality to Pakistan’s cultural life was reinforced not only by ideology, but by pricing, accessibility, and market scale. Finally, it poses an uncomfortable question for the present. As reading shifts from shared print cultures to fragmented digital feeds, what happens to the common habits that once anchored public life?
The Unesco language of “new literates” may sound dated, but the underlying concern remains urgent: if reading becomes a luxury, civic imagination shrinks.
Ibne Safi’s spies lived in the streets of Karachi because his readers did too. His stories offered a way to navigate modernity — its dangers, its rules, its promises — at a price ordinary people could afford.</p><small>2026-01-07 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0711195069f02c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965618/5-killed-24-others-injured-as-bus-plunges-into-ravine-near-talagang' target='_blank'><strong>5 killed, 24 others injured as bus plunges into ravine near Talagang</strong></a><br><p>CHAKWAL: Five people were killed while 24 others were injured as a passenger bus carrying them fell into a ravine near Talagang, Rescue 1122 said on Wednesday.
According to rescue officials, the incident occurred at around 2:15am early on Wednesday.
Chakwal Rescue 1122 spokesperson Qazi Muhammad Akram said the passenger bus was on its way from Rawalpindi to Bahawalpur.
As the motorway was closed due to fog, the driver opted for an alternative route and used the Talagang-Fatehjang Road, he said.
When the bus was passing by Dhoke Pathan village located on the bank of the Sowaan River, the driver lost control on a winding patch of road, the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said.
As a result, the bus plunged into a 100-foot-deep ravine, he said. Five passengers, including the bus driver, died at the spot while 24 others sustained injuries, he said.
He said that Rescue 1122 officials rushed to the scene after the incident was reported. He added that 15 officials and five emergency vehicles took part in the rescue operation which lasted for more than two hours.
Four of the deceased were identified as 56-year-old Abdul Sattar, the driver of the vehicle; 40-year-old Zia Ahmed from Kotli Sattiyan; 33-year-old Mohammad Ishaq from Lodhran; and 45-year-old Ramzan from Multan. The body of the fifth person has not yet been identified..
“We have taken the dead bodies to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Talagang while all the injured were taken to City Hospital Talagang,” District Rescue Officer Dr Mohammad Atique told Dawn.
He added that all the injured passengers were being examined at the hospital.
Meanwhile, Talagang Assistant Commissioner Suleman Mansha and Deputy Superintendent of Police Malik Azi visited the injured at City Hospital.
AC Mansha directed the hospital management to leave no stone unturned in treating the injured.
The incident comes days after another accident in Punjab, when over 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road on December 31, 2025. The death toll rose in the following days as more victims succumbed to their injuries, reaching 17 on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, authorities have closed several key motorways over traffic safety concerns due to dense fog in the province. Punjab Rescue 1122 said stated on Monday that it had responded to 1,081 road traffic crashes in the province during the previous 24 hours. These incidents claimed 24 lives and left 1,251 people injured, it said.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07112738f2681fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965619/bethell-stands-tall-as-england-174-3-in-final-test-nine-behind' target='_blank'><strong>Bethell stands tall as England 174-3 in final Test, nine behind</strong></a><br><p>Rock-solid Jacob Bethell was 79 not out as England narrowed Australia’s lead to just nine runs by tea on day four of the fifth and final Ashes Test on Wednesday, but veteran Joe Root fell cheaply.
The tourists battled to 174-3 by the break at the Sydney Cricket Ground with Harry Brook on 24 alongside the 22-year-old, who is targeting a maiden century.
Australia were dismissed for 567 before lunch on the back of Travis Head’s 163 and 138 from skipper Steve Smith.
That left England chasing a 183-run deficit after their first innings 384, with a question mark over Ben Stokes’s ability to bat.
The England captain limped off clutching what appeared to be his groin while bowling the third over of the day and did not reappear.
Mitchell Starc removed Zak Crawley for one as England reached lunch at 80-1, then Ben Duckett (42) and first innings century-maker Root (6) departed during the second session.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another morale-boosting win after victory in the previous Test at Melbourne.
They needed a solid start to the chase, but chief tormentor Starc once again conjured up a first-over breakthrough – his 29th wicket for the series.
The pace spearhead delivered a beautiful inswinger that Crawley misjudged and left, with the ball smacking his pads and he was out lbw for one.
Duckett and Bethell survived until lunch, though Duckett lived dangerously, dropped on 38 by Cameron Green diving in front of Smith at first slip.
The Nottinghamshire opener failed to capitalise and was gone in the third over after the interval, chopping on Michael Neser for 42, his highest score in a wretched series.
Root, fresh from his first innings 160, was terrorised by Starc and Neser.
He finally fell lbw after 37 facing balls for his six runs to the relentless Scott Boland, with the 35-year-old trudging off dejected.
But Bethell proved unmovable and brought up a fourth Test half-century with a boundary from Starc as he looks to make the number three slot his own.







Australia resumed at 518-7, with Smith on 129 after his 13th Ashes century — more than any other player except the legendary Don Bradman — and Beau Webster on 42.
Smith flogged Stokes through the covers for a boundary in his first over, while Webster dished out similar treatment to Brydon Carse.
But the Australia skipper did not last long, nicking a fuller length delivery from Josh Tongue to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.
All-rounder Webster reached a fifth half-century in his eighth Test with a single and put on 20 with Starc before the big paceman was bowled by Tongue for five.
Scott Boland suffered a golden duck, edging Will Jacks to Harry Brook in the slips to leave Webster unbeaten on 71.
Tongue ended with 3-97 and Carse 3-130.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/070727365866baf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965604/trump-says-venezuela-turning-over-up-to-50m-barrels-of-oil-to-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Venezuela ‘turning over’ up to 50m barrels of oil to US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president.
The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.
Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.
The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend.
Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves.
Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post.







“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.

 

Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.
The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.
“Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said.
Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment.
Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US
US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US.
That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.
Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.
It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars.
Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion.
Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.
Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers
Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters.
Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.
This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said.
The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility.
Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’
US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela.
“Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News, when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports.
“With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.”
US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.
PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.
Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07102808fe06d64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965616/trump-discussing-how-to-acquire-greenland-us-military-always-an-option-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump discussing how to acquire Greenland, US military always an option: White House</strong></a><br><p>The White House said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the military, in a revival of his ambition to control the strategic island despite European objections.
Trump sees acquiring Greenland as a US national security priority necessary to “deter our adversaries in the Arctic region”, the White House said in a statement.
“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilising the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House said.
Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind the Arctic territory on Tuesday, saying it belongs to its people.

 

A US military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the Nato alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.
The strong opposition has not deterred Trump from reviewing how to make Greenland a US hub in an area where there is growing interest from Russia and China. Trump’s interest, initially voiced in 2019 during his first term in office, has been rekindled in recent days in the wake of the US arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Emboldened by Maduro’s capture last weekend, Trump has voiced his belief that American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again, and has put pressure on both Colombia and Cuba.
He has also started talking about Greenland again after putting it on the back burner for months.
A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Trump and his advisers are discussing a variety of ways to acquire Greenland.
Is Greenland for sale?
Those options include the outright US purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory, the official said. A COFA agreement would stop short of Trump’s ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the United States.
The official did not provide a potential purchase price.
“Diplomacy is always the presidents first option with anything, and dealmaking. He loves deals. So if a good deal can be struck to acquire Greenland, that would definitely be his first instinct,” the official said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that recent administration threats against Greenland did not signal an imminent invasion and that the goal is to buy the island from Denmark during a classified briefing late on Monday for congressional leaders, two sources familiar with the briefing said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Rubio’s comment.
Members of Congress, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, pushed back against the administration’s comments on Greenland, noting that Nato member Denmark has been a loyal US ally.
“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, the co-chairs of the Senate Nato Observer Group, said in a statement.
Administration officials say the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals important for high-tech and military applications. These resources remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and other challenges.
Its not going away, the official said about the president’s drive to acquire Greenland during his remaining three years in office.</p><small>2026-01-07 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0709202502baa22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965541/police-expand-scope-of-probe-into-suicide-bid-by-varsity-student-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Police expand scope of probe into suicide bid by varsity student in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police have expanded the scope of investigation into the case of a female student’s attempted suicide at a private university, following an earlier similar incident involving a male student.
The University of Lahore constituted a ‘high-level’ inquiry committee comprising senior faculty members and the management officers hours after a D. Pharmacy student attempted suicide by jumping from the second floor of the varsity building on Monday.
Fatima (21) was rushed to a local hospital with her both legs fractured badly and injuries to her other body parts. The police inquiries so far suggested that she took the extreme step following the pressure of her family to continue her studies in D. Pharmacy while she found it a tough subject. There were also reports that the student and her family had an heated argument on the same issue on Saturday last when she again raised the matter.
According to police officials, the student’s family has so far not submitted any application seeking legal action. Her statement could not be recorded due to the severity of her injuries.

Investigators record statements of family

Police said the student sustained serious injuries to her spine and lungs after jumping from the university building. All required medical tests have been repeated and investigators have also received information from her family.
Police have taken custody of CCTV footage from all cameras installed inside and around the university to establish the full sequence of events, which is currently being reviewed.
Police sources said action would be taken against the university administration if any negligence or lapse is established during the investigation.
Investigators said the student remained on a phone call for 27 minutes before jumping and had deleted the record of her last call.
Initial findings suggested that she arrived at the university in the morning but did not attend her class. She was reportedly upset after receiving 18 marks out of 35 in a test, a matter she had also discussed with her father and brother.
Police said further progress in the case would be made after recording the student’s statement.
Meanwhile, the injured student remains under treatment at Lahore General Hospital (LGH). The hospital administration confirmed that she has suffered a head injury and fractures to her back and knee.

 

On Tuesday, Higher Education Department (HED) Secretary Ghulam Farid Kathia visited LGH and inquired after the student. Medical Superintendent Dr Faryad Hussain briefed him on her medical condition.
During a media briefing, Ameeruddin Medical College Principal Prof Farooq Afzal said the student’s condition has improved but the next 48 hours are critical.A special medical board, headed by Prof Jodat Saleem, has been formed comprising specialists from neurosurgery, surgery, orthopaedics, pulmonology and gynaecology.
Prof Jodat Saleem said the patient was in shock on arrival and had lost significant blood. Doctors administered two units of blood and successfully stabilised her condition.
He said the patient’s response to treatment has improved and medical care is continuing.

However, after submitting written assurances of compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) to the district administration, shopkeepers are hoping their businesses will reopen soon.
Akbar Road, commonly known as Akbar Market, is one of the largest hubs for buying and selling motorcycles in the metropolis. On a normal day, the road remains jam-packed due to motorcycles being displayed by shopkeepers along both sides of the road and footpaths, making it difficult for commuters and residents of adjacent areas to move freely.
Residents of the adjacent locality said that every year, during anti-encroachment drives, the district administration seizes motorcycles and stalls set up on roads and footpaths, after which traffic can move freely. However, they added that this situation rarely lasts even a week, as encroachments soon reappear.

Shopkeepers say they have paid Rs5,000 each in fines, file affidavits pledging compliance with SOPs

During a visit to the market on Tuesday, Dawn observed that the scene was markedly different; shops on both sides of the road were sealed, and employees and shop owners were seen sitting outside their closed shops, waiting to reopen after submitting affidavits to the district commissioner’s office, South.
‘Significant financial losses’
Karachi Motorcycle Dealer Association Chairman Muhammad Ahsan Gujjar told Dawn that on Jan 3, the district administration had sealed at least 95 shops over encroachment as they were displaying bikes on the road and footpath.
He added that he had spoken to the assistant commissioner South, who assured him that after submitting affidavits pledging not to violate SOPs in the future, the shops would be reopened and de-sealed soon.
Referring to the losses being suffered by traders due to the sealing of shops, Mr Gujjar said that daily between 1,500 and 2,000 new motorcycles are sold in the market. He added that this activity used to generate millions of rupees for the government in the form of sales tax, registration fees and transfer fees.
“Today is the fourth day since the shops were sealed, and an estimated loss of millions of rupees is being incurred,” he claimed.
While responding to a query on whether the district administration had informed shopkeepers in advance about the encroachment drive, the market association president, Aqeel Sheikh, said that shopkeepers had been informed earlier, and motorcycles were removed from the roads. However, he claimed that the Jan 3 operation was carried out without prior notice from the authorities.
He alleged that car denters and painters blocked the streets surrounding the Preedy police station, while pickups at Regal Chowk were also obstructing traffic, yet no action was being taken against them.
He added that Akbar Road is a major market where traders, who are taxpayers, generate millions of rupees in revenue, but it was they who were being “subjected to injustice”.
A traffic police official at the Preedy police station said that a single-lane parking is allowed and that vehicles parked in no-parking zones or double lanes are fined.
Responding to a question about whether the display of motorcycles blocking Akbar Road constituted a traffic violation, the officer said that shopkeepers usually park bikes for display on footpaths and roads as well, which falls under the jurisdiction of the anti-encroachment department.
However, he added that if the authorities do not take action and traffic flow is affected, the traffic police intervene, particularly in cases of double-lane parking.
This correspondent witnessed business as usual in the adjacent streets of Akbar Road as workshops, mechanics and spare parts shops for bikes remained open.
Meanwhile, another old market situated on Magazine Lane in the Saddar area, where used auto parts are sold, remained shut for the second day.
One shopkeeper claimed that the authorities sealed shops without considering whether they were involved in encroachments or not, adding that shopkeepers had already submitted affidavits to the authorities.
However, following the anti-encroachment drive, it has been observed that shops which were not sealed in the electronics market near Regal Chowk, auto parts market and adjacent streets of Akbar Road — which come within the remit of the Saddar area — are complying with SOPs, and footpaths are now free of encroachments.
On Tuesday evening, a market official said that all shopkeepers had paid Rs5,000 each in fines and that business activities would resume from Wednesday (today).
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso also confirmed this and said that the sealed shops would open on Wednesday.

In a video posted by Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X, Imran’s sister Aleema said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had informed them that a meeting would be arranged next week.
Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party.
“This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday.







“Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said.
Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water.
In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters.
However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week.
“Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration.







She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir.







For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws.
He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting.







He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest.
“If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said.
“If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said.







On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site.
The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order.
The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum.
It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.</p><small>2026-01-07 03:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07080546e656e71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965524/ctd-gets-custody-of-bla-men-in-explosives-case' target='_blank'><strong>CTD gets custody of ‘BLA men’ in  explosives case</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) has remanded three suspected terrorists, said to be associated with the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in the custody of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a case pertaining to the possession of around 2,000 kilograms of explosives.
The CTD had brought the three suspects before the administrative judge of the ATCs, at the Judicial Complex within the premises of Karachi central prison and sought their physical custody for further interrogation.
The court remanded the trio in CTD custody until Jan 24 and directed the investigating officer (IO) to produce them on the next date along with a progress report.
According to the CTD, acting on a tip-off, law enforcers apprehended suspect Jalil alias Fareed in Rais Goth. Later, suspects Hamdan Qadir Buksh and Niaz Ali Muhammad were also arrested.
It claimed to have recovered 2,000 kilograms of explosives, 30 plastic drums and five cylinders, rigged with various detonators, and a truck. The police said they were planing to carry out a terrorist attack in the city. During initial grilling, Jalil disclosed that he had been allegedly affiliated with the proscribed Majeed Brigade of the BLA.
Regarding the truck, the suspect revealed that it was intended to be used at a targeted location in Karachi for a terrorist act.
The CTD had registered a case for the offences under Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act read with Sections 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. On Monday,CTD officials told a press conference that the suspects had obtained the explosive material from Afghanistan.

The case was heard by Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Amjad Ali Shah. During the proceedings, defence lawyers sought the court’s permission to meet Mr Khan at Adiala Jail, stating that access was necessary to obtain instructions regarding the pending cases.
Defence counsel told the court that they had alre­ady taken instructions from the PTI founder in connection with the cases, reiterating that effective legal represen­tation requi­red direct consultation with their client.
Opposing the request, the special prosecutor submitted that Mr Khan was on bail in the May 9 GHQ attack case and was not in the custody of the ATC. He further informed the court that the PTI founder had since been convicted in ano­t­h­er case, adding that the defence could appro­ach the relevant forum if it had any grievance regarding access.
The prosecutor mainta­ined that, as a convicted pri­s­oner, the PTI founder was in the custody of the jail sup­e­r­intendent and that, under the law, jail aut­hori­ties had the power to regulate meetings. He argued that the issue rai­s­ed by the defence did not fall within the jurisdiction of the ATC hearing the GHQ attack case.
In response, the defence counsel adopted a firm position, stating that until they were granted access to the PTI founder, they would not be a part of the court proceedings. During the hearing, the court also took notice of the absence of several accused and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 40 to 45 accused who failed to appear.
Trial via video link
The court provided defence lawyers with a copy of the Punjab government’s notification regarding the conduct of the trial through a video link. According to the notification issued on October 30 last year, proceedings in the May 9 GHQ attack case are to be conducted via video link.

 

Later, the court adjourned the hearing until January 20.
Separately, the hearing of the Judicial Complex attack case against the PTI founder and other accused in the Anti-Terrorism Court, Islamabad, was adjourned without proceedings due to the unavailability of Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra. The court fixed the next date of hearing for February 6.
Similarly, the hearing of another case registered at the Secretariat Police Station was also adjourned without proceedings owing to the judge’s absence. As a result, statements of witnesses could not be recorded, and the next hearing was fixed for January 12.

QUETTA: The provincial government has formally merged the over century-old Levies Force into the Balochistan Police, and abolished all ‘B’ areas across the province, converting them into ‘A’ areas for the purpose of territorial jurisdiction of the provincial police.
The two areas defined the territorial jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies within the province. The Balochistan Police acted as the law enforcement agency in ‘A’ areas, while the Levies Force operated in ‘B’ areas, functioning under the command of division and district officials.
The process of merging the Balochistan Levies and ex-federal Levies into the police force had been under way for a long time and has now been completed, with the provincial government moving to enforce a uniform system of laws and regulations under a single command across the province.
The provincial government declared Sibi and Loralai divisions as ‘A-Areas’ for the territorial jurisdiction of the Balochistan Police, according to a notification issued by Additional Chief Secretary Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat on Monday evening.
It said all members of the Levies Force, both provincial and ex-federal, serving in the converted areas, as well as members of the CPEC Wing, were merged into the Balochistan Police in their existing nomenclature, ranks, pay scales and benefits, corresponding to those applicable to police personnel.
Furthermore, the services, administration and functioning of the merged Levies Force and the converted areas will henceforth be governed by the provisions of the Balochistan Police Act.
The notification said that in continuation of the decision, all budgetary allocations and finances, DDO codes, arms and ammunition, police stations, check-posts and pickets, vehicles, records and investigations, training institutions, and all ancillary and auxiliary infrastructure pertaining to the Levies Force in the converted areas would be transferred to the Balochistan Police with immediate effect.
It further stated that the superintendent of police of a converted district would, upon request, place police personnel at the disposal of the district administration and other government functionaries for assistance in the enforcement of local and special laws and for other lawful public duties.
The commissioners of Sibi and Loralai divisions have been directed to complete the transition process within 30 days of the issuance of the notification.
‘Ambiguity resolved’
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, in a post on X, said the “longstanding administrative ambiguity over the implementation of a uniform law in Balochistan has been officially resolved”.
“The division into A and B area categories has been abolished, and the Levies Force has been formally and legally merged into the Balochistan Police,” he said, adding that the decision would clarify state responsibilities and further strengthen the scope of public protection.







The matter also came up in the ISPR chief’s press conference on Tuesday. Talking about the move, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, “This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.”
In October last year, the Balochistan government merged the provincial and federal Levies forces with the police in six out of eight administrative divisions of the province, declaring these divisions as A-areas.
The six divisions included Quetta, Kalat, Makran, Zhob, Rakhshan and Nasirabad. However, the Levies Force in Sibi and Loralai divisions, which included Dera Bugti, Sibi, Kohlu, Harnai, Ziarat and other districts, were not merged into the Balochistan Police.
Professional responsibilities
The Balochistan Police have stepped up efforts to strengthen their training system and improve residential and welfare facilities to better prepare former Levies personnel, merged from ‘B’ areas to ‘A’ areas, for their professional responsibilities.
Officials said that enhancing the quality of policing was essential to restoring public trust and ensuring sustainable law and order in the province.
As part of the initiative, professionalism, transparency, accountability and the use of modern technology have been declared essential for effective policing. Significant improvements have been made to accommodation and basic facilities at the Police Training College (PTC), Quetta, to create a more conducive and efficient training environment for trainees from various districts of Balochistan.
At present, 772 former Levies personnel are availing training and residential facilities at PTC Quetta.
A comprehensive three-month training programme for personnel merged from ‘B’ areas to ‘A’ areas began on Jan 1 this year. The programme includes physical training, weapons handling, marksmanship and counterterrorism skills to enable trainees to respond effectively to security challenges.
Training is being conducted on modern lines, with special emphasis on improving investigative skills, legal awareness, intelligence-based policing and community participation.
PTC Commandant Shahzad Akbar said residential blocks had been equipped with modern facilities to provide safe and comfortable accommodation to personnel during training. He added that a modern futsal ground had been established to promote physical fitness and healthy activities, while the parade ground had been upgraded to meet training requirements and ensure safety during practical exercises.

According to a navy statement, PNS Behr Masah has been deployed in support of this scientific mission, which is being conducted by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in collaboration with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography.
According to NHO, the Behr Masah is a hydrographic survey ship with the capability to undertake oceanographic and geo-physical surveys. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the navy underscored its commitment to promoting maritime awareness and facilitate marine scientific research in Pakistan.

Exercise aimed at improving understanding of Pakistani marine environment

The Joint Oceanographic Cruise represents a significant scientific collaboration between Pakistan and China, aimed at enhanced understanding of the marine environment in Pakistani waters. 
The research outcomes are expected to increase awareness of coastal and offshore marine dynamics, enabling better assessment of environmental patterns and supporting informed maritime planning and policymaking.
According to the NIO, the signing ceremony of the ‘Letter of Agreement on China-Pakistan Joint Cruises for Marine Environment and Ecosystem in Pakistan Coastal Area’ was held in Hangzhou, China, on Dec 12, 2025.
The NIO initiated the joint marine cruises with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography for the collection of marine environmental and ecosystem data across all four seasons in Pakistan’s coastal areas.
This will be an opportunity for senior representatives of both institutions to collaborate on marine ecosystems, coastal dynamics, climate change, and the sustainable utilisation of ocean resources. It will be a shared commitment to scientific cooperation, data exchange, joint research initiatives and capacity building.
Through this initiative, Pakistani scientists will have the opportunity to analyse samples in Chinese laboratories, which is not possible in Pakistan due to the lack of expensive laboratory equipment and machines. Pakistani personnel will also have opportunities for training on ocean equipment innovation, equipment operation, data collection techniques on board, and post-cruise laboratory analysis.

Pakistan’s recent relations with both India and Afghanistan have been characterised by significant strain and tension. Pakistan fought a four-day war with India in May 2025 and had a border skirmish with the Afghan Taliban regime in October of the same year.
“Absolutely, we are ready, by the grace of God,“ said Asif on Geo News programme Capital Talk when asked if the country was prepared and capable of handling a war of aggression on its eastern and western borders.
Asif said the country and its armed forces had demonstrated proof of this preparedness during the May 2025 conflict with India.
“The way we gave them a crushing response is the strongest evidence that we were prepared and responded in time,” said the defence minister.
He maintained that the world witnessed how “Modi was thrashed” and how, following the conflict, he lost “all credibility both within his country and internationally”.
The minister further said that following the befitting response by the Pakistan armed forces, India “approached the US” for a ceasefire.
“You can determine from that how badly they were shattered — to the point that they had to call China.”
Pakistan‘s response, which came during the early morning hours of May 10, saw large-scale attacks with guided weapons and drones on Indian military targets. Airbases along the border, posts on the Line of Control (LoC) and India’s S-400 surface to missile systems were hit among other targets.
However, the defence minister expressed confidence that there would not be a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers when asked whether India could launch another attack, involve the Taliban, and then bring in US President Trump to enforce a ceasefire.
He further said that the four-day war with India enhanced Pakistan’s prestige. “Our armed forces’ strength is recognised by the entire world,“ said the defence minister, adding that recent orders for fighter aircraft show ”that our jets have been [battle] tested“.
The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. During the conflict, the Pakistan Air Force shot down at least six India fighter aircraft. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2026-01-06 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0614204031c9d90.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965440/dg-ispr-says-afghans-involved-in-major-terrorist-incidents-in-pakistan-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR says Afghans involved in major terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2025</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025.
At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year.



This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counter-terrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan,” he added.
The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion.
He maintained that the fight against terrorism concerned the entire nation and had been ongoing for more than two decades. The DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts.”

 


In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”.
“The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly Afghanistan becoming a “base for terrorist operations”.

 


Moreover, he added that the past year also demonstrated “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”.
In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation launched by the military in 2024 — was drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus on the necessity of implementing the NAP to eliminate terrorism.
He acknowledged, however, that “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of the NAP.
After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind declaring 2025 a “landmark and consequential year” in counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to discuss them in detail.


.A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6.

75,175 IBOs in 2025
Sharing data, the military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in 2025.
“Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Breaking it down, he noted that 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.
Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan, and 10 in other areas.
In 2025, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism.
Sharing data about suicide bombing incidents, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of these, 16 occurred in KP, 10 in Balochistan, and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex.
“Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.”
In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP.
“The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environment provided [to terrorists], and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing in the province,” he said.

 


The DG ISPR highlighted that data show terrorism began to rise in 2021. A total of 193 terrorists were killed that year compared to 592 law enforcement personnel who were martyred, a ratio of 1:3, he added.
Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed last year, while 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This translated to a ratio of 2:1, he added.
“But more importantly, what happened in 2021 that caused terrorism to rise?” he questioned, and he elaborated on the reasons behind this development.
The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement.
“An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and entered into an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled.
But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned.
“They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.”
“Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan has become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.”
Naming various terror outfits that he said were operating from Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said Afghanistan had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”.
He said that around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had recently reached Afghanistan from Syria.
The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation,” had started organising the TTP according to its organisational structure. The DG ISPR added that they also trained and directed the terror outfit.
Moreover, the Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan.
“On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth and religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.”
“But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.”
The DG ISPR also spoke about the war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion was pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
“When the [supply of] that money stopped, to continue running the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism across the entire region. They find new patrons and financial sponsors, with the biggest patron for terrorism in Pakistan being India,” he said.
The DG ISPR added that India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and providing them with financial and other assistance.
“So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].”
The military spokesperson added that the Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy.
The military spokesperson elaborated that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, high-powered sniper rifles, body armour and other personal protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 assault rifles — “the best of weapons and ammunition”.
This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”.
Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating terrorists” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan.”
This was seemingly a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP.
The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them terrorists so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a rise in terror incidents.”
By 2023, he added, that state began standing against them.
Lieutenant General Chaudhry referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines, Peshawar, in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now.”
Further elaborating on this “clarity,” he used strong language, saying that terrorists had no religious association; they had to be eliminated, and action had to be taken against them.
“But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, train yourself, adopt the right technology, build the narrative, and take the nation along.
“You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.”
The military spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised about the large number of terror incidents: 5,397 in 2025.
“Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are conducting 75,000 IBOs, 206 per day, and we are taking them on.“
“By ‘we,’ I mean myself, you, and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. There are a few things in life worth fighting for, where fighting is not only justified but necessary, and there is no alternative.”
He said that when terrorism has reared its head in other countries, it has destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies, and your army are fighting on a daily basis.”
Terrorism surge after May conflict
Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, terrorism surged. After its defeat, “Indians immediately sought to influence non-state actors.”
Afghanistan served as the base of operations for those incidents, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism.
“And then we carried out strikes on terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border in October, not targeting the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, which is acting as a proxy and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts, coming in direct support of the terrorists.“
“So the state of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours, and a hard message was sent.”
The DG ISPR said that posts were obliterated not just at the border but also inside Afghanistan.
He added that the border was closed after that, and terror incidents and the facilitation of terrorists declined.
“The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.”
He said parallels had been drawn between Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025.
“Those drawing the parallel are trying to spin a narrative,” he said.
He added, “In May 2025, India targeted Pakistani citizens; Pakistan, however, did not target Afghans in October.”
“We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there.
“We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not.
“Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?”
He again asserted that in the October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP.
The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge.
Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying.
They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said.
Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghans.”
The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them went back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you did not stand up against them, they would blow themselves up in your homes, markets, offices, schools, and streets until you adopt their perverted ideology.”
After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists,” he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP.
He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs,” including the people of Pakistan and personnel of the police, armed forces, and Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents.
Three main pillars of counter-terrorism
Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism.
Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground.
The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was offensive actions by small teams, and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.”
Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones.
But in fact, it was the terrorists who began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopter attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone during the year.
“Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations.
“They also use mosques, public places and houses as human shields.”
He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance.
The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters, as terrorists had been using them.
He added that law enforcement did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage.
“It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.”
He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social manoeuvre“, he said.
“In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is a gap between the public and the state — absolutely not.
“I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.”
He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan were, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism.

India-Afghan Taliban nexus
Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”.
In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy.” He specifically cited a professor from the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who, the DG ISPR said, had confessed to involvement in terrorism.
The military spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir.

 


He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan, under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating.
“Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played.
In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why other countries were not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil.
He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun.
The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”.
A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP.
On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security.
“No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.”
Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“
Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question of why terrorists had not ever targeted the party.
Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?”
“Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.”
Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said the kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces.
The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district governments, not the army.
“On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.”
He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added.
“The credit must go to the chief minister and the government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies].
“So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.”
The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution.
“Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed.
He said 127 projects have been completed, and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements had been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people.
He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that the distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended.
“By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police mandate all across Balochistan.
“This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.”
He said the Balochistan’s government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department as part of this.
The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus.
He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as other reasons behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province.
Moreover, the military’s spokesperson said two more areas that were being addressed under the revised NAP were narcotics — as it was connected to terrorism — and illegal weapons.
In both areas, he said the conviction rate was low.

“It is not the job of the army, but it has a direct bearing on our counter-terrorism efforts.”
Afghan repatriation
Gen Chaudhry said another important facet of the revised NAP was the repatriation of Afghans. He said Punjab had just one Afghan refugee camp that had been cleared and similarly, all 10 refugee camps in Balochistan had also been cleared.
In contrast, of the 43 refugee camps in KP, just five had been cleared, he said.
The DG ISPR said that of around 150,000 refugees repatriated from KP, 1.2 per cent had been “deported”.
Deportation “means that an individual had been checked and found to be illegally [staying]. [Deportation] provides the impetus for others to leave willingly”.
“In other provinces, the percentage of deportation is much higher. That means law enforcement agencies are not being given a freehand there (KP). […] The people and law enforcement bodies in KP want [repatriation of Afghans], but why are they not being utilised for this?” he said.
The DG ISPR said a Pakistan Land Port Authority had been established, which would contribute to NAP’s reinvigoration. The body would facilitate coordination among agencies operating at land ports, he explained.
He said the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre had also been established and termed it a “fusion of multiple agencies in one place”.
He said a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi recently, for which the “fusion of intelligence” happened at NIFTAC and provincial centres associated with the body.
He ended his briefing, asserting that the fight against terrorism would continue “with the singularity of purpose and singularity of narrative”.
“Those in uniform and those not in uniform have to fight together and win this fight. And no power in the world can stop us from winning this fight.”
‘Afghan border closure more beneficial than a loss’
When a journalist asked whether Pakistan was ready for a full-fledged war after availing multiple other options in recent months but “getting nothing out of it,” the DG ISPR disputed the phrasing. He noted that the ratio of terrorists killed to people martyred was now 2:1, up from 1:3 in 2021, and that Pakistan’s stance was being acknowledged globally.
“Pakistan was the first to say, two years ago, that attention needed to be paid to Afghanistan, where terrorists from across the world have gathered. Now, a United Nations report states that there are 20 regional terrorist organisations there.”
Gen Chaudhry further said, “We will trace them and their facilitators. No one should have any doubt about Pakistan’s resolve—its public, its armed forces, and its political and military leadership.”
Asked about the future of the Pak-Afghan border, the DG ISPR noted that the state’s top-most priority was the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan.

 

He stressed that the border had been closed for a reason, which had also been communicated to Kabul. About Pakistani students in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said the state will do whatever is necessary for their protection.
At another point, when asked about Afghanistan’s demand for a separate trade pact to reopen the border, the DG ISPR stated that the border closure only had “advantages” for Pakistan and no losses, as terrorism was permeating through it.
Asked what the “long-term solution” for Afghanistan was, the DG ISPR said, “We will play all the cards, and we will engage with them where we have to in a hard manner. Where we have to engage them diplomatically, we will do that as well.”
Asked if there was any hope of a change in Afghanistan’s attitude due to the recent joint statement by Pakistan and China, the DG ISPR said Islamabad and Beijing “see in the same way on regional terrorism“, and therefore cooperation in that domain is maintained. He said there was consensus in the entire region that Afghanistan had become the centre of terrorism.
On whether a regime-change operation in Afghanistan, similar to the recent operation in Venezuela, would be in Pakistan’s favour, the DG ISPR said it was for Afghans to decide. “We have to take care of our country. That is enough for us.”

 

On Pakistan’s future stance on such a development, Gen Chaudhry said the state would “curate its policy based on the circumstances at that time” and stressed that the foreign ministry takes the lead in such matters.
Asked about who was supporting the IS-KP terrorists in Pakistan, as the group and the Afghan Taliban were enemies, the DG ISPR questioned who termed them as each other’s enemies.
The DG ISPR asserted that terrorists have no ideology, whether it is the Daesh, Al Qaeda, TTP, FAK, FAH, or ETIM. “They have no nationality, humanity or ethnicity,” Gen Chaudhry said. “They all have one father — the Afghan Taliban. About them killing each other, you have been covering for a long time that one faction kills another.”

 

“As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no shade or colour of any sort of terrorist. We have no space or sympathy for any terrorist. I have already said that there is only one type of good terrorist: a dead terrorist,” the DG ISPR stated.
He stressed that the nation has to fight the war of narratives, technology, and intelligence. He quipped that terrorists were “baffled” by Pakistan continuing to move forward despite various militant groups thrown in the mix, along with sectarian strife and internal political facilitators.
Asked if Pakistan would inevitably carry out more strikes against the TTP in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR highlighted that in October 2025, Pakistan only carried out strikes “at the Pak-Afghan border area, on the terrorists that were infiltrating into Pakistan and those who were planning to go across into Pakistan and the places they were being organised”.
He stressed that it was the TTP, who were Pakistani citizens, who were struck. Gen Chaudhry noted that it was the Afghan Taliban who struck the Pakistani posts then, which gave Pakistan the “full right to respond” as its territorial integrity was attacked.
Questioned whether Pakistan had given the Afghan Taliban legitimacy by holding talks with them in Doha and Istanbul last year, the DG ISPR answered that they are the de facto rulers in Afghanistan. He pointed out that talks have been held during the entire period from 2021 to 2025, so there was “nothing new” about that now.
“Who else will you speak with?” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that since 2021, high-level delegation visits have taken place, 225 border flag meetings have occurred, 836 protest letters have been written, and 13 demarches have been issued to the same Afghan Taliban.
Issues in KP
Asked whether there was any hope of the federal government taking action to remove the hindrances in KP, such as by imposing governor’s rule, the DG ISPR said these decisions were up to the political leadership to decide. “This is for them to decide. They have to see multiple things. A soldier thinks in black and white [but] a politician thinks in multiple shades.”
“Our job is to separate the truth and the lies. We call a spade a spade,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the current counter-terrorism narrative of declaring terrorists Khariji began in 2023.
On whether the military was willing to hold talks with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the DG ISPR said dialogue was for the government to have.
Asked at another point what the solution to the lack of political will in KP was, the DG ISPR said politicians had to resolve those issues. “We are a democratic country. There is a parliamentary democratic system, which has the solution to this.”

 

The military spokesman asserted, “Our job is to give the state and the public our perspective based on facts and cold logic. We have no emotions in this.”
The military spokesperson termed the field marshal the “source of the clarity” of not holding any talks with the terrorists or giving them any space, and instead fighting them as per God’s directives. “The truth will come out if someone has personal vested interests and does not want to obtain that clarity.”
On the KP government‘s decision to abolish the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance and the army‘s plan of action for military operations, the DG ISPR said under Article 245, the armed forces were to defend Pakistan as per the federal government’s directives.
“The validity of any direction issued by the federal government under Clause 1 shall not be called in question in any court,” he quoted Article 245 as saying.
On how the military would launch any operation or conduct IBOs in KP when there was a difference of opinion with its provincial leadership, the military spokesperson pointed out that “operations” were continuing despite the KP CM saying they would not allow kinetic actions.
“Those who say we will not allow [operations], are their personalities or statements above Pakistan’s sovereignty?” he asked rhetorically.
“This is a war of our sovereignty. This is Pakistan’s war. No personality or politics is above Pakistan,” he asserted.
‘Cannot blame institution for certain persons’ acts’
Responding to a query about the military leadership’s involvement in the 2021 “rehabilitation” policy and their accountability, and whether calling out only the political leadership would be “selective justice”, the DG ISPR rebutted that the military leadership had input in the decision.
“We have a political narrative imposed on us wherein powers are taken in full but not the responsibility. The method to it is saying ‘we were powerless’. The government has the authority,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that both the current government and its predecessor had authority.

 

The military spokesman further said that some institutions were “not as empowered as they should be because of the politicisation that has crept into them over time”. “We repeatedly say not to impose any politics on us […] All political parties, political leaders and political ideologies, ethnicities, communities, religions, sects are equal for us as long as they are Pakistani.”
The DG ISPR, without taking names, alluded to Imran Khan and said he was “running his party like a dictator” and added that he was insistent on holding talks with the Afghan regime.
He quipped that he [Imran] was so empowered that he had even declared the then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as “father of the nation”, a title that is reserved for Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Gen Chaudhry added that then-intelligence chief — referring to Faiz Hameed — was “used for politics”. “You cannot put this [blame] on the institution; it was a field of characters.”</p><small>2026-01-06 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06180953074a86d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965461/european-leaders-voice-support-for-denmark-after-trump-claims-on-greenland' target='_blank'><strong>European leaders voice support for Denmark after Trump claims on Greenland</strong></a><br><p>A group of European leaders on Tuesday underlined their support for Denmark after US President Donald Trump again voiced designs on its autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland.
The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain as well as Denmark said that sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders were “universal principles, and we will not stop defending them”.
Washington’s military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears about Trump’s designs on Greenland, which has untapped rare earth deposits and could be a vital player as polar ice melts, opening up new shipping routes.
Greenland is on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States, and Washington already has a military base there.
With the situation in Venezuela more pressing, Trump quipped on Sunday that “we’ll worry about Greenland in about two months”.
The European leaders’ joint statement said: “Arctic security remains a key priority for Europe and it is critical for international and transatlantic security.
“NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up.
“We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.” They stressed that Denmark — including Greenland — was part of NATO.







“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” the leaders said.
“These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”
The statement was signed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
They added that the US was “an essential partner in this endeavour”.
“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” they said.</p><small>2026-01-06 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06133114023ced2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Procurement of JF-17 aircraft comes under discussion during meeting between air chief, Bangladeshi counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two military conflicts with India in 2019 and 2025.

 

The press release issued by ISPR said Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad.
The Bangladeshi air chief led a high-level defence delegation during the visit, it said.
“The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” it said.
According to the press release, the visiting air chief was accorded a guard of honour.







Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.
“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.
“The Bangladeshi air chief praised PAF’s combat record and expressed interest in benefiting from its operational expertise, seeking assistance in maintenance support for Bangladesh Air Force’s aging fleet and integration of air defence radar systems to enhance air surveillance,” the statement said.
“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” it said, adding that the delegation also visited key PAF facilities.
“The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-06 09:02</small></div><hr>
