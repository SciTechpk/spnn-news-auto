“I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday.
“They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said.
“The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted.
At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response.
“The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij,” he said.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.”
He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations.
“They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said.
He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”.
Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured.
“Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said.
As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said.
He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit.
In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said.
“All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted.
He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters.
He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khwarij with them” not only ran but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols.
He said that 12 Pakistan army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban.
He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians.
“At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted.
He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border.
“The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said.
“Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said.
He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan.
“We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Sibbi, Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said.
However, he added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”.
“It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271808409bb67cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976164/senate-adopts-resolution-condemning-unprovoked-afghan-taliban-aggression-calls-on-kabul-to-cease-hostile-acts' target='_blank'><strong>Senate adopts resolution condemning unprovoked Afghan Taliban aggression, calls on Kabul to cease hostile acts</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution that condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban, and demanded that the neighbouring country immediately cease all hostile actions and prevent the use of its soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan
The House, through the resolution moved by PPP Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman, condemned the recent unprovoked aggression and hostile cross-border actions from Afghanistan, describing them as blatant violations of international law, established diplomatic norms, and the principles of peaceful neighbourly relations.
The Senate declared that any attempt to challenge the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security of Pakistan constituted a direct affront to the dignity of the nation and would be met with a firm, proportionate, and decisive response.
“For over forty years, Pakistan has borne extraordinary economic, social, and security burdens in hosting millions of Afghan nationals, extending humanitarian assistance, facilitating peace efforts, and consistently advocating for Afghanistan’s stability in international forums often at immense cost to its own national development and internal security,” it said.
It expressed deep disappointment that instead of reciprocal goodwill, Pakistan continued to face hostile rhetoric, cross-border violations, and the persistent presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil, reflecting a troubling pattern of ingratitude and disregard for bilateral understandings.
“While Pakistan remains committed to constructive engagement, regional peace, and mutually respectful relations, its patience must not be misconstrued as weakness, nor its desire for stability mistaken for inability to respond decisively,” the resolution said.
It demanded that the Afghan Taliban regime immediately cease all hostile actions, prevent the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan, and honour their international obligations and commitments to peaceful coexistence.
The Senate also called upon the international community to take serious note of these developments and to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to adhere to international norms and prevent further destabilisation of the region.
Speaking in the Senate, Rehman said that Pakistan had exercised maximum restraint and upheld all diplomatic avenues, but recent hostile actions from Afghan soil had compelled the state to respond within the framework of the international law.
“The agreements that the Afghan Taliban signed in Doha have now been forgotten. Everyone can see the level of adherence to the commitments made in the presence of important stakeholders,” she remarked.
She emphasised that “Pakistan did not close the door on diplomacy at any stage, but was forced to respond”.
“Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, every country has the right to defend itself,” she said.
“A fundamental question before Afghanistan is whether it accepts responsibility for its own territory or not.”
She strongly rejected the mischaracterisation of Pakistan’s defensive measures.
Meanwhile, PTI Parliamentary Leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said, “Pakistan always comes first and that the entire Pakistani nation stands united against terrorism.”
He further stated: “In case of aggression, the nation has both the right and the resolve to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty.”
Senator Zafar said that since the birth of Pakistan, two countries — India and Israel had tried to damage it.
“These two nations came together and decided a long time ago that they would use Afghanistan’s soil to destabilise Pakistan,” he said.
“Today, two well-known criminals of the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have again gotten together,” he said.
“One is committing genocide in Gaza while the other is committing genocide in occupied Kashmir. Both have declared that they will use Afghan soil for their nefarious designs against Pakistan,” he stated.
“If any country commits terrorism on Pakistani soil, then it deserves full and mighty retaliation. No aggressor can be spared,” he said.
He said the Senate should use its collective wisdom and go beyond merely passing resolutions and propose practical regional long-term solutions.
“This is the Senate’s real job,” he added.
Senator Zafar also suggested establishing a permanent regional body, comprising neighbouring and regional stakeholder states, like China, to ensure compliance with a collective security framework addressing terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.
Such a mechanism, he said, would facilitate coordinated regional action, intelligence sharing, and monitoring of counter-terrorism commitments to effectively address cross-border security threats.
He also cited Article 4, which guarantees protection of law and due process, and Article 9, which protects the right to life and liberty.
Speaking on PTI founder’s health, Senator Zafar said, “The life, health, safety and release of former premier Imran are matters of paramount importance for the entire nation.
“The issues affecting Imran’s health directly relate to his right to life,” he said.
Senator Zafar emphasised that it was the state’s constitutional obligation to ensure the proper medical treatment and well-being of a former prime minister.
Addressing Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah’s calls for political dialogue, Senator Zafar said that meaningful dialogue required the government to fulfil its constitutional obligations first by allowing the PTI founder’s trusted doctors and legal representatives to be involved in his medical treatment.
“If the government maintains that proper treatment was already being provided, there should be no objection to permitting independent doctors chosen by Imran to participate in the process, particularly at a time when national unity is essential,” he said.
What is wrong with this request?” he asked.
Zafar stressed that adherence to constitutional principles, protection of fundamental rights, and national unity were essential for effectively confronting terrorism and safeguarding Pakistan’s future.</p><small>2026-02-27 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27174956fbc12b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976167/pm-shehbaz-visits-ghq-given-detailed-briefing-on-situation-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz visits GHQ, given detailed briefing on situation between Pakistan and Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday visited General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the military leadership gave him a “detailed briefing” on the situation between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The development comes after Pakistan’s security forces launched an operation, dubbed Ghazab lil-Haq, against the Afghan Taliban after it launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries on Thursday.
According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz said that zero tolerance should be adopted against the nexus between the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khwarij and its malicious actions.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
“The actions of the Afghan Taliban regime and Fitna al Khawarij against Pakistan are unacceptable,” he said.







He added that the country’s armed forces, under the leadership of Chief of Defence Forces Asim Munir, were always ready to defend the country.
“Pakistan knows how to defend itself against any aggression,” he asserted.
The premier also praised the professional capabilities of the armed forces for repelling attacks by the Afghan Taliban regime in the border areas and for retaliating vigorously.
“The entire nation stands with the armed forces for protecting the homeland,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-27 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27152510cbb47b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976140/ecp-again-suspends-notification-declaring-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-winner-from-pb-21' target='_blank'><strong>ECP again suspends notification declaring PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri winner from PB-21</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday again suspended the victory notification of PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri, who contested the Balochistan Assembly PB-21 Hub constituency in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections.
The development comes a day after the electoral watchdog declared Zehri the winner of PB-21.
“Pursuant to the order passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad dated 26th February, 2026 […] whereby Mr. Ali Hassan Zehri was declared returned candidate from PB-21 Hub, are hereby suspended, till further orders,” said a notification by the ECP released on Friday.
The recounting saga
Originally, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was declared the winner in the constituency.
But, a recount at 39 polling stations two months after the Feb 8, 2024, general elections led to Zehri being declared the winner.
While the original count had not even declared him the runner-up, the recount not only got him the top spot but also pushed down Bhootani to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
The significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored. They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was subsequently notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024.
The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void.”
Last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.
IHC issues notices on Bhootani’s plea
As the ECP kept the winner in the PB-21 constituency unchanged on Thursday, the IHC took up a plea filed by Bhootani against the ECP’s February 25 order.
Subsequently, the court noted in its written order that the petitioner had sought a declaration that the ECP’s Feb 25 was “illegal and unlawful”.
The petitioner further sought a direction to the ECP to uphold the election result as incorporated in Form-47 prepared after provisional consolidation, and also sought instructions for the returning officer to prepare Forms-48 and 49 accordingly, the order said.
Form-47 provides a detailed look at the number of votes cast and/or cancelled while Form-48 provides an insight into the number of votes cast for each candidate in a particular constituency. Form-49 is the official result of each constituency and candidate.
The IHC order further said that the petitioner’s counsel contended that the Feb 25 order, prima facie, was “illegal and was passed in clear violation of Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, 2017”.
The counsel argued that it was coram non judice (lacking proper authority) and that there was no reason or material available before the ECP to justify the order for recounting, the IHC noted.
Rather, the lawyer insisted, the ECP’s order was passed merely on the basis of a “hypothetical assumption”.
“Even otherwise, no reasons were recorded, which is mandatory under Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, therefore, the order, being coram non judice, is liable to be set aside,” the IHC order further quoted the lawyer as saying.
The counsel also argued that when the recounting order was issued, the ECP did not issue a proper notice to the petitioner, “and without affording an opportunity of hearing, passed the order in violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
The counsel requested the court to issue notices to the respondents “with the direction to file their report and para-wise comments within fortnight”.
After issuing notices to the respondents, the court decided that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next hearing.

However, the visuals are doctored.
The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false.
To reach this conclusion, iVerify Pakistan analysed the visuals for discrepancies, verified aircraft serial records and ran the content through multiple AI-detection tools.
Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored.
Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 26.
Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
On Feb 27, a pro-Afghan account shared an alleged video showing a downed Pakistani F-16 engulfed in flames on X with the following caption: “Big breaking news. This is a Pakistani military F-16, American-made, that Afghan defensive forces have shot down.”
The post gained 773,700 views.







The video with similar claims was subsequently shared by other propaganda — both pro-Afghan and pro-Indian — accounts, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
These accounts also shared still images of the alleged fighter jet.
A pro-Afghan account shared the image with the following caption: “Security sources reported that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani jet that had entered Afghan territory. Security sources have confirmed this news to several media outlets.”
That post gained 257,600 views.







Other shares can be seen here, here, here and here.
Another video of the same downed F-16 aircraft was also shared on X with the following caption: “Here’s his latest video.”
The post gained 80,200 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the current conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible mainstream international or Pakistani media outlets had reported any such alleged downing of an F-16 jet, but yielded no results.
A close analysis of the viral videos and images revealed discrepancies in the aircraft’s markings.
The serial number visible on the tail of the jet in the viral video is “85510”. The same serial number is also printed on the body of the aircraft in the viral video, whereas the body of the original F-16 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) does not contain any serial number.
Additionally, the size and proportions of the aircraft appear inconsistent when compared to verified images of an F-16.



Furthermore, in the viral video, a structure appears to be protruding from the tail of the aircraft and sits above the exhaust. However, upon closer inspection of actual F-16 aircraft images, this particular feature is noticeably absent, with the exhaust instead jutting out from the body.



Running the video through multiple AI-detection tools flagged it as being AI-generated. Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated.









When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models.
The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force.
Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular.
A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990.
The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified.



The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”.
The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top.
The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video, which returned an 83pc suspicion rate.



It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent.



Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like.

Spot gold edged down 0.1 per cent to $5,181.18 per ounce by 08:37 GMT. The metal has climbed 6.5pc so far in February, bringing gains for the seven months to a whopping 58pc.
US gold futures for April delivery were up 0.1pc at $5,198.10.
The benchmark 10-year yield fell to a three-month low on the day, decreasing the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-paying gold.
“There are two things (supporting gold). First is the tariff uncertainty which is there in the market right now, and on the other hand, the Iran and the US situation,” said ANZ analyst Soni Kumari.
The United States and Iran held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday over their long-running nuclear dispute, with the Omani mediator saying the two sides had made progress.
They plan to resume negotiations with technical-level discussions scheduled next week in Vienna.
“The latest rounds of talks have not produced a clear outcome, leaving geopolitical risks present but not escalating. This has kept gold at elevated levels, though it has not yet provided sufficient momentum to establish a sustainable bullish trend,” said Linh Tran, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com.
The US began collecting a temporary new 10pc global import tariff on Tuesday. However, the rate will rise to 15pc for some countries, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.
On the data front, the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits increased slightly last week, but the unemployment rate was steady in February.

The application was filed by PTI lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa on February 25, pursuant to Order XXXV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, after Imran underwent government-facilitated follow-up treatment for his eye ailment.
PTI lawyers Khosa, along with Naeem Panjotha, appeared before SC Chief Justice Yahya Afridi on Friday, seeking the scheduling of PTI’s application.
However, CJP Afridi told the lawyers that the “application was returned with objections a day earlier”.
“Your petitions will remain pending until further orders,” he said to the lawyers.
“There is no such application at the moment, on which proceedings can be held,” he added.
Khosa informed CJP Afridi that the PTI counsels had requested an early hearing, adding that the court had ordered the former premier’s treatment.
At this, CJP Afridi said that the court had not issued an order; rather, it was the government that had given assurances for the treatment.
“You should read the court’s decision again as the health issue is not pending,” CJP Afridi remarked.
Khosa informed the court that the transfer application was made “not on legal or political but humanitarian grounds”. In response to this, CJP Afridi held that the former premier’s recent medical check-up was carried out on “humanitarian grounds”.
“Please try to understand what I am saying,” Khosa insisted, at which Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan remarked, “I have known you since 1992, I understand everything you are saying”.
“Khosa sahib, you are a senior lawyer, you understand the procedure,” the CJP said, directing Khosa to meet the SC registrar.
“If the SC registrar does not give a copy of the objections, then you may come to court,” CJP Afridi said.
“If the order was issued yesterday, then how did no one inform us?” Khosa said.
As per a source, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also met CJP Afridi and sought the transfer of the incarcerated former premier to a hospital, citing family and party concerns about his health.
However, he was told that SC would not interfere while his cases remained pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Imran’s health, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for follow-up treatment on February 24.
However, his party took exception to the government’s “secrecy” regarding the treatment.
Meanwhile, the application, available with Dawn, was filed on behalf of Imran and named the Islamabad district election commissioner as the respondent, as it invoked the Toshakhana case in which the PTI founder was first arrested on Aug 5, 2023.
The plea had requested the SC that Imran be “immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, for proper treatment of his eyes from [a] retina specialist”.
The plea also sought Imran’s access to his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf, “who may be associated with all the procedures of examination and treatment”.
In his application, Khosa highlighted that Imran was 73 years old, adding that “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“The conduct of a medical examination in secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions,” he contended.</p><small>2026-02-27 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2715035788dc13a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976137/iran-urges-us-to-drop-excessive-demands-to-reach-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Iran urges US to drop ‘excessive demands’ to reach deal</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Friday that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its “excessive demands”, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war.
The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from US President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades.
Trump, on February 19, gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for armed groups curtailed.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump’s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States.
Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday told his Egyptian counterpart that “success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”.
Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”.
He said the next round would take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical talks at the UN’s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday.
Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna.
“We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran,” he said in a post on X.







Araghchi, in a post on X, called the latest round of talks “the most intense so far”.
“It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he wrote.







UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP.
‘Big lies’
US President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that Iran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
He also accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.
The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-President George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Iran is “not enriching right now, but they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can”, adding that Tehran “refuses” to discuss its ballistic missile programme and “that’s a big problem”.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic Republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon.
US Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Post on Thursday there was “no chance” that a long-threatened strike on Iran would result “in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight”.
Parallel to the talks is a dramatic US military buildup in the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week.
Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers, and three other combat ships.
It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers in the region.
The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.
However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests. Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.</p><small>2026-02-27 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2714544101f8822.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976128/where-do-pakistan-afghanistan-go-from-here' target='_blank'><strong>Where do Pakistan, Afghanistan go from here</strong></a><br><p>When states escalate, they are usually clear about their capacity and objectives. The Afghan Taliban, however, appeared to abandon that principle at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last night, triggering an intense military confrontation — including airstrikes and artillery exchanges — across the Durand Line as well as deep into Afghan territory.
The immediate backdrop of these tensions is not new. Islamabad has for years maintained that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a Pakistani terrorist group affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, operated from Afghan soil because of the official patronage it enjoys there.
Only hours before the latest crisis erupted, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi plainly stated that Pakistan’s quarrel was not with the Afghan people but with terrorist safe havens that threaten Pakistani lives.







That was the political setting; it emphasised the need for patient engagement and discreet signalling. The Afghan Taliban, however, chose to announce what it described as “large-scale offensive operations” along multiple border towns, in a language that was both public and declaratory.
A miscalculation by Kabul?
There may have been reasons why the Taliban regime opted for that course. Firstly, the border remains, in the Afghan political imagination, a colonial imposition.
Secondly, the Taliban leadership sought to signal that it would not acquiesce to cross-border action, especially after Islamabad’s February 22 strikes against terrorist sanctuaries on the Afghan territory, and frame the move as a defence of territorial integrity.
However misplaced that logic may be, given that the initial breach of Afghan sovereignty occurred when terrorist groups were allowed sanctuary there, the public mobilisation still serves a domestic purpose as it projects resolve to constituencies that expect the regime to defend Afghan soil.
Another calculation may have been that the escalation would remain contained. There is precedent. In October last year, after intense clashes, back channels and Qatari-Turkiye mediation produced a ceasefire. Though the understanding was uneasy, it worked. Kabul may have assumed that another round of tit-for-tat exchanges would similarly be cooled by intermediaries once tempers had flared.
But that assumption proved risky.
Pakistan responded not with ambiguity but with a named operation — “Ghazab lil-Haq” or “Righteous Fury” — and carried out airstrikes that reached deep into Afghan territory, including targets around Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia and Nangarhar. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif spoke in unusually blunt terms, saying patience had reached its limit and characterised the situation as open war.







Pakistan’s logic was clear. Terrorism inside the country surged after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, and even more sharply over the past year and a half. As a result, there is zero tolerance in Islamabad for threats perceived to be emanating from Afghan soil. In that context, a declared offensive by Afghan forces against Pakistani positions was unlikely to go unanswered because any perception of restraint in the face of a televised provocation would have carried both morale and political costs.
Resultantly, there was a spiral which neither side could easily control. Casualty figures differ widely, with claims and counterclaims dominating the official messaging.
Beyond the battlefield
But far from the borders and the war zones lies the question of strategic arithmetic. The Taliban’s strengths are rooted in unconventional and guerrilla-style warfare, whereas Pakistan’s advantages lie in its conventional force structure, air power and deterrent capability.
It implies that a head-on military contest would therefore never favour Kabul. That is where the Taliban appear to have misstepped; by shifting the theatre from deniable sub-conventional activity to overt interstate confrontation, they exposed themselves to costs they were ill-equipped to absorb.
Yet, force alone will not settle the underlying grievance. Islamabad’s central complaint is neither territorial expansion nor ideological contest; rather, it is the presence of terrorists who strike inside Pakistan while operating from Afghan soil.

 

The concern is not merely rhetorical. Year after year, United Nations Security Council monitoring reports have documented the continued presence and activity of the TTP in Afghanistan and described linkages between the group and the Taliban regime. The international record, therefore, is also clear.
Now that the issue is terrorist sanctuaries, the remedy cannot be spectacle. It has to be structural.
First, Kabul will need to address, credibly and verifiably, the question of armed groups operating from its soil; mere denials will not suffice.
Secondly, regional stakeholders with access to both capitals should be re-engaged at senior levels.Qatar and Saudi Arabia facilitated de-escalation in October last year. They are trying again. Others with leverage, including China and Turkey, can play quiet roles. Russia and Iran, too, have offered their good offices.
Third, both sides must reduce the temperature of public rhetoric since declarations of open war may satisfy domestic audiences but would complicate compromise, which has to ultimately happen.

 

There is no gainsaying the fact that there are no simple exits in such scenarios. Escalation acquires its own momentum, and each strike invites a reply, narrowing the space for discretion. As a result, economies suffer, border communities absorb the shock, and terrorist groups thrive.
For durable security, Islamabad must convert its battlefield advantage into diplomatic leverage rather than allow it to harden into permanent hostility. Meanwhile, this conflict must drive home to Kabul that a policy of hosting terrorist sanctuaries carries strategic costs.
If that lesson is not absorbed, what is now a crisis will solidify into a recurring pattern, and hostility will become entrenched.

The minister made the statement while addressing a meeting of the executive committee of the Organisation of Islamic Council (OIC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
The meeting was taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
Addressing the meeting, the foreign minister took note of the “latest illegal measures taken by Israel to convert areas of the occupied West Bank into so-called state property”, stressing that Israel’s actions reflected “an annexationist and expansionist mindset bereft of any regard for international law or humanitarian norms”.
At the outset of his address, Dar highlighted the continued ceasefire violations committed by Israel, its expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexation attempts, which he maintained posed a threat to any “prospect for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”.
He recalled that in September 2025 at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), “leaders and foreign ministers of a group of eight Islamic countries, including Pakistan, engaged with the president of the US to end the bloodshed in Gaza and [..] secure a permanent and sustainable ceasefire and advance a comprehensive peace process with Palestinian brothers and sisters”.
He further recalled that during the consultation held, the group of eight countries was “given assurances that annexation of the West Bank will not take place”.
However, the minister told the moot that “on the ground, Israel continues with brazen impunity to expand illegal settlements”.
He maintained that Israel’s actions amounted to a violation of “international law, the UN Charter, and the UN Security Council Resolution 2803”.
“These violations embolden further aggression, erode regional stability and trample the rights and dignity of Palestinians,” he added.
Dar called on the international community to “act decisively” to halt the violations being committed by Israel, and “uphold international law, as well as ensure delivery of the assurances made” in September 2025.
He recalled that a joint statement was issued along with eight other Islamic countries, which Dar said, “clearly highlighted our shared concern on Israel’s continued violation of the ceasefire and attempts to impose unlawful sovereignty, expand settlements, and enforce a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank”.
The foreign minister reiterated that “Pakistan remains fully engaged as part of the group of eight other Islamic countries to secure a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, immediate start of the reconstruction and a credible time-bound political pathway towards an independent Palestinian state”.
Dar vowed that Pakistan will continue to “remain at the forefront in advancing the Palestinian cause”.
He outlined that the OIC member needed to “collectively ensure the immediate reversal of all Israeli measures aimed at the de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory, including the occupied West Bank”.
He also called for the “protection of holy sites, including Al Aqsa Mosque”, as well as the “an immediate end to displacement (of Palestinians) and demographic manipulation”.
Dar stressed the need for the “full implementation” of the UNSC resolution 2803.
The foreign minister called for the immediate “reconstruction and recovery of Gaza with full Palestinian ownership” and “accountability for war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law”.
Recalling the recent statement made by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, suggesting he would not be opposed to Tel Aviv taking over large swathes of the Middle East, the foreign minister maintained that such statements were “ irresponsible, deeply concerning and condemnable”.
“At a time when initiatives such as the Board of Peace and the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza conflict [..] seek to chart a credible political horizon, remarks of this nature directly contradict those objectives and weaken collective diplomatic efforts.”
Dar held that Pakistan stood with “its brotherly Arab nations in defending their territorial integrity and will continue to oppose any attempt at legitimising occupation”.
Further, drawing parallels between Palestine and India-occupied Kashmir, Dar called on the OIC moot to “step up its efforts for a just resolution” for the dispute.
In his concluding remarks, the foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s stance on the Palestinian cause, stressing that the people needed “concrete measures to end their suffering and to secure liberation from Israeli occupation”.
“Pakistan, along with its brotherly OIC countries, stands ready to rise to this challenge with unity, resolve and purpose,” he added.
On February 25, OIC — along with Pakistan, the Arab League and 20 other Muslim and European countries — jointly condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
Dar arrived in Saudi Arabia on a two-day visit a day earlier.
He is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, adding that he would “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities” as well.</p><small>2026-02-27 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271107152f04bf6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976109/bears-take-charge-as-kse-100-closes-over-800-points-lower' target='_blank'><strong>Bears take charge as KSE-100 closes over 800 points lower</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the red, down 830.92 points from its previous close of 168,893.08.

According to officials, an intense exchange of fire continued throughout the night along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, the situation has since calmed after the firing subsided by morning.
Security sources stated that the Pakistan Army responded swiftly and in a coordinated manner by targeting multiple Afghan Taliban checkposts located across the border in Afghanistan’s Paktia province.
During the operation, Pakistani forces reportedly took control of five key Afghan checkposts and raised the national flag at the captured locations. Among the posts brought under control were two opposite Shawal, two facing the Angoor Adda sector, and one located opposite Zarmilan, security sources confirmed.
The operation, officials said, was aimed at restoring stability in the sensitive border region and effectively countering hostile activities.
Sources further revealed that Pakistani forces also destroyed an Afghan terminal in the Angoor Adda area, which was allegedly being used for military-related purposes.
As a result of the strong and coordinated response by Pakistani forces, Afghan Taliban elements reportedly suffered significant losses. Security officials confirmed that the Afghan Charlie Post and Afghan Babri Post in the Angoor Adda sector were completely destroyed during the engagement.
Authorities described the military response as a defensive measure intended to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity and preempt any potential threats arising from cross-border hostilities.
While the situation remains tense, security forces are said to be on high alert and fully prepared to respond to any further aggression.
Officials added that developments in the border belt are being closely monitored to prevent escalation and maintain stability in the region.
Guns fall silent in Landi Kotal
With guns falling silent on the border, authorities are busy ascertaining any damage caused by last night’s artillery firing from the Afghan side.
Residents in Landi Kotal said they spent a sleepless night due to the continuous noise of heavy gunfire, which caused panic among the civilians located in the area.
Residents in Landi Kotal also held a demonstration against what they called the unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side, calling for an early ceasefire.</p><small>2026-02-27 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271119325563021.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976050/forces-repel-miscalculated-attacks-by-afghan-taliban' target='_blank'><strong>Forces repel ‘miscalculated’ attacks by Afghan Taliban</strong></a><br><p>

PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s sec­urity forces swung into action after Afghan Taliban fighters launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries under the cover of darkness, the government said on Thursday night.
However, they received “an immediate and effective response” from Pakistan’s security forces, the information ministry said in a statement.
The action — dubbed ‘Ope­ration Ghazab Lil Haq’ — continued into the early hours of Friday, and by state media reports suggested the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had joined the response, targeting Afghan positions, including an ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, inflicting substantial damage.
However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press.
Authorities in Kabul had claimed launching a large-scale offensive, calling it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
Islamabad squarely blames Kabul for allowing terrorists aligned with the outlawed TTP and so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) groups to use its soil as a safe haven.
Earlier, in its weekly briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office had said that the strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan were carried out to pre-empt imminent attacks inside Pakistan, and that utmost caution was exercised to avoid civilian casualties.
‘Heavy casualties inflicted’
According to the information ministry, Pakistani forces had inflicted heavy losses on the Afghan Taliban in the Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors.
According to security sources, Afghan Taliban fired at various places on the Pak-Afghan border. A counter-attack saw their positions destroyed, forcing the Afghan fighters to flee, they said.
Giving details, sources said that Afghan positions across the border from the Chitral and Bajaur sectors were destroyed, while forces responded with full force to excursions in the Nawagai sector of Bajaur, Tirah in Khyber, Mohmand district and the Arandu sector of Chitral.

In a late night tweet, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that at least 36 Afghan Taliban attackers had been killed by Pakistani forces. However, subsequent reports by state-run Pakistan Television put the toll at 58.
In a post on X, PTV News said over 100 Taliban fighters had been injured, at least 12 Afghan posts had been completely destroyed, while five of their positions had been captured Mr Tarar also said that two Pakistan Army personnel had been martyred, while three were injured, in the line of duty.







He accused the Taliban regime of launching attacks in Pakistan’s border regions in defence of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outlaws, adding that Kabul’s patronage of terrorists had been laid bare for the world to see.
The information minister also refuted claims by Afghan and Indian media of killing or capturing dozens of Pakistani soldiers, asserting that the Taliban regime had resorted to “propaganda and lies to cover up its embarrassment”.
Ground reports
According to reports from areas along the border, Afghan fighters initiated hostilities around Iftar time near Torkham and Landi Kotal.
Local sources said that artillery shells were fired from the Afghan side, at least two of which fell in open areas, causing no damage to life or property.
In addition, Afghan families cleared by the authorities to return to their country — who were waiting at Zero Point for their departure — had been sent back to the Landi Kotal holding center as the security situation deteriorated at the border crossing point.
The Torkham border has been closed since October 12 last year due to the diplomatic row between the two countries.
Afghan shelling in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resulted in injuries to five people, including three women. The injured were being treated at DHQ Khar.
State-run Pakistan TV also carried visuals from a mosque that was damaged after being targeted by Afghan fire.



Witnesses in Mohmand also reported also reported intense fighting, but there was no word on casualties from the area.
An exchange of fire was also reported from Kurram and the Angoor Adda border area.
No quarrel with ordinary Afghans: FO
Earlier, at his weekly media briefing, FO spokesman Tahir Andrabi said that Pakistan’s actions over the weekend “were proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence”.
Military officials said the operation destroyed seven terrorist targets and killed between 70 and 80 terrorists. Afghan authorities, however, had alleged civilian casualties and condemned the strikes as a violation of their sovereignty.
Responding to questions about civilian harm, Mr Andrabi said the “intelligence-based selective targeting” of these seven terrorist camps and hideouts, located in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, were “primarily to ensure safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions,” he said.
Addressing bilateral tensions, he said Pakistan’s dispute was not with the Afghan people.
“In terms of people-to-people relations, we have nothing against the people of Afghanistan. The contentious issue is the terrorist outfits that operate in Afghanistan, and the official support and impunity being offered to that terrorism.
“As regards the people of Afghanistan, we respect them, and we have traditional historic linguistic ties with them. We do not wish any harm to the Afghan people,” he said.

“Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year.
In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.

Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories

Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas.
Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967.
‘Maximum land, minimum Arabs’
In the Gaza Strip, most of the territory’s 2.2 million inhabitants have been displaced at least once since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza”, the UN human rights office said in a report last week.
Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories in February.
“We will finally, formally and in practical terms nullify the cursed Oslo Accords and embark on a path toward sovereignty, while encouraging emigration from both Gaza and Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
“There is no other long-term solution,” added Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank.
“They want maximum land and minimum Arabs”, Fathi Nimer, a researcher with Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said, referring to a commonly used phrase used to describe Israeli settlement tactics.

The Taliban has restricted women’s movements and barred girls from education beyond primary school since coming to power in 2021, via a series of morality laws that also limit expression and employment.
Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a decree signed by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada last month “defines several crimes and punishments that contravene Afghanistan’s international legal obligations”.
“It provides for the use of corporal punishment for numerous offences, including in the home, legitimising violence against women and children,” he told a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva.

Germany deports 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan

“The decree, which is expected to come into effect soon, extends the number of offences that carry the death penalty.”
The decree also criminalises criticism of the de facto leadership and its policies, in violation of freedom of expression and assembly, he said.
Detailed provisions of the decree have not been officially published by the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice or Supreme Court, and this news agency has not been able to obtain the text from officials.
Turk urged the Taliban to rescind the decree, impose a moratorium on executions and end corporal punishment, saying women and girls face persecution under a system he likened to gender apartheid. The Taliban says women’s rights are internal matters and should be addressed locally.
Afghans deported
Germany on Thursday deported 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan under a new agreement reached with the Taliban government to allow direct expulsions, the interior ministry said.
Berlin had already resumed deporting criminals to Afghanistan in 2024, using Qatar as an intermediary. But the agreement reached to enable Thursday’s flight “creates a reliable basis for direct and permanent deportations to Afghanistan”, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said.
Those deported were men who had committed crimes in Germany, including sexual offences, bodily harm and drug offences, according to the interior ministry. “Our society has an interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country. That is why we are acting consistently and expanding deportations step by step,” Dobrindt said. Germany stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. But it resumed them as part of efforts to take a tougher line on migration to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Two deportation flights of convicted Afghans have left Germany since 2021: 28 were returned in autumn 2024 and 81 in July last year. Germany’s interior ministry had announced last year that direct discussions were taking place with the Taliban authorities. But the talks are controversial because Berlin does not recognise the Taliban administration in Kabul.

They also testified that no announcement was made about the fire to alert the people present in the shopping centre as the fire engulfed it. One of the survivors also pointed out that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exit points of the building were closed.
The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court was tasked with probing the devastating blaze and fixing responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the tragic incident.
Ali Haider turned up and deposed that he was working as a salesman at a luggage shop on the ground floor of Gul Plaza, and his workplace was located near a gate opening towards the M.A. Jinnah Road.

Wonder why no fire alarm sounded, most exit points were found closed

He stated that he was about to close the shop on Jan 17 at around 10:15pm and suddenly noticed smoke on the floor and thus, he left the shop and saw a fire erupting on the mezzanine floor.
The witness also said that he came back to his shop at around 10:30pm to check if things were normal there, as thick smoke was rapidly spreading across the floor. His shop also caught fire in the next 10 minutes, since the luggage / items in it were flammable.
Therefore, he further testified, he fell unconscious after two fibre luggage pieces burst close to him, and upon regaining consciousness, he found himself in a hospital.
Mr Haider, in his statement, maintained that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exits were closed, and he had not noticed any fire tenders or rescue agencies on the site before falling unconscious.
“It is further added that until the time of my falling conscious, there was no announcement of the fire made, nor did any person come to rescue the trapped people inside the building, either from the management side or from any government agency,” his testimony concluded.
Mohammad Junaid deposed that he had been working at a crockery shop on the mezzanine floor of the plaza for the last four years, and they were moving out after closing the shop at 10:15pm.
However, the owner of the shop suddenly realised that he had forgotten his cellphone inside the shop, and at the same time they noticed thick smoke spreading in the building and thereafter they realised severity of the smoke and fire, he added.
The witness also testified that he, along with two other persons who had worked in the same market / floor, attempted to escape at around 11:15pm and somehow managed to come out of the burning building through a bathroom’s side exit at around 11:30pm as there were no passages visible due to thick smoke.
Therefore, he further said, an Edhi ambulance had shifted him to a hospital due to chest congestion and suffocation caused by the smoke.
Mr Junaid deposed that no announcement was made about the fire until their evacuation, and nobody came to rescue the stranded people inside the building, either from the building’s management side or any government agency.
Around 80 people had lost their lives in the deadly inferno which erupted on the night of Jan 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished. The fire left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed.

ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday highlighted structural fiscal challenges being faced by the federal government and called for comprehensive and forward-looking reforms in the Natio­nal Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Speaking at the concluding session of the Pakistan Governance Forum, the minister, however, clarified that the constitutional vertical distribution of resources between the federation and provinces was not under review.
Mr Iqbal noted that from approximately Rs14 trillion in federal tax revenue and Rs5 trillion in non-tax revenue, around Rs8.2 trillion was transferred to the provinces under the NFC Award. After these transfers, he said, the federal government retained fiscal space of approximately Rs11.07tr against total expenditures of nearly Rs17.5tr.
“Nearly 50 per cent of federal expenditure goes toward debt servicing and approximately 25pc toward defence,” he explained. “After meeting these obligations, the federation must finance pensions, salaries, running expenses, development, grants, and social protection largely through borrowing. This equation is not sustainable.”
He further noted that despite social welfare being a provincial subject following the 18th Amendment, the federal government continued to fund major national social protection initiatives, such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), currently costing approximately Rs716bn. Additionally, he said, the federation bears financial responsibilities for Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
Turning to the NFC formula, the minister said with 82pc weightage assigned to population, there was little fiscal incentive for provinces to pursue population stabilisation.
“Similarly, with 10pc weightage link­­ed to poverty, provinces may inadvertently benefit from remaining poor rather than being rewarded for reducing poverty,” he said, proposing recalibrating the formula to incentivise poverty reduction, human development improvements, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, and population stabilisation.
Call for ‘true partnership’
Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who participated in the event via video link from Lahore, presented a comprehensive analysis of the objectives, challenges and current fiscal realities of the NFC Award while emphasising the need to protect the rights of smaller provinces.
She said the NFC should operate as a true partnership between the federal government and the provinces ensuring transparency, fairness and cooperation in all fiscal matters.
She noted that any future NFC framework must begin with a realistic assessment of national debt servicing obligations, defence financing requirements, climate vulnerability and water security challenges, which collectively place significant pressure on the federation’s fiscal space.
Ms Aurangzeb highlighted that expanding the tax base, improving the tax-to-GDP ratio, encouraging provincial revenue generation and promoting economic growth were essential to ensuring long-term fiscal stability.

The figure was down on 2024 when almost 9,200 deaths were recorded, but the International Organi­sation for Migration (IOM) said numbers nonetheless reflected the “global scale” of the crisis faced by migrants.
“The continued loss of life on migration routes is a global failure we cannot accept as normal,” said IOM Director General Amy Pope. She argued for safer legal routes, adding: “These deaths are not inevitable.”
Funding cuts for aid groups, crackdowns on humanitarian NGOs and limited access to data are making it more difficult to accurately track deaths, the UN agency said.
Sea crossings such as the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe remain among the deadliest routes for migrants, the report said.
At least 2,108 people went missing while trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2025, and another 1,047 died or vanished while trying to cross to Spain’s Canary Islands, according to the IOM. The actual figures are “likely higher”, it said.
The first two months of 2026 have already seen “an unprecedented number of migrant deaths” in the Mediterranean, the agency warned, with
606 people recorded dead on the crossing as of Tuesday — even as arrivals in Italy decline sharply.

• Children gathered at a tribal elder’s house to receive yoghurt after breaking their fast
• President Zardari extends condolences to victims’ families
QUETTA: Seven children aged between 8 and 14 years were killed and 22 others, including women and children, were injured when a gas cylinder exploded in a house in Chaman, a town on the Pak-Afghan border, on Thursday.
Officials said the tragic incident occurred in Killi Mahmoodabad, a locality on the outskirts of the district headquarters, Chaman.
According to police officials, children from neighbouring houses had gathered at the house of one of a tribal elder to receive yoghurt to eat after breaking their fast. Meanwhile, a powerful explosion occurred in the kitchen, rocking the border town. The blast blew off the roof of the kitchen and damaged other rooms of the house. The children waiting for yoghurt were buried under the debris.
Rescue teams, along with police, rushed to the site and launched a rescue operation. “Seven children were found dead when the debris was removed,” police said, adding that 22 injured persons, including four women and 18 children, were shifted to the Civil Hospital Chaman.
“We had received seven bodies of children and 22 injured at the Civil Hospital Chaman,” Dr Owais, Medical Superintendent of the hospital, confirmed. He added that the injured included four women and 18 children.
Police said the intensity of the blast completely destroyed the kitchen and badly damaged other rooms of the house. “The children lost their lives after being buried under the debris, while the injured were also trapped beneath the rubble,” officials said, adding that the women injured in the blast were cooking food when the gas cylinder exploded.
Four women and six children who sustained serious injuries were later shifted to the Civil Hosp­ital Quetta for further treatment.
The district administration expressed deep sorrow and grief over the incident, extended condolences to the families of the deceased children, and ordered an investigation to determine the cause of the explosion.
Authorities have urged citizens to take precautionary measures while using domestic gas cylinders to prevent such tragic incidents in the future.
Meanwhile, in a statement, Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, particularly those who lost their children in the blast. “I share the grief of the families who have lost their loved ones, and my thoughts are with them during this difficult time,” he said.
“May the departed souls rest in peace, and may the bereaved families be granted patience and strength,” he added. The president also prayed for the speedy recovery of those injured in the incident.

“This is not an additional cost. You were given a lower tariff. You enjoyed Rs15bn in free working capital for 90 days. Now cost recovery is being done through the FCA,” said Rehan Akhtar, representing the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division, at a public hearing at the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He was responding to a tirade by representatives of the business community from Karachi and Lahore — Rehan Javed, Tanveer Barry and Aamir Sheikh — who said the prime minister’s Rs4.04 per unit tariff reduction had been partly offset by a Rs1.78 per unit higher FCA for electricity consumed in January and recovered in March. They said the tariff rebasing from a fiscal year to a calendar year had been introduced as a facility for consumers but was resulting in higher FCAs because of a lower base rate.
Mr Javed said the FY26 reference fuel cost for January would have resulted in only 54 paise per unit in additional FCA instead of Rs1.78 per unit if the base tariff had not been shifted to the calendar year starting Jan 1, thereby imposing an additional Rs1.24 per unit burden. He feared the trend would be disastrous in June for all consumers.

Industrialists claim tariff relief has eroded; govt insists Rs15bn ‘free’ working capital is being recovered

Mr Akhtar said there was no change in the cost of power supply in either case. The lower reference fuel cost meant consumers were charged a lower electricity rate in January, and its actual cost would be recovered in March. A higher reference rate for January would have allowed distribution companies (Discos) to charge a higher fuel cost in January, retain Rs15bn for the following two months and then adjust it in March bills.
He said that, subject to Nepra’s approval, the new Rs1.78 per unit FCA in March would replace the existing 28 paise per unit FCA in February, resulting in a net additional FCA of Rs1.50 per unit. This would lead to a Rs2.55 per unit negative adjustment in the quarterly tariff after two months.
Mr Akhtar also explained that 46 per cent of industrial consumers and 35pc of agricultural consumers had availed themselves of a cheaper incremental package, which resulted in 14.4pc (11 million units) demand growth. As a few cheaper power plants — including nuclear, LNG and coal-based plants — were on forced outage for technical reasons, relatively more expensive plants, including furnace oil-based ones, were utilised to meet demand, leading to a higher FCA.
The CPPA reported that electricity consumption was 14.4pc higher than the pre-approved reference, around 12pc higher than the same month last year, and 8pc higher than December 2025.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Consti­tutional Court (FCC) ruled on Thursday that tax authorities can conduct raids and searches of taxpayers’ premises under Section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001, even in the absence of any pending proceedings against them.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a three-judge FCC bench rejected a plea moved by M/s Sceptre Pvt Ltd against a Dec 24, 2025, Sindh High Court decision that had validated a tax raid on the petitioner’s premises.
The petitioner had challenged the raid conducted by tax authorities under Section 175. It said the section should be applied in case of ongoing proceedings, adding that a notice under Section 176, requiring certain documents and information, could not form the basis for a raid.
Authored by Justice Farooq, the judgement explained that Section 175 empowered the tax commissioner to act for the enforcement of any provision of the ordinance.
The words used by parliamentarians under the law are “enfo­rcement”, and “enforcement” requires “breach”. When a law is breached, then it is “enforced”. If the statute had used the word “implement”, then the situation would have been different, the judgement said.
Thus, the examination of Section 175 shows that the words used were very cle­ar and simple, that this pro­­vision can be invoked for the enforcement of any provision of the law, the ju­­dgement emphasised, ad­­­ding that the SHC had correctly rejected the petiti­oner’s plea on the grou­nds of the precedent set in the earlier Agha Steels case.
Although the bench does not agree with the view expressed in the Agha Steels case, the petition is nevertheless liable to be dismissed, Justice Farooq observed.
Even if the requireme­nts laid down in the previous case were not strictly followed, the mere fact rem­ained that the tax commissioner — or an authorised officer — was empowered to act for the enforcement of the law under Section 175, he added.
In view of the referred provision of law and the factual aspects of the matter, the impugned judgment does not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference, Justice Farooq observed.
The cardinal rule of the construction of acts of parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention expressed in the acts themselves, Jus­tice Farooq said, adding that the rationale for beg­i­nning with the ordinary and natural meaning of the statutory language was that legislation was often drafted to address specific situations in clear and straightforward terms.
In such instances, the words used are precise and are not intended to extend beyond their plain scope or to be expanded into bro­a­der contexts, he added.
Since the primary obje­c­tive of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the lawmaker, the most appropriate and reliable method is to commence with the ordinary and clear meaning of the words used, as per the judgement.
“If the legislature says that a deed shall be ‘null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever’, how can a court of equity say that in certain circumstances it shall be valid?” Justice Farooq observed.
The principle emerging from that dictum is clear: where the language of the legislature is express and unequivocal, the courts are not at liberty to qualify, di­­lute, or contradict it, he said.
Applying the same reasoning to the present case, when parliament has exp­ressly provided that “in or­­­­der to enforce any provision of the law, the commissioner or any authori­sed officer will at all times and without prior notice, have full and free access, including real-time electronic access to any premises, place, accounts, documents or computer”.
How can a court of law then read into the statutory provision to say that a proceeding must be pending before Section 175(1)(a) of the law to trigger the raid. The answer is that it cannot. Courts must be restrained from granting relief in a manner that runs contrary to clear and express statutory provisions, the judgement said.

MANSEHRA/ISLAM­ABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday vowed that the government would go to any extent to eradicate terrorism from the country and those involved in militancy would not go unpunished.
During his visit to the residence of Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz in Mansehra to offer condolences, the PM assured the officer’s family of the government and the Pakistan Army’s full support.
“We, the federal government and the Pakistan Army, are with you and will never leave you alone, as Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz Tanoli is our pride and embraced martyrdom while gallantly commanding forces against the country’s enemies,” he assured the family members.
The PM said that Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz laid down his life while safeguarding the country, setting an example of bravery and courage. “The entire nation and I are proud of our martyrs and their families and would never forget the sacrifices they rendered for our motherland,” PM Shehbaz added.
He also announced the establishment of a Daanish school named after the slain officer to commemorate his martyrdom. He also visited the grave of the fallen officer to offer Fateha.
On Feb 21, Lt Col Gul Faraz and sepoy Karamat Shah were martyred in the suicide bombing during an intelligence-based operation in Bannu district, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said.
Ramazan package
The PM formally launched the Rs38 billion Ramazan package to provide financial support to deserving families across the country. While chairing a meeting on the Ramazan Relief Package, PM Shehbaz termed the assistance package “the largest and most comprehensive”, saying that the amount per household had been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000.
According to the premier, the disbursement will follow a “transparent digital system successfully used last year”. Cash assistance is being delivered directly to beneficiaries through digital wallets, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and respect for recipients’ dignity by eliminating long queues, he added.
The PM was briefed that 64 per cent of the eligible individuals had received financial assistance eight days into Ramazan, while the verification and distribution of money to the remaining beneficiaries had been underway.
The briefing also noted that 12 banks and fintech companies were partnering with the government for distribution, and the beneficiaries had completed 1.1 million digital transactions and over 1.227 million automated calls had been made to inform people about the assistance package.
The prime minister praised the performance of departments involved in the disbursement of the package, saying that the digital wallet system provided a convenient and transparent means of reaching beneficiaries.

India posted a mammoth 256-4 and then restricted Zimbabwe to 184-6 in Chennai to make their clash with West Indies in Kolkata on Sunday a winner-takes-all decider for the last semi-final berth.
South Africa hammered the West Indies by nine wickets earlier in Ahmedabad.
At Chennai’s MA Chidambaram stadium, opener Abhishek Sharma blasted 55 and Hardik Pandya an unbeaten 50 as India piled up the second highest total in the history of the tournament after being invited to bat first.
“I think we wanted to leave everything behind. We didn’t think too much about what we did in the league stage or in the last game in Ahmedabad,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav.
“With contributions from the top order right down to number seven, I think there was hardly anything missing in our performance.
He said they had not thought about what is now a knockout match against the West Indies on Sunday.
“Once we reach Kolkata, we’ll sit down and plan properly for that game,” Suryakumar said.
“For now, it’s about taking a day off, travelling, and relaxing.”
Zimbabwe, who stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, were never in the chase despite a brisk start as the asking rate kept rising.
Opener Brian Bennett was not out 97, the highest individual score by a Zimbabwean in T20 World Cup history, as his side exited the semi-final reckoning with a game still to play.
India’s left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh took 3-24 from his four overs.
‘Willing to improve’
“We are also a work in progress,” said Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza.
“We have a lot of youngsters, most of them are playing their first World Cup, first time ever in India for us.
“Not that I want to use that as an excuse, but certainly the lessons from the last game, from a batting point of view, I thought we took them really well.
“And you can see how quickly these boys are willing to improve and they showed up today.”
Zimbabwe’s bowlers conceded 510 runs in 40 overs in two Super Eights matches after West Indies posted 254-6 against the tournament’s surprise packages on Monday.
Raza won the toss and opted to field for the second match running, and again saw his bowlers flogged to all parts.
Left-handed Abhishek, who had struggled with three ducks in four innings in this tournament, hit four fours and four sixes to return to form.
Pandya and left-handed Tilak Varma, who hit a 16-ball 44, put on an unbeaten stand of 84 at the end, but India came up just short of the T20 World Cup record score of 260-6 made by Sri Lanka against Kenya in 2007.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson returned to the team to break the left-handed opening combination of Abhishek and Ishan Kishan and handed India a flying start.
Samson fell for 24 off Blessing Muzarabani but Abhishek kept up the charge, reaching his fifty off 26 balls in a 72-run stand with Kishan (38).
Abhishek fell to Tinotenda Maposa, caught at long-on, but his knock laid the platform for a big total. Skipper Suryakumar hit 33 off 13 balls.
Pandya finished with a flourish with two sixes off Brad Evans to get to 50 on the final ball of the innings.</p><small>2026-02-26 22:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261837090a6877b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975910/strikes-in-afghanistan-carried-out-to-ensure-safety-of-pakistani-citizens-prevent-imminent-terrorist-attacks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”.
FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing.
Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted.
In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”.
Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”.
“We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said.
He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad.
The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context.
He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”.
However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”.
Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”.
During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move.
The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region.
The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”.
The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan, “reinforce this conclusion”.
“These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said.
He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”.
In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”.
Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes.
“To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said.
The FO spokesperson was also asked to comment on the strengthening defence ties between India and Israel.
In response, Andrabi said, “We remain seized of the defence ties between Israel and India, including systems and platforms used by India against Pakistan. We are alive to the threat that they pose to our security and our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the regional peace and stability.
“Pakistan remains cognisant of these threats. As regards the future threats emanating from India, let me reiterate that we have robust military preparedness to defend and deter any Indian aggression against Pakistan.”
Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack
In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.”
On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis.
Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”.
FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”.
On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”.
He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that after an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Zhob on February 24, in which eight Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed, security forces conducted a comprehensive sanitisation operation on Wednesday to hunt down “hiding khwarij” belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces tracked down Khwarij on multiple routes and effectively engaged their locations. After an ensuing fire exchange, ten Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area,” it said.
The statement added that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
According to state-run APP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces over the successful operation in Zhob, noting that in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security personnel “are achieving major successes against terrorism”.
A statement carried by APP quoted the PM as saying that the entire nation was standing with the army in the fight against terrorism.
“We are determined to eliminate all kinds of terrorism from the country,” he said.







Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in a post on social media platform X that the successful operation in Zhib by security forces was proof their professional expertise and unwavering resolve against terrorism.
“Azm-i-Istehkam will continue until stability is restored in Balochistan,” he said.
