A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked.
He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. The attackers also torched the vehicle after the ambush.
Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road.
Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers.
Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun.
Condemnations
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack. Paying tribute to the fallen police personnel, he expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their families.







KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also strongly condemned the terrorist attack.
The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel.
Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices.
The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, as per a statement issued via the PPP’s media cell.
As per the statement, Bilawal paid tribute to the KP police for their “unwavering resolve and sacrifices in the war against terrorism”.







KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FCN) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said.
According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident, but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam.
As a result, three FCN personnel were martyred, and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed.
Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.

The Indian prime minister will visit Israel from February 25 to 26, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It will be Modi’s second visit to Israel.
According to the report, the opposition — led by Yair Lapid — is in a “standoff” with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana due to his decision not to invite the Israeli Supreme Court President Isaac Amit to attend a special session of the parliament “as is customary”.
The report said that Lapid on Monday urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Amit’s invitation.
According to Haaretz, Lapid, in a post on X, said: “We want to be in the session, we need to be in the session. Prime Minister Netanyahu must instruct Ohana to allow us to participate in the session.”







As per the report, Lapid, while speaking in the Knesset last week, warned that “boycotting Justice Amit is also a boycott of the opposition, and will not allow us to attend the session”.
He further said that the opposition “does not want India to be embarrassed, with the leader of a nation of one and a half billion people standing here before a half-empty Knesset”.
Haaretz quoted him as claiming that “the Indian embassy was ‘in a panic’”.
“Knesset speaker Ohana, however, in response to the boycott, maintained that he plans to invite former lawmakers to fill the seats of boycotting opposition lawmakers,” Haaretz reported, citing Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.
According to the report, Ohana also urged Lapid not to harm Israel’s foreign relations with “one of the most significant powers in the world,” terming the boycott an “illegitimate weapon in a political struggle”.
The report further added that the decision came amid the Israeli government’s efforts to “advance legislation to overhaul the powers of Israel’s judiciary”.

The development came as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defence Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman bin Hassan bin Ali Al Thani during an official visit.
“Regional developments were also discussed, in particular the situation in Iran and Afghanistan. Both sides emphasised the importance of dialogue, de-escalation and collective efforts to promote peace and stability in the region,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

In his meeting with Minister of State for Foreign Trade of Qatar Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Sayed, who is also the chairman of the Pak-Qatar Joint Business Taskforce, the premier stressed the “importance of enhancing bilateral trade volumes” between the two countries, as per a statement via the PMO.

Qatar Businessmen Association calls on PM Shehbaz
Separately, a delegation of the Qatar Businessmen Association (QBA), led by the association’s chairman Sheikh Faisal bin Qassim Al Thani, called on the prime minister, the PMO said in a separate statement.
The premier lauded the QBA’s “constructive role in strengthening economic and commercial linkages between Pakistan and Qatar”.

According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection on February 24.
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later.
Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations.
Reacting to the development, the PTI’s official X account said: “The situation demands transparency, not secrecy.” The party said such “clandestine actions only give rise to more questions.”
“What are they hiding?” the party asked, reiterating its demand that Imran be taken to Shifa International Hospital for “independent and transparent medical care”.
The PTI re-shared a video showing a convoy passing through at night, in which a person can be heard saying the vehicles were “returning from Pims”.
It could not be verified whether the convoy was carrying the former premier.







In its statement, the TTAP reiterated that Imran should be immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, where his treatment should be conducted in the presence of his personal physicians and family members to end all concerns regarding his health.
The party added: “We further demand an immediate explanation for this irresponsible conduct. Any future actions must strictly adhere to legal requirements and fundamental rights.
“A transparent and credible mechanism must be adopted regarding the medical care of the party leader to restore public confidence.”







In her statement on X, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said: “We do not trust the diagnosis or test reports from government medical facilities.”
She said: “From the news, we found out that Imran Khan was taken to Pims again in the middle of the night, supposedly for his second injection in the eye.
“When the law requires that family be informed before any medical procedure is conducted on a prisoner, why was the family not informed?” she asked.
Expressing her lack of trust in the government-affiliated treatments, she claimed, “There are already reports coming from Pims that the doctors are being threatened with serious consequences if any information is leaked about Imran Khan.”
Aleema further said, “Our family rejects their reports, even if they issue these doctored reports to the public.
“We stand by our demand that Imran Khan be examined and treated in Shifa International (Islamabad) by specialists, under the supervision of Imran Khan’s personal doctors and in the presence of his family.”
She contended that Pims was “not equipped to treat anyone for the alleged condition that has developed in Imran Khan’s eye”.
“It is criminal what this government is doing, and they will be held accountable for each and every violation and crime they are committing against Imran Khan,” Aleema asserted.







Former PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed it “totally unacceptable” that Imran was treated in the absence of his personal physicians.
Addressing Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, he said, “Now is the time to stand and be counted. Issue orders to ensure PM Imran Khan’s treatment in the presence of his physicians and in the hospital of his choice (Shifa International Islamabad).”







Night opted for due to ‘security, operational’ reasons: law minister
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Tuesday informed the Senate that the PTI founder was examined by a medical board comprising four expert specialist doctors at Pims, state-run APP reported.
He was responding to “various points” raised by Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, whose remarks could not be immediately ascertained as the proceedings are no longer being live-streamed on the official YouTube channel.
Tarar explained that the examination was scheduled at night due to security and operational considerations, stating that such arrangements helped minimise disruption at the hospital.
He said the decision was taken to ensure smooth medical procedures without affecting emergency services and routine patient care.
The minister stressed that matters relating to release, bail or foreign travel of a convicted prisoner fell under the jurisdiction of courts.
Tarar elaborated that the former prime minister was taken to Pims with his consent, where a board comprising both government and private specialist doctors conducted a detailed medical examination.
He informed the House that specialist doctors — including retinal expert Dr Nadeem Qureshi, the head of department at Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, and Prof. Arif, the head of ophthalmology at Pims — were part of the evaluation.
He stated that the medical board evaluated his health condition, including ophthalmological assessment, cardiac evaluation and general medical review.
The minister asserted that the examination was carried out within the framework of the law and jail manual, emphasising that medical procedures for prisoners were governed strictly under existing legal provisions.
Tarar said the law did not permit special arrangements outside the prescribed rules.
Tarar reiterated the government’s commitment to implementing legal provisions without discrimination, citing Article 25 of the Constitution regarding equality before the law.
In a post on X, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that Imran would be administered a third injection on March 24.
Chaudhry stated: “According to doctors’ instructions, there was an improvement in the eyesight after the first procedure, keeping in view which expert physicians recommended a second procedure.
“Today’s process was completed successfully and after clearance from the medical team, he was shifted back to Adiala.”
The minister reaffirmed that providing prisoners with medical facilities was the state’s responsibility, adding, “Even in this matter, all arrangements were transparent and according to the regulations.”







Another attempt for jail meeting
Tuesday and Thursdays are court-mandated days for Imran’s family members, lawyers and PTI leaders to meet him.
Subsequently, Imran’s sisters Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum headed towards Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated.
However, the PTI claimed they were stopped enroute by the police at Dahgal Naka.







During their visit, Noreen got hurt by “slipping and falling into a drain while going to offer prayers”, according to PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik.







In a post on X, Aleema questioned: “If they have nothing to hide, why are they refusing to allow us to meet our brother?
“If they have nothing to hide, and if they expect us to believe that he is receiving proper medical treatment, why are his personal doctors not being allowed to examine him?”
She contended that Imran has been “kept in solitary confinement for more than four months, with the exception of three 20-minute visits granted to our sister, Dr Uzma Khan, the last of which was on December 2, 2025”.







Opposition, family unaware of visit: TTAP
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said it was unfortunate that no one, especially Imran’s family, was aware of the hospital visit in advance.
Yousafzai said, “Just after getting the information, I contacted Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai and then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, but both were unaware of the development.
“Then I contacted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and asked about it but he was also unaware,” he narrated.
The TTAP spokesperson quoted Gohar as saying “let me check”, then said, “Later, he (Gohar) confirmed that Khan sahib was brought to Pims but has been shifted back to the Adiala jail.”
Yousafzai asserted that it was the right of PTI founder’s family to know about the treatment.
“Even if the law permits the government to keep it secret, the cultural traditions do not allow anyone to do what was done on Tuesday,” he argued.
He contended: “This action reflects a non-transparent approach and constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental human and legal rights of a former premier and national leader.
“Every person in custody — particularly a former prime minister — is entitled to have their family members and trusted personal doctors present during medical examinations and treatment to ensure transparency.”
In his post on X, Gohar said, “At 2am today, I was informed this much in a message that Khan sahib was brought to Pims for administering an injection.”
“I was not informed in advance,” he insisted.
The PTI chairman stressed, “Our demand even today is the same that a complete checkup and treatment of Khan sahib be performed in Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors and family members.”







The government has said it had invited Gohar to be present during an examination of Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 15, but the PTI leader refused, citing party consultations.
Gohar meets SC registar; TTAP protests outside court
Separately, Gohar and MNA Ali Muhammad Khan met the Supreme Court (SC) registrar and requested the early fixation of Imran’s cases pending before the court.
Gohar told the SC registrar the matter of the PTI founder’s health was “not political but humanitarian”, stressing that they have sought his access to personal physicians and family members.
The SC registrar reportedly told Gohar to submit an application seeking the early fixation of cases and assured him of the same once the plea was received.
Speaking to the media outside SC, Gohar said his party had only one demand: “Give justice to Imran.”
He emphasised, “Our request is that a treatment of his choice be provided as per the jail manual.”
Noting that the SC registrar told him to submit a plea for early fixation, Gohar said PTI lawyer Latif Khosa would file it.
“Neither we nor his family was told about the PTI founder being brought to the hospital last night,” he said, adding that he was informed after the ex-premier had been taken back to prison.
Ali Muhammad highlighted, “A former prime minister was brought and taken back in the dark of the night.
“Smugglers operate in the night; not states,” the MNA quipped.
“Our prayer is that the government report of Khan sahib recovering is true. The question is why is there so much secrecy if the report is true?” he wondered.
Meanwhile, members of the TTAP staged a protest outside the SC for a second day.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; senators Abbas, Faisal Javed Khan and Azam Swati; and MNAs Aamir Dogar, Shandana Gulzar and Shahid Khattak were among those present.
They raised slogans calling for Imran’s release from jail.
The TTAP leaders had also protested outside SC on Monday, demanding that Imran’s cases be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.







2nd Pims visit
Confirming Imran’s hospital visit, a Pims doctor said: “Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: a consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and a consultant physician.
“After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with a second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under the guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and a consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of Pims and Al-Shifa Eye Hospital.”
The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, the Pims doctor said about Imran’s treatment.
During the course of his stay, Imran remained vitally stable before, during, and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow-up advice, and the documents, the doctor stated.

 

Another Pims doctor, wishing not to be quoted, told Dawn that security in the hospital was heightened on Monday night.
“At 11:30pm, Imran was brought in the hospital and he was taken back at around 1:30am,” he added.
Replying to a question, the doctor said Imran’s tests and physical examination were held to determine whether he was fit for the procedure.
“The procedure was held in the same operation theatre in which he was brought last time. After the procedure, Khan sahib was shifted to the recovery room and finally, when it was confirmed that he was stable, he was allowed to be shifted to the Adiala jail,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241729320e92835.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975424/australian-pm-albanese-evacuated-from-residence-after-security-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Australian PM Albanese evacuated from residence after security threat</strong></a><br><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was evacuated from his residence in Canberra late on Tuesday following a security threat, and returned several hours later after nothing suspicious was found, ABC News reported.
Albanese was evacuated from The Lodge, his official residence in the capital Canberra.
National broadcaster ABC reported the threat sparked a significant police operation, and led to the prime minister being taken to another location for several hours.







Police said they had responded to an “alleged security incident” around 6pm (07:00 GMT), without giving more details on the nature of the incident.
“A thorough search of a protection establishment was undertaken and nothing suspicious was located. There is no current threat to the community or public safety,” an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said in a statement.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24172602170aa89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975423/paris-st-germain-defender-achraf-hakimi-to-face-trial-for-rape' target='_blank'><strong>Paris St Germain defender Achraf Hakimi to face trial for rape</strong></a><br><p>Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi is to face a rape trial, the defender, who plays for Paris St Germain and the Moroccan national squad, said in a social media post on Tuesday. He denies the allegation.
“Today, a rape accusation is enough to justify a trial, even though I deny it and everything proves it’s false,” Hakimi said in a post on X.







“This is as unjust to the innocent as it is to the genuine victims. I calmly await this trial, which will allow the truth to come out publicly,” he said.
Hakimi’s lawyer Fanny Colin said a trial had been ordered and the prosecutor in the Nanterre suburb of Paris confirmed.
“A trial has been ordered on the basis of an accusation that rests solely on the word of a woman who obstructed all investigations, refused all medical examinations and DNA tests, refused to allow her mobile phone to be examined, and refused to give the name of a key witness,” Colin said.
PSG coach Luis Enrique when asked about it at Tuesday’s press conference, ahead of the Champions League play-off second leg match with Monaco, said: “This matter is in the hands of the authorities.”
The plaintiff’s lawyer, Rachel-Flore Pardo, said her client was relieved to hear the case was going to court.
She said the judiciary had been exemplary in handling the case.
But its treatment in general showed “there are still areas where the #MeToo movement has not yet breached the sound barrier, chiefly in men’s football,” she added.
The Nanterre prosecutor’s office had opened an investigation in 2023 after an allegation of rape was made against him.
The prosecutor confirmed on Tuesday that Hakimi’s case had been sent to trial.
Paris St Germain will face Monaco in Wednesday’s return leg of their Champions League knockout round playoff tie. Hakimi was in the initial squad list published last Tuesday.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24161147a4de67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975415/senate-deplores-netanyahus-plan-to-forge-alliances-with-india-others-against-muslim-nations' target='_blank'><strong>Senate deplores Netanyahu’s plan to forge alliances with India, others against Muslim nations</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks about a plan to ally with India and other countries to counter Muslim nations.
The resolution moved in the House by PPP’s Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan deplored the continued provocative steps and statements by the Israeli leadership that threatened the regional and international peace and stability, including the latest statement about forming “alliances” against Muslim nations.
Addressing a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country “will create an entire system — essentially a kind of hexagon of alliances — around or within the Middle East”, Times of Israel reported.
Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus, and “unnamed Arab, African and Asian countries”, the report added.
“The intention here is to create an axis of countries that see reality, the challenges, and the goals in the same way, in contrast to the radical axes,” he was quoted as saying.
“Both the radical Shia axis, which we have hit very hard, and also the emerging axis — the radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu added.

 

The Indian PM is also set to visit Israel this week.
In its resolution passed today, the Senate also condemned any attempts by Israel to undermine the “sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of brotherly Islamic countries and rejected” the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of Somalia.
On Dec 26, 2025, Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, sparking strong condemnation from Pakistan, 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The Senate also condemned in the strongest possible terms the Israeli occupying power’s continued violations of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as well as its blatant disregard of international law, the UN Charter, relevant UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The House took strong exception to the “vile proclivity of the leadership of the Israeli occupying power towards diminishing the unity and integrity of Muslim Ummah on political and ideological grounds”.

 

It rejected any attempt by Israel to change the legal or historical status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the status of the holy sites; enforce any new legal and administrative reality in the occupied territory, especially the Occupied West Bank; expand its illegal settlement activities in the occupied territory, and encourage settler violence; or forcibly displace Palestinians from their land.
The Senate urged the international community to “end Israeli impunity and to hold it accountable for its crimes against humanity, as well as its provocative actions that pose a threat to all regional countries”.
It demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories; increased, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza, including through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA); and an early start of the recovery and reconstruction process in Gaza.
The House reaffirmed historic and unwavering support of the people of Pakistan for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24171907769c715.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975414/pakistan-attracts-79-new-foreign-firms-rs407bn-investment-in-three-years' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan attracts 79 new foreign firms, Rs40.7bn investment in three years</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is attracting substantial foreign interest across a broad spectrum of sectors, including energy, logistics, information technology, agriculture, mining, and digital infrastructure, with much of this activity taking place through partnerships and joint ventures with local companies.
Over the past three years, 79 new foreign companies have commenced operations in the country, while foreign firms invested Rs40.7 billion in key sectors during the same period.
According to data released by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), 1,157 foreign companies are currently registered and operational in Pakistan.
Nineteen foreign companies exited the market over the last three years. In 2023, 31 new companies entered Pakistan while six ceased operations. In 2024, 21 entered and nine exited. In 2025, 27 new companies registered, compared to just four closures.
Beyond new market entries, foreign participation has also expanded through equity transactions. A total of 61 shareholding transactions involving foreign companies and local entities were recorded during this period.
Of these, 29 involved transfers to other foreign companies, four to foreign individual investors, 20 to local individual investors, and eight to local corporate entities. Many of these deals were driven by global portfolio restructuring among multinational corporations.
Saudi Arabia’s Wafi Energy acquired Shell Pakistan’s operations as part of Shell’s global reorganisation strategy. Dubai-based PTA Global Holdings secured a majority stake in Lotte Chemical Pakistan following an international agreement between Lotte Chemical and TotalEnergies. Switzerland’s Gunvor Group and Total Parco Limited acquired equal stakes in TotalEnergies Pakistan, while Saudi Aramco purchased a 40 per cent equity stake in Gas & Oil Pakistan Limited.
In logistics, UAE-based DP World entered into a joint venture with the National Logistics Corporation, strengthening Pakistan’s transport and supply chain infrastructure.
In the digital sector, Bazaar Technologies acquired Wemsol, and Saudi Arabia’s Waqub Data Company secured an 80pc stake in Pakistani technology firm Woot Tech.
In the telecommunications sector, PTCL acquired Telenor Pakistan’s operations as part of regional restructuring in the telecom sector.
In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer transferred its Karachi manufacturing plant and related assets to Lucky Core Industries to ensure continuity of local production, while France’s Sanofi sold its majority stake to a local investor consortium, after which the company was renamed Hoechst Pakistan Limited.
Agriculture has attracted strategic foreign partnerships as well. Italy’s Euricom S.p.A. acquired a 50pc stake in Fatima Euricom Rice Mills. Meanwhile, Netherlands-based Berkeley Square Holding B.V. obtained 50pc shareholding in Ogilvy & Mather Pakistan, Mindshare Pakistan, and Soho Square Pakistan.
The mining and minerals sector has seen growing international interest, with investment activity from Barrick Gold, Strategic Metals US, and Nova Minerals US.
The electric vehicle segment is also emerging as a new frontier, with entrants such as BYD, Chery Automobile, and NWTN Motors exploring opportunities in the local market.
In technology and telecommunications, global firms including Google, Samsung, Relational, IceWarp, Pro Device, and Russoft Synercon are expanding operations.
Infrastructure development is being supported by Abu Dhabi Ports and Portugal’s Mota Engil Group.
Existing foreign investors have likewise deepened their commitments. Mashreq Bank has launched and is expanding Pakistan’s first digital bank, while Kuwait-backed Raqami Digital Bank plans to invest $100 million.
UAE telecom group e& announced the successful completion of the acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL, a subsidiary in which it holds a 23.4pc effective economic interest.
Nestlé is investing an additional $60 million, and VEON Group has increased its investment in Mobilink Bank.
The Engro Jazz consortium is committing more than $550 million toward digital infrastructure expansion.
Additional major inflows include a $1 billion commitment from the UAE government through a local partner, a $160 million cement capacity expansion by the Mansha Group, the entry of global logistics firm Nippon Express into TCS, and renewed capital injections into the mining and minerals sector.
Meanwhile, the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has accelerated industrial cooperation, resulting in 24 business-to-business agreements worth more than $1.5 billion, alongside memoranda of understanding exceeding $7 billion across agriculture, renewable energy, information technology, minerals, and industrial relocation.
Overall, this signals an influx of foreign capital in traditional manufacturing-heavy industries along with digital and technology-focused industries.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241537507533ebc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973915/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-when-staying-up-late-feels-like-taking-control' target='_blank'><strong>Revenge bedtime procrastination: when staying up late feels like taking control</strong></a><br><p>The glow of his phone screen often marks the end of Mohammad Daniyal Shahid’s day.
A final-year MBBS student, buried in exam preparation, says his nights are the only moments that feel truly his. “The whole day is scheduled, lectures, wards, studying,” he says. “Night is the only time that feels like my own.”
Between lectures, clinical rotations and the relentless pressure of becoming a doctor, Daniyal squeezes his passions, travel, fitness and photography, into whatever hours he can reclaim.

But when he checks his screen-time report, often stretching beyond four or five hours, the realisation hits. “I think I’ll scroll for a few minutes, and suddenly it’s 2am,” he says. “That’s when I realise I’ve delayed sleep again.”
Those late-night hours are both comforting and costly. For Daniyal, they are a way of taking control, a quiet rebellion against packed schedules and constant responsibilities. “It feels like I’m reclaiming time,” he says. “But the next day is brutal.”
The morning after, he says, brings heavy fatigue, fading motivation, and the feeling that one bad night can derail an entire week. “You wake up tired, irritated, and then the cycle repeats,” he adds.
Daniyal has tried small fixes, drinking water before touching his phone, experimenting with supplements and imagining a future where sleep trackers and cleaner air might help him rest better. Still, he admits that scrolling before bed has become a ritual he wants to break.
“I know it’s unhealthy, but it’s hard to stop,” he says. “It has become a habit.”
Daniyal is not alone.
Amna Aslam, a second-year university student, describes her relationship with her phone as both disciplined and indulgent.
“I use my mobile most of the time during the day, but I limit my usage during my blocks and modules,” she says. “During exams, I avoid any kind of usage, even YouTube Shorts.”

“But nights are different. At night, I reward myself for the work of the whole day. For some dopamine rush, I use my mobile phone for 30 to 120 minutes,” she explains.
Instagram is her main source of entertainment, but she admits it is highly engaging. “It requires a lot of time, so I limit my use of Instagram to weekends only. In my daily routine, my usage is limited to WhatsApp, YouTube Shorts and Netflix.”
Amna prefers shows with multiple short episodes and watches them at a faster speed. “As a university student, I have developed a habit of watching everything at 1.5x to 2x speed to cope with my workload,” she says.
However, she admits that the habit has sometimes led to consequences. “There were times when my excessive mobile phone usage at night led to serious problems, like missing my classes or lectures the next day, or feeling very drowsy,” she says.
Reclaiming time after dark
What Daniyal and Amna experience is known as “revenge bedtime procrastination”, a phenomenon that refers to the deliberate delay of sleep to engage in activities individuals feel they do not have time for during the day.
These activities may include scrolling through social media, watching videos, chatting online, or simply staying awake to enjoy uninterrupted personal time. While it is often framed as relaxation or “me time”, it comes at the cost of adequate sleep.

The term “bedtime procrastination” was first introduced in an academic paper published in 2014, which described it as going to bed later than intended without any external reason.
The word “revenge” was later added in China, where long working hours — sometimes stretching to 12 hours a day — led workers to sacrifice sleep as a way of regaining control over their lives.
The concept gained wider attention after a viral post by journalist Daphne K. Lee, who described the behaviour as something that happens when “people who don’t have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early to regain some sense of freedom during late-night hours”.
From exhausting routines to everyday habits
While the phenomenon is closely linked to China’s demanding “996” work culture, its reach is no longer limited to one country. A BBC report citing a 2018 national survey found that nearly 60 per cent of people born after 1990 in China were not getting enough sleep, particularly those living in major cities dominated by technology-driven work environments.
Experts say similar patterns are now visible globally. Extended screen time, blurred boundaries between work and rest, remote employment, and academic pressure have normalised delayed sleep, especially among young people.
When delayed sleep becomes a clinical concern
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Bilal Saleem, General Physician at the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur, says patients who seek medical help for sleep-related issues often do so when they are already experiencing psychological or psychiatric conditions.
“Most patients who come to us are already in a diseased state, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia or manic episodes,” Dr Saleem explains. “In mania, there is pressure of thoughts; in anxiety, people wake up due to overthinking and restlessness.”
He adds that people without diagnosed mental health conditions rarely visit doctors simply to explain why they sleep late.
“People don’t come and say, ‘Doctor, I sleep late because I use my phone too much,’” he says. “They usually think it is normal behaviour and not a medical problem, so they never report it.”

“For the general population, the common reasons are lifestyle-related factors such as excessive mobile use, social media, daytime sleeping, work stress or night shifts,” he says.
Dr Saleem notes that people who approach doctors with complaints related to revenge bedtime procrastination usually do so when they are already in a diseased state, often linked to underlying mental health conditions.
“Normal people don’t consider delayed sleep a health issue,” he adds. “They only seek help when their condition affects work, studies or mental health. Otherwise, they adjust their routine themselves and assume it is just part of modern life.”

He says a major reason people do not report the condition is a lack of awareness that what they are experiencing is a behavioural or health issue.
“Most people don’t even know there is a term for this. They think sleeping late is normal in modern life,” he says. “They don’t realise that this habit is quietly damaging their health, productivity and emotional well-being.”
Many young people, he explains, normalise exhaustion and irregular sleep patterns as part of academic pressure, work culture and digital life. “They say, ‘Everyone sleeps late, so what is the problem?’ But over time, it makes their lifestyle difficult. They feel tired, lose focus, become irritable, and their mental health suffers.”
According to the physician, people usually seek help only when the consequences become severe. “When studies, work, or relationships start getting affected, then they realise something is wrong. Before that, they just adjust and accept it as routine.”
He adds that awareness is key. “If people understood that poor sleep is not just a habit but a health issue, they would seek help earlier and change their routines.”
Psychology of control and autonomy
From a psychological perspective, revenge bedtime procrastination is closely linked to autonomy and control. Qulchaq Alam, an MPhil student at the University of Karachi and a practising psychologist, explains that individuals who spend their days following schedules imposed by work, study, or family often use nighttime to reclaim personal freedom.

“Late-night hours become the only time when they can choose what to do without interruption,” she told Dawn. “While doing so provides temporary relief and a sense of control, the coping mechanism becomes counterproductive when practised regularly.”
She added that over time, disrupted sleep patterns can lead to physical fatigue, emotional instability and broader psychological problems.
Youth, self-worth and emotional regulation
Dr Farah Iqbal, psychologist and professor of criminology at the University of Karachi,  explains that sleep procrastination among youth is strongly associated with emotional dysregulation and unresolved psychological stress.
“Fear, anxiety and uncertainty, particularly those intensified during the pandemic, have impaired young people’s ability to manage emotions effectively.”

She noted that low self-esteem also plays a central role. “In the real world of work and education, young people often feel undervalued and unable to compete. Constant comparison with peers of the same age who appear more successful creates a sense of deprivation, damaging self-esteem.”
Social media, she said, then becomes an alternative space where individuals can construct identities, play with self-image and escape feelings of inadequacy.
Dr Iqbal added that such behaviour is not innate or natural. It has developed over time due to early exposure to gadgets, changing work patterns and a lack of healthy leisure during the day, which pushes young people to treat nighttime as their only personal space.

“Revenge bedtime procrastination also reflects resistance. When young people cannot express injustice, frustration or lack of control during the day, they take revenge at night by staying awake.”

“It can also function as a subtle act of defiance against authority figures like parents or guardians who insist on early bedtimes and allow youth to assert control over their own time,” she said.
Why does ‘FOMO’ keep young people awake?
Fear of missing out, or FOMO, often intensifies the behaviour. Teenagers stay awake watching shows, scrolling through feeds or replying to messages, not always out of interest, but out of fear of being excluded from conversations, trends or shared experiences. The need to stay connected overrides physical exhaustion, pushing sleep further into the background.
“You don’t want to be the only one who doesn’t know what everyone is talking about the next day,” Daniyal says. “So you keep scrolling, even when you’re tired.”
For Daniyal, the quiet rebellion of staying awake feels temporary, tied to the pressures of medical school and the uncertainty of a demanding career path.

“It’s my way of taking back some control,” he says. “But it’s a control that costs me energy the next day.”
Yet he knows the irony of sacrificing sleep while training to become a doctor.
“Sleep is one of the most underrated pillars of health,” he says, aware that poor rest affects mood, productivity and physical well-being.
He hopes that once exams are over and life slows down, nights will no longer be spent chasing time through endless scrolling, but reclaiming it through the deep, restorative sleep he believes is essential — not just for patients, but for himself.

Topline Securities noted that the session witnessed pronounced volatility, with the index staging a brief rebound to an intraday high of +1,546 points before intensified selling pressure pushed it to a low of –3,783 points.
Despite the decline in points, trading activity remained robust, with total volumes clocking in at 687 million shares and turnover reaching Rs38.4 billion.
The top active stocks were led by K-Electric Limited, falling 1.17pc to Rs7.57 at a volume of 64,848,829, followed by The Bank of Punjab, declining 1.62pc to Rs29.70 at a volume of 49,139,683, and Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling 0.76pc to Rs 1.31 at a volume of 45,981,935.

This 0.85pc fall from its previous close of 167,691.08 points comes on the heels of the index’s bloodbath on Monday, the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with the KSE-100 losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points, the steepest single-day decline in history, on February 19.
Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, noted that the market is in “correction mode.” He stated that the current sell-off “appears to be driven by above-average foreign selling, Reko Diq-related concerns, softer corporate results, and stock futures unwinding”.
Interestingly, he cautions against deeming this as a bearish market, calling it an “11pc correction instead”.







AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.
Investors will also be looking towards corporate earnings reports for a possible upside.
Pakistan Oilfields Ltd announced its 2QFY26 results today. The company recorded a profit of Rs6.3bn, down 17pc YoY but up 16pc QoQ. This takes 1HFY26 earnings to Rs41.29/share, up 16pc YoY, according to Topline Securities.
The brokerage house noted that earnings came out higher than expectations, driven by higher-than-expected other income and a lower Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which stood at 26pc in 2QFY26, compared to 37pc in 2QFY25 and 33pc in 1QFY26.
Additionally, Hub Power Company announced its 2QFY26 results today. The company reported earnings of Rs10.6bn, an increase of 152pc YoY. Their profits were down compared to the previous quarter by 9pc due to higher ETR. According to Topline Securities, this result came lower than expectations due to a higher-than-expected ETR.</p><small>2026-02-24 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24144223e061f0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975412/unidentified-attackers-blow-up-school-in-south-waziristan-no-casualties-reported' target='_blank'><strong>Unidentified attackers blow up school in South Waziristan, no casualties reported</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Unidentified attackers blew up a school in the Birmal tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan in the late hours of Monday, the police said on Tuesday.
According to District Police Officer (DPO) South Waziristan Lower Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir, the explosion destroyed parts of the Government Middle School (GMS) Boys’ Sharif Khan Kot, including two classrooms, bathrooms, the main gate, and one side of the boundary wall.
Initial reports confirmed no casualties were reported.
The blast was so powerful that it was heard in distant areas. According to police sources, nearby houses were also affected. Solar panels, walls, and windows sustained partial damage from the blast.
Following the explosion, police launched an investigation into the incident and began collecting evidence from the site.
Local authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring the safety of educational institutions and maintaining peace in the region.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi strongly condemned the incident. In his statement, the governor said that those responsible for targeting an educational institution in South Waziristan are enemies of knowledge, development, and the younger generation.
He added that the entire nation stands with the state and its institutions to thwart the malicious designs of Fitna al-Khawarij.
The governor further stated that such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the nation’s resolve. Instead, these acts would only strengthen national unity against forces seeking to disrupt peace and progress, he said.
In December, 2025, terrorists blew up a government primary school in the Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan district, spreading fear and anxiety among students.
According to police, the incident occurred in Eppi village, where unknown assailants planted explosive material inside the building of the government girls’ primary school during the night, triggering a powerful blast that destroyed the structure.</p><small>2026-02-24 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2413373047732cb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975410/iranian-military-helicopter-crashes-into-fruit-market-4-dead-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian military helicopter crashes into fruit market, 4 dead: state media</strong></a><br><p>An Iranian Army helicopter crashed into a fruit market in the central province of Isfahan on Tuesday, killing the pilot, co-pilot and two merchants, state media reported.

It should not be possible for the villagers to beat the British — it is not their sport to begin with, and so the team of uninitiated villagers they assemble is haphazard, the equipment they use is makeshift.
They had some tricks up their sleeve though — the type of craftsmanship in sport that can only truly be borne by people who haven’t been indoctrinated by the rules. An enigmatic captain, a mystery spinner in Kachra whose bowling action kept the British confused.
But despite the zeal and the hours of training and the quirks of everyone involved, beating the British cavalry required a lot more than good cricket — it required not just this band of mismatched players to play out of their skins, but also for a certain level of divine intervention for things to go right.
First-timers?
Pakistan’s showing against India on the 15th of February was abysmal. The disparity when it comes to skill between the two sides, while not insurmountable, is still sizeable — so much so that Pakistan needed to be a livewire buzzing at a 100 per cent if they wanted to compete at any substantial level. Which they did not do.
It is disingenuous to compare Pakistan to a band of people playing cricket for the first time, even if the opposition was, fittingly, a side with both superior skill and institutional leverage. But at points, it did feel like the team that showed up to play against India was playing the sport for the first time.
When you know a side is better than you, you need to do absolutely everything right. Pakistan did not. The bowling was wayward and inconsistent, even from the likes of Abrar Ahmed, who are less susceptible to the waywardness than others. And even though fans have come to expect the batting to be as predictably fragile as it was, the state of affairs against India was particularly bad.

(It should be noted that like the team of villagers, Pakistan did have a mystery spinner that batters typically struggle to read, but the ‘outperforming expectations’ comparison ends here).
In the team’s defence, Pakistan’s loss against India was massive and discouraging, but it wasn’t all-conclusive. A win against Namibia — which did end up coming — would secure them a spot in the next round, which it did.
Pakistan beat Namibia by over a 100 runs, riding on the back of a clinical century by Sahibzada Farhan, making him only the second Pakistani to score one in a Men’s T20 World Cup. The bowling was sufficiently potent as well, with Usman Tariq claiming four wickets in a fielding effort that bundled the opposition out at a double digits score.
The Namibia match, however, while sufficiently convincing, made one thing clear — that the Pakistan cricket team might still be operating as a mix-and-matched unit well into the tournament.
The shuffle
Pakistan’s XI against Namibia had a gaping Abrar Ahmed shaped hole. While his figures in the match against India were a dismal wicketless 38 runs conceded in his three overs, it is important to note that out of all unfortunate performances in the India match, his was the most anomalous. Since the start of 2025, Abrar has averaged 18 with the ball in T20 international cricket, with standout performances in the Asia Cup and the series preceding the World Cup.
The matter of Babar Azam’s batting position was also one of the match’s major talking points, with him being moved down the order and eventually not needing to bat, as Pakistan put up a score of 199-3.
“I think Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the power play in the World Cup is less than 100 and that’s clearly not the role we think we need,” said coach Mike Hesson after Pakistan’s final practice session before the team’s first Super 8 fixture was washed out last Friday. According to his explanation, the situation the team found themselves in didn’t warrant the specific (anchoring, conservative) role that Babar finds himself in the team to fulfill.

Pakistan’s first Super 8 fixture against New Zealand fell victim to Colombo’s rain (as has much of Pakistan cricket, in retrospect).
What was concerning about the match that was not, however, was that Pakistan’s pre-game decision-making was questionable at best.
Decisions, decisions
Abrar was not brought back into the side, dispelling the possibility that his exclusion in the playing XI against Namibia was possibly to rest or rotate him, and that it was potentially a performance-based decision for his bad showing against India. This does not bode particularly well for the management, as it could be seen as a possible overreaction to a bad day from a bowler who has generally, for all intents and purposes, been excellent.
Another change that Pakistan made in the XI was to bring in Fakhar Zaman for Khawaja Nafay, who got his World Cup debut against Namibia, falling for a pedestrian 5 runs off 5 balls that did not necessarily sustain the promise of the glorious backfoot punch for 4 that he began his innings with.
While this Pakistan side under Salman Ali Agha’s captaincy and Hesson’s management has been more proactive tactically than its predecessors, this indecisiveness and the nature of these decisions makes one wonder how much confidence is inspired in the players through them.

 

Added to these was Pakistan’s decision to bat first at the toss, a questionable one considering the fact it is usually a wiser decision to opt to chase in a potential rain-affected game, keeping in mind possible DLS equations. Thankfully, to Pakistan’s benefit, the team drew a possible get-out-of-jail card with the match being washed out, and the consequences of what could have proven to be selection blunders never manifested.
Of course, it should be said that all of this critique comes from the vantage point of the viewer and fan — people who can never be fully sure of a team’s motives and working logics when it comes to strategy and tact. It is entirely possible that the choices made before the match would have been successful during it, should it have happened.
It is always a good idea for a fan to trust the process when it comes to supporting their team in an international tournament, mostly because a World Cup signifies a phase in a team’s metamorphosis where there isn’t much room for interpretation. At that point, all a team has to do is win, and all a fan has to do is watch.
The uncertainty of it all
That being said, what is unsettling about Pakistan’s run of form as they gear up to face England today, in what will hopefully be their first unblemished Super 8 Fixture, is the tepid sense of uncertainty that has threaded through it.
There is speculation that an out-of-form Shaheen Shah Afridi might be replacing the in-form Salman Mirza, or maybe even the phenomenal Usman Tariq. There are passionate calls for Babar to be replaced by Nafay, and the fact that Naseem Shah is yet to play a game in this tournament is not forgotten by fans, and neither are the two unconvincing toss decisions against India and New Zealand.
One might thus be compelled to compare Pakistan to at least a video game character that has made it this far in the game partially through skill but partially through hacking and bypassing the system, if not to a group of untrained villagers organising to defeat their colonial superiors.
But as Pakistan gears up to face the actual, 21st century British team, there are no cheat-codes to revert to at this level of the tournament. No shortcuts or calculations that could see Pakistan home. With a possible point lost to a wash-out already, Pakistan’s remaining fixtures are must-wins. If Pakistan wants to mix things up at this level, it must make sure that they subsequently match.

The Beechcraft C90 plane, operated by Redbird Airways, took off from state capital Ranchi but requested a change to its flight path due to weather, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Monday.
The aircraft subsequently lost communication and radar contact, the regulator said.
Rescue and medical teams rushed to the site of the crash, which local media said was deep inside a difficult-to-access forest.
“The team of doctors found them, and declared them dead,” local administrative official Keerthishree G told reporters, adding that two of the seven people killed were crew members.
“We have pulled out the bodies and sent them for post-mortem and further investigation,” the official said.
Keerthishree G is the deputy commissioner of Chatra district, where the crash occurred during a thunderstorm.
A team from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has been dispatched to investigate the cause, the regulator said.
Most air crashes are due to a combination of factors and can take at least a year to investigate, according to industry experts.
Relatives of the patient, Sanjay Kumar, told reporters he was injured in a fire and was initially undergoing treatment in Ranchi.
“His condition had become worse so we were taking him to Delhi by air ambulance,” said Vijay Sau, his older brother.
Last month, a Learjet 45 charter aircraft crashed killing all five people on board, including the deputy chief minister of India’s wealthiest state of Maharashtra and two members of his staff.

Thousands of party elites have packed the capital Pyongyang for a once-in-five-years summit of the ruling Workers’ Party, a gathering that directs state efforts on everything from diplomacy to war planning.
Kim Yo Jong — long considered one of her brother’s closest lieutenants — was promoted to department director within the party’s apex central committee, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Although it was not clear which department she would lead, she has previously held a senior role within the party’s propaganda unit.







Kim Yo Jong has in recent years emerged as one of the most powerful figures in North Korea, playing a highly visible role in diplomacy, nuclear negotiations and other matters of state.
“Kim Yo Jong is one of the very few people Kim Jong Un can trust and rely on,” said Ahn Chan-il, a researcher originally from North Korea.
“She also served as a working-level official for Kim’s summits with Trump in Singapore and Hanoi. She is experienced and seasoned,” he told AFP.

 

Kim Yo Jong burst on to the international scene in 2018, when she was dispatched to Seoul as North Korea’s envoy for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
With that trip, she became one of the first members of the ruling Kim dynasty to set foot in the South since the Korean War.
Since then she has gained a reputation for her vitriolic denunciations of Washington and Seoul.
She once derided the government of former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol as a “faithful dog” of the United States.
Her tone has softened somewhat since South Korea’s incumbent leader Lee Jae Myung — who has sought to mend ties with the North — took office last year.
Kim Yo Jong’s latest advancement “amounts to promotion to ministerial rank,” said Lim Eul-chul from the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University.
Rapid rise
Remarkably little is known about Kim Yo Jong given her prominent role in North Korea’s dealings with the outside world.
Born in 1988, according to the South Korean government, she is one of three children born to Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.
She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.
Pyongyang has never officially disclosed any information about Kim Yo Jong’s marital status or children.
Rare footage released by state media last year showed her attending an art show with two young children.

The Workers’ Party congress offers a rare glimpse into the political workings of reclusive North Korea, and is widely seen as a forum for Kim to flex his grip on power.
It is just the ninth time the gathering has been called to order under North Korea’s decades-spanning Kim dynasty.
There is keen interest in whether the congress might also promote leader Kim Jong Un’s teenage daughter Kim Ju Ae.
Kim Ju Ae has emerged as a clear frontrunner to continue the family dynasty, according to South Korea’s national intelligence service.

 


United States President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim Jong Un during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was “100 per cent” open to a meeting.
But the North Korean leader has so far largely shunned efforts to resume top-level diplomatic dialogue.</p><small>2026-02-24 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241219200eaa689.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975403/uk-police-release-ex-envoy-peter-mandelson-on-bail-in-epstein-case' target='_blank'><strong>UK police release ex-envoy Peter Mandelson on bail in Epstein case</strong></a><br><p>London police released former ambassador Peter Mandelson on bail in the early hours of Tuesday, in a probe into his ties to disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein, only days after ex-prince Andrew was arrested.
Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics and the UK’s former envoy to Washington, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office around 17:00 GMT (10pm PKT) on Monday following allegations arising from the latest set of documents linked to Epstein.
“A 72-year-old man arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office has been released on bail pending further investigation,” the Metropolitan police said in a statement around nine hours after he was taken in to an unnamed London police station.
Images on UK television earlier appeared to show Mandelson, 72, being driven away from his north London home, accompanied by a man and a woman, after police raided his properties earlier this month.
The arrest came days after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles III’s younger brother, was detained on Thursday and released under investigation in a separate misconduct in public office investigation also related to the latest Epstein documents.

 

Mandelson is being probed over allegations that he sent sensitive documents to the late US sex offender when he was a government minister, including during the 2008 financial crash.
Police have not specified which documents are part of the probe.
The veteran ex-politician was sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as envoy to Washington in September when an earlier release of documents linked to Epstein showed the extent of their friendship.
But Mandelson’s appointment has unleashed a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row.
Starmer apologised to Epstein’s victims for appointing Mandelson, and accused the ex-envoy of lying about the extent of his ties to the financier during the vetting process for his Washington posting.
Pressure rising
Law firm Mishcon de Reya, representing Mandelson, said earlier this month that he “regrets, and will regret until his dying day, that he believed Epstein’s lies about his criminality”.
“Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019,” said the statement.
“He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.”
The government is to release tens of thousands of emails, messages and documents on Mandelson’s vetting procedure, which could ramp up the pressure on the prime minister and other senior ministers.
Government minister Darren Jones on Monday said the first set of documents relating to Mandelson’s appointment will be published in early March.
Starmer fought off calls to resign earlier this month after he admitted he knew about Mandelson’s ongoing friendship with Epstein — which seemed to continue after the financier was convicted of child prostitution in 2008.
Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this month.
The advisory firm he co-founded, Global Counsel, also approached bankruptcy last week as it stopped trading and appointed administrations in a bid to salvage some assets.
Several major clients, including Barclays, Tesco and English football’s Premier League, have cut ties with the firm in recent weeks, according to press reports.
Officers from the Met’s specialist crime team were deployed earlier this month to search two of his addresses, one in the western English county of Wiltshire and the other in London, according to the police.</p><small>2026-02-24 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241101181d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975354/govt-seeks-opposition-buy-in-for-fresh-democracy-pact' target='_blank'><strong>Govt seeks opposition buy-in for fresh ‘democracy pact’</strong></a><br><p>• Rana Sana urges opposition to rejoin parliamentary panels; seeks end to political confrontation, deadlock
• Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal
• Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation.
The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power.
This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial.
Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically.
He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process.
Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces.
To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers.
Imran’s health
In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder.
The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail.
Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law.
He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements.
‘Peaceful sit-in’
Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked.
He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him.
Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter.
He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion.
CrPC amendment
The upper house also passed some key legislation, including a landmark bill seeking to prevent the police from keeping individuals in custody without informing their family members.
The Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by PPP lawmaker Shahadat Awan sought to insert a new section, 59-A, to the Code of Criminal Procedure which read: “When a person is arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled to have a family member, friend or other person known to him (or likely to take an interest in his welfare) informed by the officer in charge of the police station about his arrest.” It read that a police officer not below the rank of the superintendent of police may authorise a delay only if he has reasonable grounds to believe that informing the named person will lead to interference.
As per the bill’s statement of objects and reasons, the new section aimed to stop the abuse of process by the police officials who, in many cases, keep the suspect in custody without a formal arrest. It also said that an amendment to Section 431 and the insertion of 431A aimed to provide legal heirs the right to contest a case on behalf of the deceased to remove any kind of stigma.
The house also passed a bill to include the Senate opposition leader in the National Security Council. This bill was moved by Shahadat Awan.

Dr Mehwish Hasnain was killed late on Sunday as she was going home after performing duty at the KDA hospital.
The police said they had registered an FIR against unidentified people for the murder.
The protesters blocked the KDA Road and demanded the immediate arrest of the killer. They also called for tight security for themselves.
The protesters insisted that Dr Mehwish was shot by an attendant whom she earlier asked to leave the space reserved for women patients.

DPO says three teams formed to arrest killer

Spokesman for the YDA’s provincial chapter Hafeez Orakzai said that the woman doctor left the hospital alone for home, considering the incident a minor one.
“When Dr Mehwish was shot multiple times by the same visitor outside the hospital, she died on the spot,” he said.
The spokesman said staff members had suspended all services at three major hospitals in the city, including KDA Hospital, Liaquat Women and Children’s Hospital and Dental Hospital, to protest the murder.
“Only emergency care will be provided to visitors until the killer is arrested,” he said.
However, the doctors resumed work at the emergency department at the request of district police officer Shahbaz Khan, to the relief of patients from Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu and Karak districts.
Mr Hafeez said that it was the second such incident in Kohat.
He insisted that hospital visitors often thrashed staff members in the emergency departments, wards and labs.
When contacted, the DPO revealed the formation of three teams to arrest the killer(s) and said that he supervised the operation.
The doctor’s funeral prayers were offered at Sava Lakh graveyard on Monday, with her colleagues and officials of civil and police administrations in attendance.
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Pakistan condemned the murder and insisted it was not an isolated incident.
“Repeated incidents of violence against women doctors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa point to systemic gaps in workplace safety, security enforcement and institutional accountability. Such acts endanger healthcare workers and undermine public confidence in essential medical services,” the society said in a statement.
It urged the government to ensure a transparent and time-bound investigation for early punishment of culprits, strict security measures at all public health centres and formulation of a policy on prevention of workplace violence in healthcare settings, with special focus on the protection of women health professionals.
“Violence justified under the guise of ego or so-called honour has no place in a lawful society.”
The society said authorities should ensure justice was delivered and meaningful staff protection was ensured.

Ducky Bhai appeared before the court along with his wife, Aroob Jatoi, and their legal counsel.
During the proceedings, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo ordered the restoration of Ducky Bhai’s previously frozen bank accounts. He also granted him limited permission to upload videos on his YouTube channel.
However, the magistrate directed that the YouTuber must not discuss the sub-judice matter on his channel.
The magistrate observed that the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) raised objections to 27 videos uploaded on the suspect’s channel.
He said those videos should not be deleted at this stage.
A technical witness from the NCCIA appeared before the court for his testimony, however, the agency’s prosecutor was absent.
Due to the prosecutor’s absence, the magistrate adjourned the hearing till March 11.
The NCCIA had registered a case against several YouTubers and TikTokers on charges of promoting gambling apps on their social media accounts.
The agency had arrested Rehman during August last. The Lahore High Court had released him on bail on Nov 24, 2025.
After his release on bail, the YouTuber had accused the NCCIA officials of subjecting him to physical torture and humiliation during the custody.

KARACHI: While turning down an application of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) seeking to become a party in the proceedings, the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission on Monday recorded the testimonies of the municipal commissioner and various other officials in the Gul Plaza inferno probe.
As per the terms of reference (ToR), the single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court noted that the party could not become an intervener in these proceedings.
However, it advised the lawyer for the MQM-P to submit the information through email after the counsel asserted that the party has knowledge of some crucial facts and circumstances pertaining to the devastating fire incident.
The commission recorded the statements of the municipal commissioner, two police officials, the Civil Defence director, the president of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), a representative of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and a journalist.

Justice Agha Faisal rules commission’s ToRs do not permit intervention; advises Muttahida to submit their information via email

At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Tariq Mansoor submitted that the MQM-P has filed an application to become an intervener in these proceedings as the party was willing to provide information and crucial facts to the commission about the deadly inferno.
Justice Agha observed that the application could not be entertained as the ToRs of the commission have not allowed anybody to become an intervener in such proceedings.
However, he asked the counsel for the MQM-P to provide the information/data, if any, to the commission through an email. The lawyer replied that the information/data has been emailed to the commission.
Thereafter, the senior party leader Dr Farooq Sattar, who was also present along with another senior party leader Nasreen Jalil during the proceedings, attempted to address the commission.
However, Justice Agha asked him that he was disturbing the proceedings, and the commission would hear him after the hearing.
Municipal commissioner Sumera Hussain deposed that the plot of the ill-fated building was leased out in 1883 to the East India Company for tram services, and later, the company had sold out the same to five individuals who had handed over to the land to one Anwar Ali in 1976, and he had sold the plot to a private firm, Jeneka Group in, 1983.
When the bench asked about the purpose of the lease, she replied that the relevant documents were silent about it.
She also testified that the fire brigade department was under the administrative control of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). Responding to another question of the commission about the training and performance of the fire crew, she said that there was always room for improvement as the fire brigade was facing a shortage of manpower and a request was also made to the government for the purchase of equipment.
The municipal commissioner further said that the audit of Gul Plaza was carried out and that some of its recommendations were implemented.
‘Civil Defence lacks manpower to inspect all buildings’
Civil Defence Director Abdul Hameed deposed that the deputy commissioner (DC) had formed a committee in 2023 about Gul Plaza, and the body had also made its recommendations.
About a query regarding the inspection of all buildings, he said that the Civil Defence has lacked manpower and resources, and therefore, inspection was carried out randomly on a yearly basis.
When the commission asked him whether any action was taken for not implementing the recommendations made during an audit in 2025 about Gul Plaza, he replied that the DC concerned and the controller of Civil Defence could tell about the punishment or fine.
The director was also unaware of the issuance of the safety certificate to the building in question and said that the district committee would be in a better position to answer such questions.
SSP-City Arif Aziz deposed that four of the 17 gates of the ill-fated building were opened when the fire erupted. He was of the view that the watchmen, hired by the association of the building, were managing these entrance points and all such points had to be opened after the blaze.
When the commission confronted him about the CCTV footage, he replied that apart from the basement, the CCTV record was destroyed in the fire.
The SSP also stated that, as per initial information, a child of a shopkeeper was playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly broke out, and it spread sharply as inflammable material was available in the building.
SSP Traffic Aijaz Ahmed informed the commission that the city’s traffic police have the strength of only 5,200 personnel, and traffic personnel were called in from the surrounding areas shortly after the incident to make way for fire tenders.
He said that there was some disturbance on the M. A. Jinnah Road as the work was underway on a project about the extension of the Green Line.
KCCI president Rehan Hanif deposed that 11 committees have been constituted to consider and confirm the claims of shopkeepers of Gul Plaza.

 

He said that there were over 1200 shops in the gutted building, and around 850 claims were received and out of them 786 were admitted, three were rejected and the remaining claims were still under consideration due to some disputes.
Mansoor Shaikh, an officer of SSGC, said that four gas connections were provided to Gul Plaza, including two commercial and one each industrial and domestic, as the industrial connection was cut off in November. He was of the view that there was a gas loadshedding in the building when the fire erupted.
Adjourning the hearing till Feb 25, the commission also handed over questionnaires to the police officers about investigation & evidence, coordination & accountability, traffic management & access and provision of required documents.
Sattar alleges KE illegally set up gas turbine in basement
Meanwhile, speaking at a press conference, Dr Sattar was of the view that K-Electric had illegally installed a gas turbine and cylinders in the basement of Gul Plaza, one of the busiest commercial centres of the city, turning the entire area into a pile of explosive and why the provincial government was silent on such grave violations.
He claimed that they have approached the judicial commission as the party has evidence against corruption of the provincial government, irregularities in the construction of Gul Plaza building and inordinate delay in putting out the fire.

The prosecutors at the Hague-based war crimes court have charged Duterte with three counts of murder as a crime against humanity, involving dozens of victims that accusers say were only a fraction of the real death toll in his clampdown on alleged drug users and criminals.
“Duterte’s so-called war on drugs resulted in the killings of thousands of civilians and many of these victims were children,” prosecutor Mame Niang said at the opening of pre-trial hearings meant to confirm charges.

 

“Mr Duterte must be held to account and this case should be confirmed for trial,” he said. Under the ICC rules, judges will have to confirm charges before the case can move to trial. Duterte served as president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and was arrested and taken to The Hague last March.
According to the prosecutors, Duterte created, funded and armed death squads to target and kill alleged narcotics peddlers and users. Duterte has long insisted he instructed police to kill only in self-defence and has always defended the crackdown.



“Mr Duterte played a pivotal role in the committing of the charged crimes. His contribution was essential, as he was at the very heart of the plan to neutralise alleged criminals including through murder,” Niang said.
Opponents of Duterte gathered outside the court building, chanting “Hold Duterte accountable!” in Tagalog. “I hope, and I am quite confident, that the charges of murder and attempted murder will be confirmed” and Duterte’s guilt ultimately proven, Cristina Palabay, a worker at the human rights alliance Karapatan, said outside court. Duterte, 80, will not be present at the hearings, as his defence said he would not be able to understand proceedings due to his cognitive decline.
“For us, it’s cowardice,” said Sheerah Escudero, whose brother was killed during the war on drugs. “We know that Duterte will not be able to escape accountability.” After the hearings conclude on Friday, judges will take up to 60 days to decide if there is sufficient evidence to move the case to a trial.
‘High value targets’
Duterte faces three counts of crimes against humanity, with prosecutors alleging his involvement in at least 76 murders between 2013 and 2018. The true number of killings during his campaign in the Philippines is thought to be in the thousands, and lawyers for the victims have argued that a full trial could encourage more families to come forward.
Niang said the murders charges were “merely a fraction” of the real numbers killed.
Another prosecutor, Julian Nicholls, said: “The evidence shows… that Mr Duterte murdered thousands of his own people, Filippino men, women, and children.” Showing multiple videos of Duterte threatening to kill criminals, Nicholls said: “He repeatedly promised to kill people. He said it. He did it. That is who he is.” Duterte, who was president from 2016 to 2022, was arrested in Manila in March last year, flown to the Netherlands and has since been held at the ICC’s detention unit at Scheveningen Prison.

“Any country that wants to ‘play games’ with the ridiculous supreme court decision, especially those that have ‘Ripped Off’ the US for years, and even decades, will be met with a much higher tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to,” Trump posted on social media.







However, China urged the United States to cancel the ‘unilateral’ tariffs announced by President Trump after the US Supreme Court struck down the oft-trumpted tariff measures on imports.
China’s commerce ministry said it was conducting a “comprehensive assessment” of the ruling’s impact, and called on Washington to lift the tariffs.

China urges US to cancel unilateral measures, warning that ‘there are no winners in a trade war’

“China urges the US to cancel its unilateral tariff measures on its trading partners,” the ministry said, reminding the US that there were no winners in a trade war and that “protectionism leads nowhere.”
EU plans to freeze trade deal
EU lawmakers said they would put on hold a key trade deal with the United States after the SC struck down many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
European Parliament negotiators will meet to formally agree to freeze plans to approve the deal agreed last year.
The parliament’s trade committee had been due to give its green light on Tuesday to remove tariffs on US industrial goods as part of the accord.

GENEVA: The United Nations Secretary General on Monday called for a renewed international security architecture in response to a rapidly shifting global order.
“We are living through a period of chaos and change…The international order that defined security relations for nearly eight decades is shifting rapidly,” said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
“Moving forward, we need to create a renewed international security architecture. This needs to be based on sober analysis of the international situation,” he added.
“Human rights are under a full-scale attack around the world,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s annual session in Geneva.
“The rule of law is being outmuscled by the rule of force.” The UN secretary-general stressed that “this assault is not coming from the shadows, or by surprise. It is happening in plain sight — and often led by those who hold the greatest power”.
He did not mention specific situations, although he did voice outrage at Russia’s war in Ukraine, where he said more than 15,000 civilians had been killed in four years of violence.
“It is more than past time to end the bloodshed,” he said.
Guterres also highlighted the “blatant violations of human rights, hum­an dignity and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
He charged that the trajectory in the conflict-torn territories under Israeli occupation was “stark, clear and purposeful: the two-state solution is being stripped away in broad daylight”. “The international community can­­not allow it to happen,” he insisted.
Rights attacked ‘deliberately’
In his final in-person address to the UN’s top rights body, Guterres said the worst conflict-hit areas were not the only places where rights were eroding.
“We are living in a world where mass suffering is excused away, where humans are used as bargaining chips, where international law is treated as a mere inconvenience.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed the concerns.
In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”.
“A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.”
Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”.
“They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

RAWALPINDI / GILGIT: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday warned that rising temperatures might accelerate glacier melt and increase the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in northern areas of the country.
According to the Met Office, rainfall and snowfall in northern Pakistan remained below normal during the winter season, consistent with the seasonal forecast issued by the PMD.
“Reduced precipitation and persistent clear-sky conditions have resulted in stable atmospheric patterns and significantly elevated temperatures across Gilgit-Baltistan during the first two decades (Feb 1-22) of February 2026,” it stated.
Daytime (maximum) temperatures were recorded 3-5°C above normal, while night-time (minimum) temperatures remained 1-3.5°C above the 1981-2010 climatological average.
The highest warming has been observed in Gilgit and Bunji, while Chilas and Bunji have shown notable increases in minimum temperatures, reducing overnight refreezing.

 

The sustained above-normal temperatures are accelerating snow and glacier melt, particularly at mid to lower altitudes. Reduced night-time cooling further enhances meltwater runoff into glacial lakes. Rapid melting increases water accumulation in both moraine- and glacier-dammed lakes, raising the likelihood of Glof events in downstream valleys.
Feb-April outlook
The PMD’s outlook for Febr­uary-April 2026 indicates a high probability of above-normal temperatures over northern Pakistan, including GB and Kashmir. If this warming trend persists, the risk of accelerated glacier melt and potential GLOF occurrences may increase in vulnerable areas such as Gilgit, Ghizar, Hunza, Bunji, Chilas and Astore.
The department said it would continue to closely monitor temperature trends, glacier melt conditions and hydrometeorological parameters, and issue timely advisories to relevant authorities and communities.
From Feb 1 to 22, the PMD stated that the average temperature in Astore was recorded at 4.3°C, with a minimum of 1.3°C; Bunji at 4.5°C, with a minimum of 2.6°C; Chilas at 4.1°C, with a minimum of 3.4°C; Gilgit at 4.7°C, with a minimum of 2°C; Gupis at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.6°C; and Skardu at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.8°C.
‘Changing pattern’
Experts in Gilgit-Baltistan said that over the past three years, snowfall in the region had started later, with many areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual. Snowfall was received in late January this year, raising concerns about flooding in the summer.
According to Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain, the region’s fragile ecosystem is being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation. He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chances of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Rapidly melting glaciers, Glofs and cloudburst incidents severely affected residents of GB last summer. Experts said residents of the region, particularly those living downstream of rivers and glacial lakes, faced serious threats this summer.
Locals said snowfall usually began in late November. They added that temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
According to the GBEPA, the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6°C between 1987 and 2013. The region has faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Monday issued a detailed 116-page judgement on the removal of one of its judges, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, declaring that his appointment to the bench was “without lawful authority” as he did not possess a valid law degree.
An IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muha­mmad Azam Khan held that ex-Justice Jahangiri’s foundational law degree was void ab initio, rendering his elevation to the high court a “legal nullity”.
The judgement relied heavily on original academic records produced by the University of Karachi (KU) registrar, concluding that the respondent’s academic credentials were tainted by fraud, impersonation and a deliberate attempt to circumvent a disciplinary ban.
According to the verdict, Mr Jahangiri first appe­ared in his LL.B. Part-I examination in 1988 under a fake enrolment number. He was later caught using un­f­air means and was debarred for three years thro­u­gh a university disqualification circular issued in 1989.
Instead of complying with the ban, the court held, he “chose a course of deliberate misrepresentation” and reappeared in the 1990 examinations under a different identity — “Tariq Jahangiri” — using an enrolment number originally issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmad. He later appeared in the LL.B. Part-II examinations under his actual name but with yet another enrolment number.
Quoting the KU Controller of Examinations, the bench observed that a university issues only one enrolment number per programme and that it was “impossible” for a student to be allotted two numbers for the same degree. Consequently, the mark sheets and degree were declared invalid.
The principal of Government Islamia Law College also informed the court that Mr Jahangiri “was never admitted” to the institution — a claim the bench described as particularly damaging. Invoking the settled principle that what is void from the outset cannot be validated by subsequent administrative acts, the court declared the judge’s LL.B. degree a nullity in the eyes of law.
A key aspect of the judgement was the court’s criticism of Mr Jahangiri’s conduct during proceedings. Despite being granted repeated opportunities to submit a written reply and produce original documents, he failed to do so.
Instead, he filed applications seeking the constitution of a full court, recusal of the chief justice and adjournment sine die on the ground that related proceedings were pending before the Sindh High Court.
The bench termed these moves “dilatory tactics” and held that once prima facie documentary evidence had been produced by the petitioner, the burden shifted to the respondent to establish his lawful qualification. His failure to produce primary evidence, the court ruled, warranted an adverse inference.
Mr Jahangiri’s plea seeking recusal of Justice Dogar — on the basis that he had earlier challenged the chief justice’s transfer — was rejected.
The bench held that mere apprehension of bias was insufficient and reiterated that the constitution of benches was the sole prerogative of the chief justice.

 

It further described the attempt to exclude certain judges while implicitly favouring others as a “classic textbook manifestation of mala fide and bench-hunting”.
Addressing the question of maintainability, the IHC relied on a precedent of the Supreme Court in Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan, holding that the constitutional bar under Article 199(5) applies to judicial acts of a judge, not to questions relating to personal qualifications.
The bench clarified that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under Article 209 pertains to misconduct or incapacity during tenure and does not extend to determining whether an appointment itself was void from inception. “The SJC cannot cure a void appointment,” the court observed.
The appeal
The plea challenging ex-judge Jahangiri’s degree had been filed by lawyer Mian Dawood and was declared maintainable by the same division bench on Dec 9, 2025. Mr Jahangiri has already challenged both the maintainability order and subsequent proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
In his appeal, the former judge had contended that the IHC’s order declaring the petition maintainable, a Sept 16 order restraining him from performing judicial work, and what he termed the “unnecessary haste” of the division bench reflected bias, particularly on the part of the chief justice.
The appeal had stated that when the case was heard on Dec 2, 2025 and adjourned till Dec 9, no notice had been issued to him.
However, the Dec 2 ruling recorded the presence of two advocates as his counsel.
Mr Jahangiri had argued that the maintainability question — framed as one relating to “eligibility” rather than “conduct” — had been decided without issuing notice to him, thereby violating his fundamental right to due process and fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution.
He had contended that KU’s declaration cancelling his degree on Sept 25 had been suspended through an Oct 3, 2025 order of the Sindh High Court — a fact he alleged was not properly disclosed before the IHC.
Terming the IHC order unconstitutional and unlawful, the appeal had maintained that disputed factual questions regarding the validity of a degree could not be decided in constitutional jurisdiction and instead required a full-fledged trial involving recording of evidence before a competent court.

The PPP and the MQM-P are once again engaging in their old tug of war over who ‘owns’ Karachi, using bombast to stake their claims. The Sindh Assembly last Saturday passed a resolution, tabled by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, to condemn “any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”. The resolution affirmed that Karachi shall “forever remain” an integral part of Sindh. The MQM leadership protested at the resolution during its passage, and convened especially to declare it an “attack on the federation”. “This [resolution] challenged Pakistan, its Constitution, its law and its state,” an MQM leader declared at the party’s press conference. It was remarkable that the leaders of the MQM’s component factions were able to come together on the matter, given the bitter infighting the party — whose years of rule in Karachi yielded little more than a few flyovers — has seen in recent months.
The truth is that the Constitution does provide a route to creating new provinces, but this requires the approval of two-thirds of the respective provincial assembly. There seems to be no appetite within the Sindh Assembly for such a move, and, therefore, it is inexplicable why the PPP brought the matter up and why the MQM has taken umbrage to it. The latter may simply be using the matter to prop up its sagging relevance, as it is wont to do, but the Sindh government, too, must acknowledge why the ‘Karachi province’ issue keeps raising its head. Despite being Pakistan’s largest and arguably most important commercial centre, Karachi these days does not hold a candle to the country’s second-largest city, Lahore. Karachi is terribly neglected and misgoverned in comparison to the Punjab capital, for which the Sindh government is rightly blamed. Those who claim ‘ownership’ of Karachi merely wish to see it freed of the malicious systems that have entrapped it in the cycle of poor governance and urban decay. A better solution for the city lies in the implementation of a more robust local government system, but here, too, the Sindh government deserves blame for preventing such a system from taking root. Karachi is, indeed, an inseparable part and the jewel of Sindh. It is a shame that it does not look the part.
