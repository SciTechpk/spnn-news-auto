<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a926a209c00.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935090/new-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>New provinces?</strong></a><br><p>OF late, there has been a rash of seminars, media discussions and loaded commentaries on the idea of increasing the number of provinces in Pakistan.
Some entities have proposed converting the existing 32 administrative divisions into provinces while another recommendation is to go back to the original 12 administrative divisions that existed in erstwhile West Pakistan at the time of independence.
The sweeping conclusion of these proposals is that practically all our governance problems will be resolved once we create more provinces. Although different political parties had been advocating for the creation of new provinces for various reasons in the past, the current proposals apparently seek a greater number of provinces to facilitate the devolution of authority and achieve administrative efficiency.
 
 

If the idea of these proposals is to generate a fresh national debate to see if a consensus can be developed on the question, there should be no quarrel with the intention, but the debate needs to be organic and not stoked or moulded by vested interests. The consensus-building process should not be hurried; an important but contentious question like the creation of new provinces should be debated and scrutinised on the basis of facts and figures, both inside parliament and outside.
Since the question of carving out new provinces from existing ones is a highly emotive one, there is a risk that the debate could result in outbursts. It is, therefore, important that the debate does not take place in a vacuum and a carefully prepared document, framing the key issues, forms the basis of the issue.
The timing of the debate is questionable. As we deal with the resurgence of terrorism, an ailing economy, which is just about showing signs of improvement and an explosive geopolitical situation, one wonders if the creation of new provinces should really be on our agenda.
The impetus for the debate may not be organic. There have been times in the past when strong and sometimes violent movements for separate provinces in south Punjab, the non-Pashto-speaking Hazara division and Sindh’s urban areas were active at different times, but at present there doesn’t seem to be such an active movement, probably because there are more critical issues which need to be tackled first.

Is creating new provinces the best way to achieve better governance?

In the ongoing discourse, India’s example of increasing its states from the original 17 provinces to the current 28 states is also cited. One should keep three points in mind, while comparing our situation to India’s. First, the impetus for the creation of new states in India came from fierce and, and at times violent, movements particularly in the south, which demanded states on the basis of language. These movements led to the formation of Linguistic Provinces Commission (Dhar Commission) in 1948.
The demand for language-based states had gained so much momentum by 1952 that an activist demanding a Telugu state died after a fast-unto death. This tragic incident provoked agitation across the country, with many linguistic groups demanding separate states. In today’s Pakistan, no such violent movement exists, although the demand for separate provinces for Sindh’s Urdu-speaking people, Seraiki speakers in various provinces and KP’s Hindko-speaking population has been raised from time to time. While Urdu is the national language, separate provinces already exist which are inhabited by the majority of speakers of regional languages, including Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto and Balochi.
 
 

The second distinction is that India is not a classic federal state. It is a ‘union’ which has certain characteristics of a federation. The change in the boundaries of the Indian states is therefore much simpler than is the case in Pakistan, which is a constitutionally declared federation. Altering provincial boundaries requires a two-third majority in the concerned provinces, before a constitutional amendment can be moved in the two Houses of Parliament, where again a two-third majority is needed in each to separately pass the constitutional amendment.
The third distinctive feature of the Indian quest for new provinces is important to note by the proponents of new provinces in Pakistan. India formed a States Reorganisation Commission in 1953 which worked on reorganisation proposals for 21 months and presented its report in 1955. The States Reorganisation Act was subsequently passed in 1956, incorporating most of the recommendations made by SRC. This act led to the creation of 14 states and three union territories. Subsequently, 14 additional states were gradually created from 1956 to the present.
In the context of today’s Pakistan, the real question is whether creating new provinces is really the most cost-effective and practical way to achieve the objective of better governance and devolution of powers. Apparently, the answer is in the negative.
Assuming that 12 provinces are to be created, each new province will come with a huge price tag as taxpayers will have to pay for eight new provincial assemblies, governors, chief ministers, cabinets, high courts, public service commissions, civil secretariats, to name a few, along with the necessary physical infrastructure, etc. Such extravagance is not acceptable in any case but in the present economic scenario it would be almost criminal. Securing a two-third majority in the assemblies will be next to impossible.
 
 

There is a much simpler option available for achieving the objective of devolution and administrative efficiency — making the local governments effective, while underwriting their continuity and funding through a constitutional amendment as India did 45 years after the passage of its constitution.
Large provinces are not so much an issue as the lack of devolution of powers to the local level. The UK is a unitary state but an empowered local government there has helped provide good governance and the decentralisation of powers. The way forward for devolution in Pakistan is, therefore, empowered local governments and not the tedious route of creating new provinces.

A factory worker, he took his usual route to work on Monday morning, but only made it back late on Tuesday night.
“My family was gasping out of dread. They were unable to reach me because my mobile fell in the water. A man walking a few steps ahead of me vanished. He either fell unconscious or was electrocuted. How can I ever forget that?” he said.
Frustrated by the plummeting quality of life in the country’s commercial hub, Hazim is now determined to leave the city and move his family to Lahore.
 
 

For him, and many others, the city that held the promise of turning dreams into reality now resembles a post-apocalyptic vision of the future.
In this week’s cosmic downpour, amid raging torrents that were its streets, sunken roads, fallen trees and buildings, and over 17 casualties, Karachi drowned in acute administrative apathy.
On that fateful day, Sharea Faisal — perhaps the country’s most ubiquitous main artery — was without a single rescue service in sight.
Hazim says he saw furious waves of water flip vehicles over, the current carrying the heavier ones till they crashed into something else. Meanwhile, social media was replete with videos of people ‘pickling’ in their submerged cars.
Rickshaws, SUVs, cranes; none escaped the water’s wrath and were swallowed whole by large pools forming in construction sites along the thoroughfare.

For Justin, an English expat living in Karachi, the deluge was the worst he had witnessed in his 20 years in Pakistan.
After driving across town from his DHA home to help those stranded in other parts, he too was in shock.
“I know that last year Dubai and Houston were flooded. The UK saw routine shutdowns during storms. But in those places, it seems that the failure is mechanical and temporary. Sadly, in Karachi it is systemic and permanent. The people’s strength is a testament to the human spirit.”
The hard rain also washed away all polite barriers of class. From swanky DHA and KDA to the tight lanes of Baldia Town, Orangi, Korangi, Saddar and other parts, everything from electricity poles to motorcyclists vanished in the brown, waist-high waters.
Saeed, a labourer in DHA, knew what was in store. “Another committee, more promises with no results. If this place is destroyed, then my area will never recover.”
Even hospitals were not spared; with videos of emergency rooms filled with ankle-deep water doing the rounds.
 
 

The fierce rainfall also unleashed a landslide at Kati Pahari — with huge boulders rolling down towards fragile settlements, reminiscent of the destruction wrought in the hilly parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Then, there were the throngs of poor women, drenched to the bone, lining the streets in knee-deep waters. These were the working women, making their way from the posh societies where they worked to homes in Qayyumabad, Korangi, Azam Basti and Akhtar Colony — each area a more sobering portrait than the last.
Ambareen and her husband saw their plight, took out their jeeps, packed eight to nine women in each vehicle — including an old lady with a deep gash from an overturned rickshaw — and made multiple trips to save almost 80 to 100 hapless Karachiites.
Fraught conversations along the way offered hurried sketches of their ordeal.
“We leave our homes to earn. Normally, the parlour drops us to the main road. But today, the driver dashed to save his little son who fell into a manhole in this rain. I have spent hours navigating these roads. You can imagine what I am going home to,” said Christina.

Sadaf, a maid, was angry: “I have walked for hours with a cut in my foot because my chappal fell apart. I have to reach Korangi dhai number. We are perpetually miserable because of these thieves.”
Alongside her sat a frail Khadija. “My rickshaw toppled into a ditch and my head is injured. How much can we weather! This Sindh government has never worked for us,” was her lament.
In a new era that brings its own kind of deluge, the battle between memory and money is more apparent than ever before in Karachi.
The rain will stop. The rage, after a long time, will stick like a bloodsucker, or loss.

“We are very confident that these relations are stable and sustainable on their own and will continue to grow and achieve new heights,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said during the weekly media briefing.
His remarks came a day after Chi­n­ese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Pakistan as part of his three-nation South Asian tour to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue.
While the Pak-China dialogue broadly reviewed various aspects of the bilateral relationship, both sides carefully navigated the region’s shifting geopolitical landscape marked by warming China-India ties, Pakistan’s growing engagement with the United States, and tensions in US-India relations driven by President Trump’s tariffs and policies.
 



FO terms New Delhi’s missile capabilities a global security threat

India’s leg of Yi’s visit strengthened China’s rapprochement with New Delhi after years of hostility. The visit resulted in agreements to resume suspended trade talks and accelerate negotiations on border disputes.
Speaking at a media conference following the bilateral dialogue, Yi had emphasised China’s partnerships with both India and Pakistan “were not targeted at any third party, nor were they affected by any third party.”
 
 

Both Yi and FM Ishaq Dar underlined the importance that Pakistan and China attach to each other. Yi described Islamabad as “the most important stop” on his three-nation trip and highlighted the “stronger internal drive” behind bilateral ties.
Echoing these sentiments, the FO spokesperson said: “Pakistan-China relationship is a very sustainable, longstanding, and robust relationship.” He expressed confidence that Pakistan-China relations, including their growing economic and strategic cooperation, would not be affected by regional developments, including those involving China.
Dialogue offer
Mr Khan said Pakistan is ready for an all-encompassing dialogue with India and welcomed the mediatory efforts of ‘friends’. “We are ready for composite dialogue. We welcome any effort which helps us achieve our objectives,” he remarked.
 
 

Although Wang Yi did not publicly comment on India-Pakistan tensions or offer to mediate, he said, “A peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia serves the common interests of all sides and meets the expectations of all peoples.”
Mr Dar, soon after Yi’s visit, signalled Pakistan’s readiness to engage in dialogue with India. The FO spokesman stressed that unlike India’s insistence on focusing solely on terrorism, Pakistan believes “this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
Pakistan was not reluctant to address terrorism, as “we have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan”, he said.
Agni-V test
The FO warned that India’s expanding missile capabilities pose a threat to both regional and global security and criticised the selective application of export control regulations by the Western countries that enabled New Delhi to advance its missile programme.
 
 

“The acquisition and testing of int­ercontinental ballistic missile capabilities reflects a growing military threat posed by India extending far beyond the region and even the continent. This development seriously undermines peace, security and strategic stability at both regional and global levels,” the spokesperson said.
“India’s expanding missile arsenal, including systems with intercontinental range, raises serious concerns about the selective and discriminatory application of Export Control Regulations that have enabled such destabilising advancements,” Mr Khan added.
Expressing concern over India’s accelerating arms buildup, Mr Khan warned: “It is dangerous not only for Pakistan’s security but also for regional stability.”

Recent cases indicate that traffic violations and campus protests may be reported to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), raising alarms among the Pakistani community.
Two Pakistani students in northern Virginia were shocked when a traffic court judge informed them that courts are now required to share records of traffic violations with DHS.
“We were planning to drive to Chicago, but we’ve been advised not to,” said Yunus Khan, a student from Baltimore, Maryland. “We are on visas and even a minor mistake could lead to revocation.”

US reviewing social media for anti-American or extremist content; Pakistani embassy says it’s monitoring the situation, advises caution in political activities

Students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, are even more anxious. “Some of us joined those demonstrations and now we don’t know if we can stay or might face deportation,” said Samina Ali, also from Baltimore.
 
 

Mohammad Sajid, a student at George Mason University, said, “Most of us work part-time to pay tuition. Now we don’t know whether we can continue working.”
Khalid, who attends a community college in northern Virginia, added, “Almost all foreign students are scared. We don’t know whether we can work, drive, or even go out. This is not the America that we dreamed of.”
Those living in the US under political asylum face even greater concerns.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington estimates that between 700,000 to a million Pakistanis live in the United States, most as citizens or long-term residents. Many do not register officially, so exact numbers are unclear.
According to the latest Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education, the United States hosted 1,126,690 international students in 2024, up 7 per cent from the previous year.
Pakistan sent 10,988 students in 2024, compared to 17,099 from Bangladesh and 16,742 from Nepal. India topped the list with 331,602 students.
The Pakistani embassy estimates that the number of Pakistani students has risen to about 12,500 in 2025, still far below other South Asian countries.
 
 

As part of the broader vetting process, US authorities are reviewing social media activity for any signs of hostility toward US citizens, culture, government, or institutions.
Officials have also been instructed to monitor for support of designated foreign terrorists or engagement in antisemitic harassment or violence.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, stated, “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies.”
In addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in the issuance of worker visas for truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the impact on American livelihoods.
Visa holders from Malawi and Zambia are now required to pay a $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas, while travel bans remain in effect for 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven more.
The crackdown has left Pakistani students and visa holders anxious about their future.
Pakistani authorities in Washington continue to receive queries from students and other visa holders and forward them to the US State Department. Embassy officials are closely monitoring the situation, emphasising the importance of legal documentation, awareness of rights, and caution in political activity.

The report, compiled by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP), said that under the law, the SECP must obtain approval from the Ministry of Finance for salary hikes. However, the SECP management proceeded with a pay raise for its employees during a Policy Board meeting on Oct 17, 2024, with effect from July 1, 2023.
The audit found that the salary package of SECP Chairman Akif Saeed reached Rs41.53m for the fiscal year 2023-24, while each commissioner received Rs35.8m due to the backdated salary increases. Additio­nally, the report revealed that SECP illegally distributed Rs110m for entertainment allowances to its commissioners and staff.
The AGP’s findings highlight that while the SECP Policy Board approved these raises, it lacked the authority to sanction such increases. Besides, the pay and allowance increases were made without prior approval from the finance division, totalling Rs377.22m.
The audit report urged the finance ministry to either approve or reverse these illegal increases.
 
 

The audit also highlighted that SECP had failed to deposit around Rs14 billion into the Federal Consolidated Fund, including Rs7.11bn in revenues. These funds were generated through licensing and registration fees (Rs4.13bn), the insurance sector (Rs591.56m), the securities market (Rs47.77m), and specialised companies (Rs1.91bn).
Under Section 37(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2019, all revenues collected by an autonomous entity under federal government statutory instruments must be deposited in the treasury single account. However, SECP did not comply with this requirement.
The SECP also failed to deposit a surplus balance of Rs6.99bn into the Federal Consolidated Fund, even though any surplus of receipts over actual expenditure must be remitted to the Fund.

The five-member panel, which met under the chairmanship of Justice Jamal  Khan Mandokhail, with a majority of three to two referred the  recommendations back to the JCP for perusal and final decision.
The subcommittee considered three agenda items: drafting criteria for judges’ selection for the constitutional benches, framing rules for performance evaluation of judges of all high courts, and considering rules for the service structure of JCP secretariat.
The service rules were approved by the subcommittee.

Justice Mandokhail-led subcommittee approves rules for service structure of JCP secretariat, defers framing of rules for performance evaluation of judges of all high courts

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Sena­tor Farooq H. Naek from the treasury, and representative of the Pakis­tan Bar Council (PBC) Mohammad Ahsan Bhoon opposed the proposal to develop criteria, whereas Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, on behalf of the opposition, highlighted the need for outlining such rules. Justice Mandokhail abstained, the source claimed.
 
 

On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee for judicial performance evaluation of high court judges.
It comprised members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and the legal fraternity, tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations as well as developing criteria for judges’ selection for the constitutional bench.
During the meeting, it was considered that Article 191A does not empower drafting rules for judges’ nomination for the constitutional benches, since all Supreme Court judges had been elevated from different high courts where they had exercised constitutional jurisdiction while hearing legal matters.
Filters may bar judges from full court
It was argued that if any filters were developed through such criteria, it would mean that judges who did not meet the standard would be excluded from sitting on the full court. This would particularly affect demands to enlarge the constitutional bench into a full court by including all available SC judges. In such a case, the constitutional bench could never become the full court, since some judges might not fulfil the yardstick, the source said. He added that if such judges could not sit on the full court, then questions would arise as to why they were included earlier when the full court decided constitutional matters such as the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
Meanwhile, the subcommittee deferred the agenda of framing rules for regulating performance evaluation of all high court judges, though it acknowledged that Article 175A (4) empowers the committee to develop fitness evaluation rules. The matter will be revisited in near future.
In June, the JCP in a majority decision extended the tenure of the SC constitutional bench till Nov 30, 2025.
Under the 26th Amendment, a seven-judge constitutional bench was initially formed on Nov 5, 2024 for a period of 60 days. The bench included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Moham­mad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
In December, its tenure was exte­nded for six months. In February, the constitutional bench was expanded to 13 members with the inclusion of Justices Hashim Khan Kakar, Salah­uddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq, and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.

• Over 330 households affected across six villages; no casualties reported
• Dozens of homes, acres of farmland, bridges and trees submerged
• GB CM orders immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) caused widespread devastation in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer Valley early on Friday mor­n­ing, but the quick thinking of a local shepherd helped avert a human tragedy.
According to Rescue 1122, the flood, triggered by a burst from a glacier in the Tildas village of Gupis Valley, occurred at around 3am, wreaking havoc downstream.
The flood debris blocked the Ghizer River for several hours, significantly raising the risk of further flooding in adjacent areas. Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Secretary Fida Hussain explained that a gla­cial lake had formed above Tildas and Rawshan villages. The high temperatures led to the burst of the lake, causing a flash flood in Sado Nallah on Wednesday night.
A shepherd, Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier, used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood. His warning gave villagers enough time to evacuate and local volunteers swiftly moved residents to safer locations.

Mr Hussain confirmed that although the flood swept through the downstream areas of Tildas and Rawshan, no casualties were reported. However, around 40 people were initially stranded in the floodwaters on Friday morning. The Pakistan Army was called for a helicopter rescue, but by the time the helicopters arrived, local volunteers had already managed to rescue the stranded individuals. All affected residents are reported to be safe.
Local sources said that the flood devastated approximately 80 per cent of Tildas village, displacing 65 households and washing away homes, land, infrastructure and personal belongings. The floodwaters also blocked the Ghizer River for six hours, creating an artificial lake and submerging homes, farmland, bridges and trees in nearby villages.
According to a local administration report, the flood affected over 330 households across six villages — Tildas, Raushan, Hakis, Gawat and Molaabad — after the river was blocked. The report highlights that of the 906 houses in these villages, 330 were severely damaged, leaving these families in dire need of emergency assistance.
Public infrastructure was also submerged, including a mosque, a school, a Jamat Khana and an RCC bridge on the Gilgit-Ghizer Road. The artificial lake on the Ghizer River submerged parts of the Gilgit-Shandur Road, cutting off access to the upper Gupis, Phander and Yasin regions.
 
 

According to Rescue 1122, some 200 people were rescued from the flood-affected areas and relocated to the Yangal and Samal areas of Ghizer. The rescue teams also provided medical assistance to those traumatised by the destruction of their homes.
Displaced families, who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, are now in urgent need of shelter, food and medical supplies. The local administration has said that while water has begun to recede from the artificial lake, the risk to downstream settlements persists.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and cabinet members visited the affected areas in Ghizer and announced the immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, including bridges, power supply lines, drinking water and irrigation channels.
The chief minister also directed the home secretary and the director general of the GB Disaster Management Authority to assist in the rescue efforts and ensure the safety of the affected populations.
In recognition of the heroic actions of the shepherd, Wasiyat Khan, the GB police department issued an official commendation certificate.
His timely alert saved several lives, and local communities and officials alike have hailed him as a hero.
Ghizer Valley has been severely affected by flooding this year. On Aug 14, the region was struck by multiple floods, resulting in 13 deaths, several injuries and widespread displacement across the Ghalti, Ishkoman, Gupis, Yasin, Daen and Chaturkhand areas.
These disasters occurred without early warning systems in place, which could have saved lives and property.

• Hunger monitor says similar conditions expected in Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis by next month
• Hamas demands opening of Gaza crossings after UN, IPC declaration
• Israel cries foul as world holds it responsible for ‘man-made’ calamity
ROME: The United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza City, the first time it has done so in the Middle East, with exp­­e­rts warning that over half a million people faced catastrophic hunger.
“It is a famine: the Gaza famine,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) panel found famine was now present in and around Gaza City.
He blamed Israel, accusing it of “systematic obstruction” of aid deliveries to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
 






Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the UN-backed report as “an outright lie”, while the foreign ministry insisted: “There is no famine in Gaza.”
The IPC defines famine as occurring when 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food; 30pc of children under five are acutely malnourished; and at least two in every 10,000 people die daily from outright starvation or from malnutrition and disease.
UN agencies have long been war­n­ing of the deteriorating huma­nita­rian situation in Gaza, particularly as Israel steps up its offensive in the besieged and war-torn enclave.
The Rome-based IPC said that “as of 15 August 2025, famine (IPC Phase 5) — with reasonable evidence — is confirmed in Gaza governorate”.
The UN estimates that nearly one million people currently live in the Gaza governorate.
 


It was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis by the end of next month.
The IPC previously concluded that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024.
A famine was projected in Yemen in 2018, but never officially confirmed, des­pite the humanitarian crisis in the country.
‘Man-made’
According to figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry, verified by the World Health Organisation, deaths from malnutrition and starvation are spiking.
In the first seven months of the year, 89 fatalities were attributed to malnutrition or starvation, mostly children and teens. Just in August, there have been at least 138 deaths, including 25 minors, the ministry said on Friday.
The IPC said the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made”, driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.
In early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.
“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he said.
UN rights chief Volker Turk said “it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare”.
 






UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access to Gaza, adding: “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”
The International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as “devastating and entirely foreseeable”.
“Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,” it said in a statement.
Outrage
Hamas called on Friday for an immediate end to the war in Gaza and the lifting of the Israeli siege on the territory.
In a statement published online, the group called for “immediate action by the UN and the security council to stop the war and lift the siege” and demanded that crossings be opened “without restrictions to allow the urgent and continuous entry of food, medicine, water and fuel”.
It said the declaration by the UN confirmed the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza — but lamented that it came far too late.
Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday condemned the famine in Gaza as a “moral outrage” and a “man-made catastrophe”.
Calling it “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable”, he called on Israel to take urgent action to remedy the situation.
 






“We are seeing the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe that we can even measure,” said Jeanette Bailey, a child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid organisation.
‘Too weak to cry’
In July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.
“The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,” said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell.
 






The local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98pc of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said.
Meanwhile, livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.
The IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.

“Although it was a natural catastrophe, there is no room for man-made disaster,” the prime minister said while addressing the federal cabinet meeting.
“For how long the federal and provincial governments continue to pay compensation for the loss of lives caused by illegal constructions along rivers and water channels,” the prime minister asked.
He revealed that more than 700 people have lost their lives during rains and flooding in the country, of which over 400 deaths occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

PM to convene meeting with provinces; committee of ministers will work to reduce agriculture production costs

“I will soon convene a meeting on the issue of illegal constructions such as hotels, restaurants and houses, as monsoon rains have caused catastrophic floods in northern parts of the country,” he added.
Record rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which began on Aug 15, have wreaked havoc across different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains destroyed homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction in Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and other areas.
The PM expressed concern over such structures, which reflected “catastrophic beauty”, and also over deforestation in Galiyat, where plazas and houses have been built.
 
 

The PM reviewed the relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected areas during the meeting, saying that the federal government had exte­nded “full cooperation” to the provincial governments.
He also commended the efforts of the armed forces in rescue and relief operations. “Pakistan Army reached the distant and difficult areas to rescue the people. For this purpose, helicopters were also used,” he said.
He mentioned his visit to the flood-affected areas in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, highlighting the efforts of ministers and secretaries. “This is a collective responsibility,” he added.
Following the disaster, he said, the responsibility of the Ministry of Climate Change has increased to deal with the challenges of climate change. He added that other relevant departments will also have to play their part.
The PM also referred to the recent “destructive rains” in Karachi earlier this week. “I spoke to the Sindh chief minister and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to express my sympathies,” he said.
Ministerial committee formed
Later, PM Shehbaz formed a ministerial committee with a task to reduce production cost of agriculture.
The cabinet also approved the closure of Utility Stores across the country with effect from July 1. The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to protect the rights of the stores’ workers.
In a separate decision, the cabinet approved the proposed amendments to the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 2012.
PM Shehbaz stressed that providing a business and investor-friendly environment was crucial for industrial development, adding that the expansion of industries would enhance exports and create new jobs.
The meeting also approved the presentation of the Annual Report of the National Economic Council for fiscal year 2023-24 before Parliament, and endorsed decisions taken by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Aug 19 and the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases (CCLC) on August 18.
On Wednesday, the prime minister visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner, and Shangla in KP, where 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori area.
While interacting with flood victims, he assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support “in this critical hour.”
The KP government, on Monday, released Rs800 million in relief funds for all affected districts, with an additional Rs500m specifically for the worst-hit Buner, as flash floods continue to ravage the province with over 400 deaths.

In a column published on Aug 16, Warraich — a senior editor at the Jang newspaper — wrote that COAS Munir had spoken to him during a stopover in Brussels, on his way back from a recent trip to the US. “On a question about politics, he (the army chief) said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read, without specifying who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about. However, that quote ended up stirring a controversy in the commentariat.
Challenging the impression that the army chief had “sought an apology over the May 9 riots”, the military’s spokesperson had said on Thursday that Field Marshal Munir did not make any political statements during a recent trip to Brussels. He had also rebuked the senior journalist in remarks carried by state-run Radio Pakistan.
In his first public comment on the situation since then, Warraich issued a statement on X today. It must be pointed out that, when approached for a comment following the DG ISPR’s clarification, Warraich had declined to make one.
On Friday, he said that while he had respect for Lieutenant-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, “the points he (Chaudhry) refuted were never mentioned in my column. Perhaps he spoke based on a misunderstanding.”
Warraich said that he was ready to offer further clarification if there were any further questions.
He said the Inter-Services Public Relations director general had firmly said that the army chief had given no interview. To this, he responded: “Please reread my entire column — nowhere does it use the word ‘interview’. The title of my column is simply ‘First Meeting’, neither more nor less. I never wrote it was a one-on-one meeting.”
Warraich said it was “absolutely correct” that no discussion had taken place about the May 9 riots or PTI founder Imran Khan, adding: “Kindly reread the column; it contains no mention of May 9, Imran Khan or his apology. I wrote only one sentence: that regarding political reconciliation, he (the army chief) cited verses of the Holy Quran and their translation. What impression people or trolls drew from it is their prerogative.”
He said the points refuted “on such a large scale” were not even a part of his column. “If they’re in someone’s mind then it depends entirely on their choice,” Warraich added.
 






Regarding the criticism he received from various quarters, he said there was no need for a response.
“The coming time and the history to be written will clarify every matter. I have always avoided fights and arguments in life and even after much thought, my opinion remains the same.”
Concluding his statement, he said the bits he had written about in his column were but a “fragment” of the army chief’s address and whatever interpretation one wanted to take from them was their wish.
“Those who poke their noses in my column are making arbitrary interpretations and artificial interpretations to achieve their own goals and interests. As time goes on, everyone’s true nature will be revealed. History is the only source that exposes false claims, fake truths and so-called allegations. History will decide in favour of journalism.”</p><small>2025-08-22 19:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22231926dda1b16.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934496/russia-rejects-zelensky-meeting-as-diplomatic-tension-simmers' target='_blank'><strong>Russia rejects Zelensky meeting as diplomatic tension simmers</strong></a><br><p>Russia on Friday ruled out an immediate meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as diplomatic tension with him escalated and US mediation efforts appeared to stall.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said “no meeting” between President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky was planned, as Nato chief Mark Rutte visited Kyiv, largely to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.
United States President Donald Trump had raised expectations for a swift summit between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents by saying earlier in the week they had agreed to meet, but on Friday compared the two men to “oil and vinegar”.
“They don’t get along too well, for obvious reasons,” he told reporters in Washington.
 


Lavrov also poured cold water on hopes for direct Putin-Zelensky talks to resolve the conflict, now in its fourth year, by questioning the Ukrainian president’s legitimacy and repeating the Kremlin’s maximalist claims.
“There is no meeting planned,” Lavrov said in an interview with NBC’s ‘Meet the Press with Kristen Welker’.
Lavrov told the US broadcaster Putin was “ready to meet Zelensky” as soon as an agenda was prepared, adding that the agenda was “not ready at all”.
 


In Kyiv, speaking alongside Rutte, Zelensky said Ukraine had “no agreements with the Russians”, saying Ukraine had agreed only with Trump on how the diplomatic direction could proceed.
On Thursday, he had accused Russia of “trying to wriggle out of holding a meeting”, adding that Moscow wanted to continue the offensive.
‘A utopia’
The question of eventual security guarantees for Ukraine has been front and centre during the latest US-led diplomatic push to broker a peace deal to end the conflict.
Trump earlier said Russia had agreed to some Western security guarantees for Kyiv. But Moscow later cast doubt on any such arrangement, Lavrov saying on Wednesday that discussing them without Russia was “a utopia, a road to nowhere”.
“When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, I honestly do not yet know who is threatening them,” said Zelensky, who wants foreign troops in Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the future.
The Kremlin has long said it would never accept that, citing Ukraine’s Nato ambition as one of the pretexts for its assault.
“There are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no Nato membership, including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelensky said no to everything,” Lavrov told NBC.
On a visit to Kyiv, during which an air raid alert sounded across the city, Rutte said security guarantees were needed to ensure “Russia will uphold any deal and will never ever again attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine”.

Moscow signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994, which was aimed at ensuring security for Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan in exchange for them giving up numerous nuclear weapons left from the Soviet era.
Russia violated that first by taking Crimea in 2014, and then by starting a full-scale offensive in 2022, which has killed tens of thousands of people and forced millions to flee their homes.
Trump may ‘do nothing’ if Putin, Zelensky fail to meet
Trump said on Friday he would make an “important” decision in two weeks on Ukraine peace efforts, specifying that Moscow could face massive sanctions or he might do nothing.
Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he was “not happy” about a Russian strike on Thursday that hit a US-owned factory in Ukraine, and “I’m not happy about anything having to do with that war.” But he said he wanted to see whether Putin and Zelensky would meet first.
 


“I think I’ll know. I think I’ll know the attitude of Russia, and, frankly, of Ukraine. It takes two,” Trump said when asked what he would do at the end of a two-week timeframe he set for assessing the state of peace talks.
“Then I’m going to make a decision as to what we do and it’s going to be a very important decision,” he said. “That’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both. Or do we do nothing and say it’s your fight.”</p><small>2025-08-22 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22145559bd6df4d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933967/aleema-khans-other-son-shershah-also-arrested-from-lahore-home-over-alleged-involvement-in-may-9-riots' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema Khan’s other son Shershah also arrested from Lahore home over alleged involvement in May 9 riots</strong></a><br><p>Lahore Police on Friday confirmed that another son of Aleema Khan, sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, was taken into custody from his Lahore residence, a day after his brother was arrested in connection with the May 9 riots.
The deputy investigation of Lahore Police confirmed to Dawn.com that Shershah Khan, akin to his brother Shahrez Khan, was also arrested today for his involvement in the May 9 riots.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir Umar, said that “Shershah was taken from his house after his appearance at a Lahore anti-terrorism court in relation to his brother’s case”.
The PTI, in a post on X, called the incident an “abduction” and lamented that “the rule of law has been replaced with the law of the jungle”.
The move comes a day after PTI announced that men in plainclothes had “abducted” Aleema’s son from her residence. Lahore police later announced that Shahrez had been arrested in connection with a May 9 case.
Aleema addressed the arrest on social media this morning, saying, “(The policemen) brutally assaulted our staff, harassed my daughter-in-law, and forcibly took away my son, Shahrez Khan, in front of his two young daughters.”
She added, “For over three years, this fascist regime in Pakistan has unleashed a reign of terror, raiding thousands of homes, abducting and harassing countless innocent civilians.”
However, she said that it had not broken Imran and that he had set a “remarkable standard of resilience against tyranny”.
 






Speaking on the incident today, Aleema addressed the notion that the move was an attempt to scare the PTI.
“Do we look like we will be scared of such things?” she said.
She added, “In every FIR (first information report), it is written: ‘Aleema Khan comes bringing Imran Khan’s message’. So if we have to bring Imran Khan’s message in every FIR, we will absolutely do that. We will absolutely be his voice and give his complete message.”
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Imran’s son Kasim Khan termed the arrests “blatant state repression”.
 






Lahore ATC judge sends Shahrez on 8-day physical remand
Meanwhile, a Lahore anti-terrorism court (ATC) sent Shahrez on an eight-day physical remand. The suspect was presented in the Lahore ATC today before Judge Manzar Ali Gul.
The investigating officer told the judge that Shahrez was arrested in relation to the Jinnah House attack on May 9. He added that the suspect was first named in the case on September 23, 2023, in supplementary statements.
To this, Shahrez’s counsel, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alleged that his client had never been named in the case, branding the arrest an act of “harassment”.
He questioned why he had never been arrested before, despite being in the country for 27 months. The legal counsel called the move a “reaction to the approval of Imran’s bail pleas”.
On Wednesday,  the Supreme Court accepted Imran’s bail petitions in eight cases related to the May 9 riots. The PTI founder has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail since August 2023 in cases related to the selling of state gifts and a £190 million graft case, while he faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The investigation officer filed an application in the court for a 30-day physical remand for police investigation; however, the court approved only eight days and directed the police to present Shahrez at the next hearing.
Raja, speaking to the media outside the court, said Shahrez was “falsely implicated”. He vowed to fight against the case, saying, “We will go to every court.”
“This is a message to the nation that there is no law in this country,” he said, adding that “cases are being fabricated”.
Questioning the validity of the case, Raja alleged that during the events of May 9, Shahrez was in Chitral.
“This is madness and a well-thought-out conspiracy,” he added. “We have to stand with the founder of PTI and his family.”
Tallal Chaudhry defends arrests
Meanwhile, speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry defended the arrests and said they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”, saying that both siblings were present at the scene of the Jinnah House vandalism.
“One was on the vehicle on which Hassaan Niazi was making his speech and the other, when he was arrested, himself told that he was also present there.”
In contrast to the state minister’s claims, the PTI said Shahrez was in Chitral at the time of the May 9 riots.
“Family and friends of Shahrez shared pictures, videos, and WhatsApp messages, including timestamps and metadata, which show that he and his wife were on a trip to Chitral, in the northern mountainous region of Pakistan, from May 6th through May 12th.”
 






PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said: “The fact is that he was in Chitral during that week in May 2023 and was simply not present in Lahore.”
 






Questioned about the same, Chaudhry said: “The first thing to consider is that if there will be no evidence, then definitely, if his uncle (Imran Khan) can get bail … then so will he.”
Pushed back on the matter, the minister said it had taken time to gather the evidence and reiterated that Shershah was present with Niazi. “To say that this was preplanned or something, then the arrest would’ve been made a long time ago. So many times you have to wait for the police version and evidence.”</p><small>2025-08-22 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22185737a047aa0.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934223/pakistan-did-not-request-anyone-to-make-india-sit-down-for-talks-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan did not request anyone to make India sit down for talks: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that Pakistan had not requested anyone to make India sit down for talks of any kind.
“Pakistan did not ask anyone to arrange talks with India. Pakistan is ready for comprehensive talks with India, including on the Kashmir issue,” he told journalists at Parliament House.
Talking about the May conflict between the two countries and the subsequent ceasefire, he said the latter was still underway.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
Talking about the halt in hostilities, Dar said: “India had requested the US for a ceasefire. I received a call from the US for a ceasefire. I had made it clear that Pakistan did not want war.”
The foreign minister said that Pakistan had been suggested to sit down at a neutral venue for talks, to which he had expressed his willingness to do so.
“I had made it clear that there will be no discussion on any single-point agenda with India. We will discuss all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir issue with India,” he said, adding that “unnecessary rhetoric” continued flowing from India meanwhile.
He also said a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Pakistan was not yet scheduled.
Pakistan ready for dialogue with India: FO spokesperson
Foreign Office spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan noted that Pakistan is ready for composite dialogue with India, reiterating remarks made earlier by FM Dar.
Fielding questions from reporters during a weekly press briefing, the spokesperson said Pakistan is ready for “composite dialogue” with India on all matters, not just the issue of terrorism.
“India says that they would talk on terrorism only; however, we want to talk on all matters, including terrorism,” Khan said. “We have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan, but this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
 


Khan added that Islamabad would welcome attempts by other countries, including the United States, to bring Pakistan and India to the table for talks. However, responding to a question, he said there is no meeting in the works between the prime ministers of both countries.
Responding to another question about Indian military buildup, Khan called it an “alarming trend” and a threat to regional stability.
“It becomes more sinister when you look at their declaratory policy, and the domestic developments in India, which are so hostile towards Pakistan, and increasingly Islamophobic,” the spokesperson outlined.
“We have been raising this issue with our partners. The international community turning a blind eye to India’s mad rush to develop their military capabilities is a very dangerous trend.”
However, he assured that Pakistan remains ready and has the capability to respond to any threat or action by India.
Tarar lauds media’s role during conflict with India
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the media for its role in countering Indian narratives during the military confrontation and praised it for delivering the country’s message to the world in the face of a much larger media apparatus in India.
Addressing a meeting of the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) in Islamabad, Tarar labelled that period as “extraordinary circumstances”.
“Right from the beginning, it was a war of narratives,” he highlighted. “The enemy had greater resources, international interest, lobbying and PR firms. International media outlets had employees of Indian origin because of their greater population.”
The minister stated that Pakistan’s strength was not in numbers or resources, but in “having the truth”.
“The truth cannot hide or be countered,” Tarar stated. “While the prime minister asked for an inquiry into the Pahalgam attack at Kakul, India was levelling allegations without evidence.”
Tarar then described a “synergy” between the armed forces and the information ministry during wartime, noting that the ministry’s “state-of-the-art data centre was maybe made for this purpose so that we could fight a war of narratives”.
He thanked the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations “for this synergy”.
“This war was fought by everyone together, with your help and your content. The way things were written and disseminated was a team effort,” he stated.
 


Tarar said that due to the media’s coverage during the fighting, Pakistan experienced a resurgence on the international stage.
“Across the world, people have greater respect for Pakistan and take us seriously,” he said.
“There was this false glorification of ‘rising India’, how it was this big economy and rising power in South Asia. That same Modi has to give fake medals in countries whose names we have never heard of.
“However much factual information we were spreading, they (India) were spreading as many lies,” he added.
“Their media has been terribly exposed, while our media became part of our diplomatic effort and spokespersons for our foreign policy. They took every step for our defence.”
Stating that the Pakistan Navy was ready for any Indian engagement, the minister quipped that “when the enemy found they could not destroy Karachi port, they destroyed ports in Multan and Lahore instead”.
“An Indian channel said that Indian media is a spokesperson for foreign policy and Pakistani media is adrift. I’d like to say to that person that they should be ashamed of the lies and propaganda and how they are being mocked globally,” Tarar stated.
“The whole country played a role in this effort, as did the CPNE, which will be remembered fondly for its role as a wartime body,” he said, stressing the need to acknowledge the CPNE’s “wartime cabinet” and how the council “played a role in narrative building and defeating the enemy during this war”.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22213846300a1b4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934392/pakistan-fisherfolk-forums-fatima-majeed-appointed-head-of-sindh-fisheries-department' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum’s Fatima Majeed appointed head of Sindh Fisheries Department</strong></a><br><p>Climate activist Fatima Majeed has been appointed as the chairperson of the Sindh Fisheries Department, becoming the first woman from the fishing community to become so, it emerged on Friday.
Majeed is an activist, social worker and senior vice-chairperson of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF).
The PFF, a democratic organisation with over 100,000 memberships across the country, having a minimum 35 per cent women ratio, today is one of the strongest social movements in Pakistan.
It has, over the years, proven itself as a nursery for producing leaders in the fishing and peasant communities of Pakistan.
 
 

Its struggle targets policy issues related to fishing rights, fish marketing and fish conservation, rehabilitation of the Indus Delta, sustainable fisheries policy, abolition of the contract system over inland waters, historical fishing rights on entire water bodies for indigenous fisherfolk, discouraging industrial fishing by deep sea trawlers and marine pollution, and detention of fishermen.
In a post on X today, the Sindh Information Department announced that Majeed was appointed to the role “in line with the inclusive vision of [PPP] Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and the Sindh government’s commitment to women empowerment”.
It added that she was the first woman from a fishing community to lead the vital sector.
“This milestone reflects a strong commitment to community empowerment, inclusive representation, and merit-based leadership within public institutions,” it said.
 






Majeed has participated in protests every year for the past three years against climate change and demanding climate justice.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in March that Pakistan had formally accepted the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.
WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had said Pakistan’s formal acceptance of the agreement marked a vital step toward ensuring the long-term sustainability of global marine resources, while safeguarding the livelihoods and food security of the millions of people, who depend on healthy fisheries.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2220061990c817e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934294/president-zardari-constitutes-11th-national-finance-commission-to-divvy-up-revenue' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari constitutes 11th National Finance Commission to divvy up revenue</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday constituted the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) to announce a new award for the sharing of federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
According to a notification from the Finance Division, the president constituted the commission with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as the chairman and the four provincial finance ministers as its members.
The commission also includes former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa as a member representing the Punjab government, economist and researcher Asad Sayeed as a member representing the Sindh government, former bureaucrat Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan as a member representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Farmanullah as a member representing the Balochistan government.
The commission will make recommendations to the president on the distribution between the federation and the provinces of the ““net proceeds of the taxes mentioned in clause (3) of Article 160 of the Constitution”, it read.
The taxes are taxes on income, including corporation tax, but not including taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund; taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed; export duties on cotton, and such other export duties as may be specified by the president; duties of excise as may be specified by the president and other taxes as may be specified by the president.
The body will also recommend the president regarding the grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provincial governments and the exercise, by the federal government and the provincial governments, of the borrowing powers conferred by the Constitution.
The commission will further make recommendations to the president on issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation in respect of subjects and matters falling within the domain of the provinces; issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation or the provinces or both in respect of trans-provincial matters; issues relating to financial expense for national projects to be shared by the federation and the provinces; and any other matter relating to finance referred to the commission by the president.
For several years, policymakers associated with the finance ministry, as well as political actors across different parties at the centre, have spoken about revising revenue transfers to the provinces to improve the federal government’s financial position.
The 10th NFC expired on July 21. The 7th NFC Award has now been in effect for nearly 15 years — far beyond its five-year tenure. The president has extended the award every year due to a disagreement between the provinces and the Centre over the new formula.

Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
A statement from Rescue 1122 said, “200 people have been rescued from flood-affected areas and have been shifted to Ghizer’s Yangal and Samal areas.”
“Several people have been traumatised after [their] houses were destroyed. Medical assistance is being provided to the affected people,” it added.
In another statement issued earlier today, Rescue 1122 said, “A terrible incident of glacier outburst has taken place at Tildas and Rawshan villages in Gupis valley late at night, causing widespread destruction in the downstream.”
“The Ghizer River has been completely blocked for several hours, which has increased the risks for downstream areas with a possibility of high-level flooding in the river,” it added.
The statement said that the rescue personnel had been kept on alert on the orders of the Rescue 1122 director general and the Rescue 1122 District Emergency Officer Engineer Tahir Shah. Rescue 1122 also urged people living near the river to take timely precautionary measures and move to safe places.
GB Secretary Fida Hussain said that no casualties were reported and all the affected people were safe.
“The flood swept away everything in the downstream areas in Talidas and Rawshan villages,” he said, adding that 40 people, who were stranded, had been rescued.
He added that local volunteers were the first to rescue people from the floodwaters, after which Pakistan Army helicopters joined the operation.
“The high temperature caused a burst of the lake, and ultimately high flooding occurred in the Sado nullah on Wednesday night.
“Some shepherds informed the local community about the flood. People in dangerous areas were immediately shifted to other areas,” he said.
According to the locals, 80 per cent of the village has been washed away. A local named Abdul Wahid said, “Some shepherds, who were living near the glacier, had informed people living in the downstream areas through mobile communication about the flood and urged them to evacuate.”
The local administration said that the Ghizer River, after remaining blocked for eight hours, started spilling over the flood debris.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that a rescue operation was initiated to evacuate the stranded people in the areas. He said, “The flow of the Ghizer River has remained blocked for many hours, but it poses a threat to low-lying areas if it bursts.”
Ghulam Muhammad, GB Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism, said, “The flood, which occurred due to the bursting of the lake, completely destroyed 70 houses, while the river water is standing due to the flood debris, but the level is rising.”
He said that if the flow of the river water is not restored, hundreds of large houses will be submerged in the water. “The process of flooding in the drain due to the bursting of the lake has been ongoing since 10pm.”
Muhammad further said that the river spread three to four kilometres in length due to the standing water.
“Some people are still trapped, for whom an army helicopter has been sent to rescue them. Hopefully, the trapped people will also be rescued,” he added.

GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan issued orders to the GB home secretary and GB Disa­ster Manage­ment Aut­h­ority director general to immediately rescue the people trapped in the flood.
The CM said, “All available resources will be utilised to rescue the precious human lives and help will be sought from the Pakistan Army.”
He also directed the Gilgit and Ghizer police officials and the concerned departments to ensure safety measures in the settlements adjacent to the river.
Meanwhile, Senator Sherry Rehman highlighted that not a single life was lost during the glacial outburst due to the functional early warning system.
“This is living proof of why Pakistan must urgently scale alert systems, local response teams and community training nationwide,” she wrote in a post on X.
 






Special Assistant to CM on Information Eman Shah said that authorities have started initial relief and rescue activities. “Steps are being taken to shift people from Ghizer River downstream areas to safer places in fear of the temporary lake formed in Ghizer bursting,” he said.
Earlier this month, a Glof from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.

A massive explosion took place inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on MA Jinnah Road yesterday afternoon, in which 33 people were injured and two were confirmed to have lost their lives.
Rescue 1122 said today that the number of deaths from the incident had risen to six after a fourth body was retrieved. South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG)  Syed Asad Raza said earlier today that two people had died during treatment, while three bodies were recovered from the site.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the deaths occurred because of “multiple crush injuries and suffocation”. She said one died owing to suffocation, and two other deaths occurred from multiple crush injuries, while the autopsy of two other bodies could not be conducted.
Meanwhile, Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the fire was extinguished on Thursday around 5pm, but cooling operations were still underway today. He said the Bomb Disposal Squad has examined the warehouse where fireworks were stored.

DIG Raza said Preedy Police registered a case against the two brothers who owned the facility — one of whom was injured — under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 322 (punishment for manslaughter), 324 (attempted murder), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
As per the first information report, the suspects had stored fireworks in “excessive” quantities in a haphazard manner without any precautionary measures, and their negligence and carelessness caused loss of precious human lives and injuries and substantive damages to property.
It added that one suspect was injured in the incident, while another was present during the time of the blast and had managed to escape from the spot in his car.
Sharing findings of experts, Raza said during inspection of the warehouse, nearly 300 cartons weighing 500 kilogrammes of fireworks material were burnt due to some “mishandling”. The building was “badly” damaged, while the blast also caused serious effects spread over 180 metres in the surrounding area.
The DIG said about 5,000kg of fireworks material was still lying in the building’s three godowns in two containers, while other material was also lying outside the building in an open place in “dangerous condition” which required urgent demolition or disposal, as per findings of the BDS team.
“We are removing and disposing of the rest of the explosives with the help of concerned agencies,” he said.

Haseeb had told Dawn.com that the facility was situated in the basement of a three-storey commercial and residential building in Saddar.
“Raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers was stored [in this facility],” Khan said. “During the initial probe, it was suspected that a short circuit triggered a fire in the store, and a huge explosion took place because of the presence of highly inflammable material.”
However, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) senior official Raja Umer Khattab had told reporters that the facility contained explosive material, not raw material for fireworks.
“CTD had seized two tons of explosive material in this area in the recent past,” he said, noting that the raw material in fireworks could also be used in bombs.
The rescue spokesperson added that the building’s pillars and walls were damaged, while thick concrete blocks had fallen on parked vehicles nearby. Windows in nearby buildings were also smashed.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Earlier this month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control after hours of efforts.</p><small>2025-08-22 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2219300116b2633.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934260/pakistan-dominates-at-amerigol-latam-ice-hockey-tournament-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dominates at Amerigol Latam ice hockey tournament in US</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani teams on Thursday displayed their prowess at the Amerigol Latam Cup ice hockey tournament in Coral Springs, Florida in the United States with the men’s team clinching the Division III championship and the women’s team claiming the Division II bronze medal in their debut appearance.
The tournament is designed to showcase talent from regions where ice hockey is a growing sport and “break barriers and unite non-traditional hockey markets in a thrilling display of skill, passion, and camaraderie”, according to the organisers’ website.
A press release from the National Hockey League (NHL), stated that this year’s Latam Cup features 62 women’s, men’s and youth teams and over 1,450 players representing 17 countries and territories. The tournament started on Sunday and will continue through August 24.
The NHL stated that Pakistan’s men’s team went undefeated throughout the tournament and playoffs, defeating Peru 6-1 to win the championship for the first time.
 






The Pakistani Ice Hockey Team wrote in an Instagram post: “Pakistan men’s Division III champions! Undefeated run capped off with gold. What a tournament!”
In their first outing in the Latam Cup last year, Pakistan only won one game.
“I thought we’d be winning several years from now,” said Donny Khan, the NHL’s senior director of hockey development and strategic collaboration. “I didn’t think we’d be doing this in year two.”
The NHL stated that Khan helped form the Pakistani teams that competed.
 






Kameron Sabir, an Edmonton physician who coached the men’s team, was quoted as saying, “You can’t do better than this first gold … first cup.
“It’s just an amazing day for the country and ice hockey. The women did such an amazing job too. Tremendous [performance] for their first tournament. They had only 10-12 players, so hats off to them.”
Mariya Rauf, who coached the women’s team, clutched a cricket bat given to her by her players and smiled while watching the men celebrate their victory against Peru, the NHL said.
“Cricket is our national sport, but I think after this, it just shows [ice] hockey’s growing very single day,” she was quoted as saying. “This shows that there’s talent and that we’re just going to keep getting better.”
Rauf is also a junior forward on Yale University’s National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I women’s ice hockey team.
The NHL noted that most of the countries and territories competing in the tournament aspire to play ice hockey on the world stage, but don’t have skating rinks or suitable ice facilities that meet International Ice Hockey Federation regulations, enabling them to compete in events like the Olympics.
“The hope is that exposure from winning or competing in the tournament will persuade sports federations, Olympic committees or private investors in those countries and territories to support ice hockey, mainly by building rinks,” the NHL stated.</p><small>2025-08-22 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2218555908784ad.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934208/how-floods-in-pakistan-turned-wedding-celebrations-into-24-funerals' target='_blank'><strong>How floods in Pakistan turned wedding celebrations into 24 funerals</strong></a><br><p>Two days before his wedding, Noor Muhammad had a long phone call with his mother, just hours before devastating floods in Pakistan killed her along with 23 family members and relatives.
“I cannot explain how happy she was,” he said standing by the rubble of his family’s large 36-room house, perched on the bank of a floodwater channel in Qadir Nagar village.
The village in mountainous Buner district has been the worst hit by recent massive rain in the country, accounting for over 200 deaths out of nearly 400 in floods in the northern areas since August 15.
Buner is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Islamabad.
“Everything was finished,” sobbed Muhammad, 25, as mourners sat at his damaged house to offer condolences, saying there was nothing left when he got home except for rubble and heavy rocks, which swept down from the mountains along with mud and raging flood waters, smashing into houses, markets and buildings.
“The flood came, a huge flood came, it swept away everything, home, mother, sister, brother, my uncle, my grandfather and children.”

Muhammad works as a labourer in Malaysia. He arrived at the Islamabad airport on August 15 to drive home where his wedding preparations were in full swing for two days later. Instead, he attended 24 funerals.
They included his mother, a brother and a sister, he said, adding that his father and another brother survived because they had gone to pick him up at the airport.
The rest of the fatalities were among his uncles’ families who shared the house built by his grandfather, and relatives who are attending his marriage.
His fiance survived. Her home was away from the worst of the damage.
Devastating flash floods
The flash floods triggered by the worst of this year’s monsoon and cloudbursts, which started in the mountainous northern areas have spread to other parts of the country of 240 million, bringing death and destruction at a large scale.
Authorities have said the longer spell of heavy rain and rare cloudbursts were rooted in climate change due to global warming, fearing the intensity will increase in the coming years.
“We and our elders have never seen a storm like this in our lives,” said Muhammad Zeb, 28, a resident in Buner. It was a complete chaos, and massive disaster, he added.
“You can see for yourself, this was a beautiful place with homes. But now, as you can see, the flood and storm have swept everything away.”

An unknown number of people remain missing, with dead bodies still being recovered, officials said.
The overall death toll across the country in the monsoon rains which began in late June stood at 776, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, which said more than 25,000 people had been rescued in the northern areas.
 
 

The army and air force have joined the rescue and relief efforts.
Officials have warned of more storms ahead with another two spells of monsoon rain expected until September 10.
Buner received more than 150 mm (5.91 inches)of rain within an hour triggered by a cloudburst in the single most destructive event in this monsoon season. A cloudburst is a rare phenomenon where more than 100mm (3.9 inches) of rainfall within an hour in a small area.
Only four people of the 28 in his house survived, Muhammad said. “What else can we say? It’s God’s will,” he said.

The senior journalist was found dead in his car last week, parked on Hyderabad Road in Sanghar under what police termed “mysterious circumstances”. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound to the head.
The day after the incident, police said that they were probing the incident “from all possible angles” and a fact-finding committee had been formed to probe Hussain’s death. This committee, led by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police (IGP) (Counter-Terrorism Department) Azad Khan, comprised Karachi West Zone Deputy IGP Irfan Baloch and Sanghar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abid Baloch.
The committee reached its conclusion based on a detailed examination of the crime scene, interviews of witnesses, examination of postmortem and forensic reports and analysis of CCTV footage, concluding that the cause of death was suicide.
“It is clear from the firearm forensic report that the lone bullet that caused [the] death of the deceased was fired from his 9mm licensed pistol, recovered from his right hand,” the report read.
The report noted that Hussain’s vehicle was parked outside a restaurant in Sanghar for two hours, according to an “exhaustive” analysis of CCTV footage from the scene. It stated that there was no evidence that he met anyone, nor did anyone approach the vehicle.
“The blackening (soot deposition) around the entry wound mentioned in the first postmortem report of Civil Hospital Sanghar suggests a close-range shot. The re-postmortem carried out at LUH (Liaquat University Hospital), Hyderabad, mentions blackening, charring (burn around wound margin) and muzzle mark (abrasion/imprint of muzzle of weapon on skin) at entry wound.”
The report stated that muzzle marks are produced when the muzzle of a firearm is pressed firmly against the skin at the time of firing.
“The findings exclude homicide or accidental fire as a cause of death,” the report stated. “The committee finds suicide as the only probable cause of death.”
The committee was also of the opinion that Hussain died sometime between 9:58pm and 10:35pm. It also noted that its findings are unlikely to change, despite reports pending from laboratory and gunshot residue tests.
“A number of journalists and acquaintances confided, off the record, about some friendships of the deceased, that were [the] cause of severe rift between him and his spouse,” the report stated, mentioning that the motive behind the incident needed further investigation.
“However, this aspect was not touched upon for the time being, as this would require interviewing and questioning his friends, colleagues and family members, at this time of grief.”
A request was submitted to the Sindh Home Department for the constitution of a medical board comprising senior doctors and forensic experts to perform a “fair, transparent, and impartial postmortem examination”.
Sanghar SSP Baloch said that Hussain’s brother-in-law told police that he did not inform them about his Saturday arrival, although he asked them to hold an annual religious ritual as per the family’s tradition. Hussain had neither told friends in Sanghar about his visit nor did he attend the ritual.
“His sister confirmed that he had celebrated Eidul Azha with her on her insistence, after their parents shifted to the US this May,” he said.</p><small>2025-08-22 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2217422777f8ccf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934149/five-iran-police-killed-in-sistan-baluchestan-province-ambush' target='_blank'><strong>Five Iran police killed in Sistan-Baluchestan province ambush</strong></a><br><p>At least five Iranian police have been killed in an ambush in the restive Sistan-Baluchestan province, Iranian media reported on Friday.
The unidentified assailants struck two units on patrol near the town of Iranshahr, the Fars news agency said, citing local police.
“In this terrorist act, five servants of security and peace were martyred,” it quoted police as saying.
Sistan-Baluchestan, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, has long been a flashpoint for clashes between security forces and armed groups, including drug traffickers and separatists.
The province, which is home to a large Sunni Muslim Baloch minority, is one of the poorest regions of the Shia-majority country.
Police said the officers had been on routine patrol when they came under fire. Iranian media published an image of a bullet-riddled police pickup with bodies lying on the ground nearby.
An operation was underway to “track down and identify” the assailants, Fars said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility.
Iran regularly reports deadly ambushes in the province targeting police or Revolutionary Guards.
Authorities blame militant groups, including Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice).
The latest attack comes after authorities said the security forces had killed seven members of another armed group, Ansar al-Furqan, last week as they foiled an attempted attack.
A day earlier, a police officer was killed in an attack later claimed by Jaish al-Adl.</p><small>2025-08-22 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221423362cbdf58.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933933/commerce-minister-meets-bangladesh-govt-adviser-to-discuss-bilateral-trade-enhancement' target='_blank'><strong>Commerce minister meets Bangladesh govt adviser to discuss bilateral trade enhancement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s commerce minister and a Bangladeshi government adviser met in Dhaka on Friday to discuss the enhancement of bilateral trade and the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
A press release by the Ministry of Commerce said that Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, who reached Dhaka on August 21 for an official visit, met with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Commerce Sheikh Bashir Uddin.  During the interaction, both sides “held in-depth discussions in Dhaka today to advance economic cooperation, mutual investments and strengthen bilateral trade ties”.
It added that Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Imran Haider, was also present during the meeting.
“The two countries are in the process of establishing a Joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade,” the statement said.
According to the ministry, both sides agreed to re-activate the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) forum to work out a comprehensive strategy for the promotion of trade, investment and economic collaborations.
The statement pointed out that the last meeting of the JEC was held in 2005.
The two sides also agreed to form a joint trade commission, which would present a roadmap for building on the existing bilateral trade relations, set goals for future commercial ties and define steps to achieve those targets.
“The minister and adviser discussed sectors including agricultural modernisation, renewable energy, steel industry, green ship breaking, ship building, dates, minerals, construction aggregates, halal trade, sugar, leather, rice, dehydrated fruits and agro-processing,” the ministry said.
The two noted the need to improve and economise connectivity and logistics for trade to cut costs. They also discussed the reduction of tariffs and duties and preferential access to certain Bangladeshi products in the Pakistani market.
Both sides underscored that there was a vast untapped potential of bilateral trade and that both countries were “all set to benefit” from such opportunities.
 
 

“The two governments should build on the existing momentum and swiftly move to create a more conducive environment,” the ministry statement concluded.
The commerce minister is currently on a visit to Bangladesh. He was received by Bashir Uddin upon his arrival in Dhaka yesterday.
“Looking forward to engagements with officials and business leaders,” he said on social media.
 






Yesterday, he held discussions with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Industries Adilur Rahman Khan to explore avenues for industrial cooperation between the two countries. He emphasised Pakistan’s interest in being a part of Bangladesh’s evolving industrial landscape through collaboration, joint ventures and mutual investment.
Separately, Bangladesh Army Quarter Master General Lieutenant General Faizur Rahman called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, according to the military’s media wing.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the prevailing security environment in the region and laid emphasis on shared resolve for enhancing existing cooperation in defence and security domain,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement.
 






“The Chairman JCSC highlighted the rising trajectory of bilateral relations between both the countries and identified new avenues of defence cooperation,” it added.
It concluded that the visiting dignitary “lauded the professionalism of Pakistan Armed Forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in fight against terrorism”.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) confirmed that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will pay an official visit to Dhaka over the weekend on Bangladesh’s invitation.
The FO said he will hold important meetings with various Bangladeshi leaders, including Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and Adviser for Foreign Affairs Touhid Hossain.
“The whole range of bilateral relations and a number of regional and international issues will be discussed during these meetings.”

Wickremesinghe, 76, who lost power in a 2024 election, had been investigated over a visit he made to London to attend his wife’s graduation ceremony, local media reported.
Police confirmed his arrest for alleged misuse of public funds.
“Former president Ranil Wickremesinghe has been arrested and produced in court. We are awaiting the court directive to decide what further steps need to be taken,” a police spokesperson said.
Wickremesinghe’s office did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
An ally from his United National Party (UNP) proclaimed his innocence and suggested the case was politically motivated.
“Ranil Wickremesinghe has never misused public funds or state funds,” UNP member Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told reporters gathered outside the court complex where the former president appeared in Colombo.
“He was the person who stepped up and accepted the challenge to save this country when the economy collapsed,” Warnasinghe said. “That is the person who is being treated like this today by this government.”
Sri Lanka’s cabinet spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Political Family
Wickremesinghe, a lawyer who also served as Sri Lanka’s prime minister a record six times, became president in 2022 at the height of the Indian Ocean island nation’s debilitating financial crisis.
Wickremesinghe, who leads the UNP, took over after widespread protests caused by an economic meltdown forced his predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to flee the country and later resign.
He finished third in last year’s presidential election — the first since the economic crisis — behind Marxist-leaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who won the vote, and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.
The election was largely seen as a referendum on Wickremesinghe, who led a successful but fragile economic recovery that included painful austerity measures.
Born into a prominent family of politicians and businessmen with significant media interests, Wickremesinghe was, at 29, appointed the country’s youngest cabinet minister by his uncle, then-President Junius Jayewardene in 1978.
In 1994, following the assassinations of several of his senior colleagues, Wickremesinghe became leader of the UNP.</p><small>2025-08-22 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22172816d2feab0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934115/saleema-imtiaz-set-for-odi-debut-in-pakistan-south-africa-womens-series' target='_blank'><strong>Saleema Imtiaz set for ODI debut in Pakistan-South Africa women’s series</strong></a><br><p>Saleema Imtiaz is set for her umpiring debut in the upcoming women’s ODI series between Pakistan and South Africa in Lahore, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Friday, alongside confirming other match officials for the series.
Last year, Saleema became the first Pakistani female official to join ICC’s International Panel of Development Umpires, enabling her to officiate women’s bilateral international matches and ICC women’s events.
The three-match One-Day International series will be staged at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from September 16-22.
Saleema, who is part of the ICC International Panel of Umpires will be joined by Australia’s Claire Polosak, who returns to Pakistan after officiating in the Pakistan v West Indies women’s series last year in Karachi, PCB said.
Polosak, also a member of the ICC International Panel of Umpires, will stand in all three ODIs as an on-field umpire.
 






Humairah Farah has been named as the reserve umpire for the series, while Tariq Rasheed from the PCB Elite Panel of Umpires will also perform duty of an on-field umpire during the series.
Former Test cricketer Ali Naqvi, a member of the PCB and ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, will lead the playing control team, PCB said.

The Chinese foreign minister arrived in Pakistan late Wednesday night to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue on Thursday morning. He also met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirming China’s commitment to working with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability.
Wang said that China was prepared to support its neighbours on issues concerning their core interests and to firmly oppose external interference in the region, per a Chinese foreign ministry handout. He stressed the need to improve the security dialogue mechanism, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, strengthen the fight against transnational terrorism, and eliminate conditions that promote extremism.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, Wang and COAS Munir held discussions focused on regional security, counter-terrorism and matters of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the strategic partnership and enhance coordination at regional and international forums.”
Wang reiterated China’s steadfast support for Pakistan’s sovereignty and development, the statement said, adding that COAS Munir expressed gratitude for China’s consistent support for Pakistan.
The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to advance peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, it said.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership that covers trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. Their militaries have built deep mutual trust and cooperation, and both sides agreed to sustain high-level visits while enhancing collaboration in joint training, exercises and military technology.
On August 1, COAS Munir, while speaking at an event marking the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army of China, stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Islamabad and Beijing will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Last month, during COAS Munir’s visit to Beijing, the Chinese leadership had lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.

The 27-year-old threw a massive 77.43m on his sixth and final attempt to snag a podium finish and smash his previous season’s best of 76.07m set at the Asian Athletics Championships in May.
Sri Lanka’s Pathirage Rumesh Tharanga won gold with an 82.05m throw and became the only athlete to cross the 80m barrier this morning. Behind him was Japan’s Gen Naganuma with 78.60m.
 


Yasir opened his campaign with a no-throw, followed by a solid 75.79m. He the then threw two successive throws in the 72m range before anther no-throw on his fifth attempt.
It was on his final attempt that he struck his medal-winning 77.43m throw.
Yasir said in a social media post that he was “happy for a podium finish” and season’s best throw despite “tough conditions”.
He thanked his supporters and hoped for more medals in the future.

Yasir clinched a silver at last year’s championships with a 78.10m throw, and a bronze in 2023 with a 79.93m throw, which still stands as his personal best.
The javelin ace has yet to shatter the 80m barrier.

Earlier this month, the court ruled that all stray dogs in Delhi and its suburbs be moved to shelters following a surge in dog bites and cases of rabies. Critics of the ruling had said it could not be implemented because there were not enough shelters.
Many animal lovers took to the streets to protest against the order. Animal rights activists signed online petitions asking the court to revoke its decision.
The court ruling also drew criticism from politicians and celebrities.
India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi called it a “step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy”.
 






On Friday, the court said that dogs picked up in the past few weeks in Delhi and its suburbs would be released after sterilisation and immunisation, barring those showing aggressive behaviour or signs of rabies infection.
Former federal minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi told ANI news agency that she was happy with the “scientific decision” of relocating dogs back to their area. The court has not clarified what “an aggressive dog” is and this remains a grey area, she added.
In April, the government said nearly 430,000 cases of dog bites were reported nationwide in January, against 3.7 million cases in all of 2024.
India has 52.5m stray dogs, a survey of homeless pets by Mars Petcare has shown, with 8m canines in shelters. Media reports suggest Delhi alone has 1m stray dogs. Reuters could not independently verify the figure.
To curb public feeding of stray dogs, the court also directed the setting-up of designated zones.
A three-judge panel of the court said the scope of the case would be expanded across India and the court would formulate a uniform policy for all stray dogs soon.
“On behalf of the community dogs we serve, we thank the three-judge bench for its decision,” animal rights group PETA India said on Friday, urging people to adopt dogs and support sterilisation efforts.

The exchange of fire took place near Karmazi Stop, as troops were carrying out an operation to take control of a key militant stronghold. Sources said security forces managed to establish two new posts in the area.
Officials said that several militants initially managed to take refuge inside a nearby structure, but later fled during the clearance operation.
The crossfire left 11 residents injured, who were provided first aid before being shifted to the District Headq­uarters Hospital in Wana.
 
 

Witnesses said intermittent firing continued throughout the day, and residents said the area remained tense throughout the operation, with families confined to their homes for several hours. The Wana-Azam Warsak Road remained closed until around 1pm, disrupting routine life and leaving thousands unable to reach Wana Rustam bazaar.

Several militants believed to be among those killed in Bajaur explosion

Security officials confirmed that the road was later cleared.
Separately, several people were killed an explosion in the remote Charmang region of Bajaur’s Nawagai tehsil.
Although the exact cause of the incident is yet to be established, some sources claimed that a number of militants were among those killed. By some accounts, over two dozen individuals were killed in the explosion, which occurred in a mosque located in a hilly area. The remoteness of the region made it difficult to obtain independent confirmation of the incident.
It may be recalled that Operation Sarbakaf is currently underway in Bajaur, and residents have been evacuated from parts of the district as security forces work to root out a militant presence in the area.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, on either incident, until going to press.
