For several years, policymakers associated with the finance ministry, as well as political actors across different parties at the centre, have spoken about revising revenue transfers to the provinces to improve the federal government’s financial position.
Such a revision would have most certainly happened earlier had it not been for the compulsions of centre-province politics (especially the PPP’s strength and position on the matter) and the constitutional protection accorded to the provincial share under the 18th Amendment.
Article 160-3A currently states that “the share of the Provinces in each Award of National Finance Commission shall not be less than the share given to the Provinces in the previous Award”. The current share is 57.5 per cent.
 
 

There are no clear workarounds available at the moment. The centre managed to take out the lucrative petroleum levy from the divisible pool by calling it a developmental levy rather than a tax (which it is in all but name). However, any further change would require amending the Constitution — either by doing away with Article 160-3A that places a floor on the downward transfer, or by amending Article 160-3 to take out transferrable revenue sources. The former is more likely than the latter.
What are the political prospects of this change?
The recent reconfiguration of the ruling coalition’s National Assembly strength, through the bizarre reserved seats judgement, hands over a virtual two-thirds majority to the ruling coalition and its allies. The provincial assembly numbers have also been skewed the same way, paving the way for more favourable Senate numbers. Recent outcomes of the Senate polls from KP already show this strategy bearing fruit.

The NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre.

In any case, as demonstrated by the past year, constitutional norms hardly pose much of a challenge for the governing regime. Numbers can be conjured up and subsequently validated by the courts. A bigger unknown variable here is the PPP’s position on the matter.
The reserved seat reallocation may have slightly diluted the PPP’s importance and strengthened the PML-N, but a constitutional amendment will require everyone on the treasury benches to play along. Given its foundational role in the current NFC and the 18th Amendment, the PPP’s position has remained consistent in favour of large transfers to the provinces. It’s unclear what would compel the needle to move on this front. If the establishment decides it wants to push ahead with it, inducements and coercion will both be applied.
At a broader level, most talk around the NFC focuses on its technical and developmental dimensions. Centrists in favour of cutting the provinces’ share usually provide some or all of the following arguments:

The centre bears large expenses, such as social protection, power subsidies, pensions, defence and debt-servicing while getting a minority sum from the divisible pool.
The centre puts in the effort to raise revenue but the majority gets transferred downwards.
The provinces are profligate, choosing to spend money inefficiently, with no notable improvements in core areas of health and education.
The provinces have no incentive to raise their own revenue.
The federal government’s own incentive to raise revenues is diminishing given how little is left for it to spend.

People can agree or disagree with these arguments, but the fact remains that the current system is constitutional in nature. What revenues are to be shared has a history going back nearly a century.
What is the percentage of that share was agreed upon by all legitimate political forces through deliberations 15 years ago. Contrary to how some present it, the NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre. It was, and remains, a consensual agreement.
But there is another perspective worth considering.
The NFC is also what provides space for any semblance of civilian politics under a hybrid regime. For much of the last decade, politics at the centre has remained hostage to the compulsions of civil-military intrigue and the demands of IMF programmes. There is little space for civilian political action on the development and policy front. Consequently, there is little that they can do politics on. Survival and success at the centre is correlated with compliance rather than performance.
 
 

It is instead in the provinces where there is far more space available, thanks to the flow of finances from the centre. Parties looking to cement or recover their electoral position use provincial finances to hand out patronage or demonstrate their developmental ambitions; whether that is through expanding public sector employment, initiating social protection programmes, or building large infrastructure projects.
This should not be mistaken as a justification for profligate and inefficient spending. Provincial political elites have not delivered on many fronts and for that they should be held accountable. But the political consequences of slashing the provincial share should be considered. A hard budget constraint on provincial finances, which many envision under a revised NFC, would place limits on the space for party politics in its current form. If that is the desired end goal (and for some, it seems that it is), then the demand for a revised NFC makes sense.
However, there is another proposal that can achieve greater province-level efficiency sought by the centrists, but doesn’t close off space for party politics. Instead of limiting transfers to the provinces, an amendment should guarantee further downward transfers to local governments, provided there are elected ones in place. In the absence of elected ones, the centre can hold back a designated share from the divisible pool. This helps solve the spending efficiency issue, allows space for developmental programmes that parties can use to claim political credit, and provides an incentive to have a functional third tier.

• Punjab gears up for sixth spell of heavy rains
ISLAMABAD: At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday.
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country.  The dead include 102 men, 57 women and 140 children, while the injured include 239 children, 204 women and 272 men.
The severe weather has also caused widespread destruction, damaging a total of 1,676 houses, according to the agency’s data.
Of those, 562 homes were completely destroyed while 1,114 sustained partial damage.
The floods also led to the loss of 428 livestock, compounding the impact on local communities.
In response, the NDMA said it has carried out 223 rescue operations, successfully evacuating 2,880 people from flood-hit regions.
The authority has distributed more than 13,400 relief items to affected communities. These include almost 2,000 tents, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, and over 1,100 food packs.
Relief teams have also provided 1,282 kitchen sets, 350 life jackets, 1,122 hygiene kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps, among other essential items.
Medical support has been mobilised, with 71 camps set up to treat those affected by the disaster. So far, 577 people have received medical attention.
The NDMA said the crisis has affected multiple regions, with joint relief operations underway in collaboration with provincial and federal agencies.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit-Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.
Next spell likely to be heavier
In Punjab, Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia warned residents on Sunday to prepare for a sixth round of heavy monsoon rains starting Aug 5.
“The ongoing rains could lead to medium to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with the risk expected to begin from Aug 5,” Mr Kathia said.
According to PDMA, monsoon rains in August are expected to be heavier than those experienced last month. Rain is predicted in dozens of districts, including Lahore, Mur­ree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhu­pura, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Mian­wali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Khanewal, and Rajanpur.
The warning advised of a specific risk of landslides in the tourist destinations of Murree and Galliyat, where weak buildings and mud houses could also be damaged.

For example, the latest edition of the relevant UN Security Council monitoring report on IS and Al Qaeda reveals that both the banned TTP and IS-K continue to operate in Afghanistan with relative freedom.
In fact, where the latter group is concerned, the report says that IS-K poses a major threat regionally and internationally. The UN document again validates what Pakistan has long been arguing — that the Afghan Taliban are not doing enough to address the presence of terrorist groups on their soil, and that these outfits pose a significant challenge to regional security.
With regard to the TTP, which has been carrying out terrorist attacks in Pakistan with regularity, the report states that the outfit has some 6,000 fighters, and that it “continued to receive … logistical and operational support” from the Afghan Taliban.
 
 

This is despite the fact that some within the Afghan Taliban were of the view that Afghanistan’s de facto rulers should distance themselves from the TTP. The document also observes that the TTP maintains ties with IS-K, Al Qaeda as well as Baloch militants.
Interestingly, the TTP seems to be ‘diversifying’ its options, as it has links with both the Afghan Taliban and IS-K, which oppose one another. The UN report points out that IS-K “is the most serious threat” regionally and internationally. For this country, it should be a matter of great concern that this dangerous group is reportedly operating “close to the Pakistani” border, where it is training suicide bombers, who include minors.
These findings should prompt the Pakistani state, regional countries as well as the international community to address the problem of militancy in Afghanistan with alacrity. Though the Foreign Office has said there has been “better receptivity” to Pakistan’s concerns in Kabul, concrete action is needed from the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that the potpourri of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil do not transform into a global security nightmare.
While Pakistan needs to secure its borders and ensure that TTP and IS-K terrorists are not able to enter the country and find a foothold here, on its part, Kabul must do much more to neutralise the militant threat in Afghanistan. The prospect of the TTP and IS-K joining forces is a frightening one, and this budding terrorist alliance must be nipped in the bud.
The TTP has spilt innocent blood for years in this country, while the world has witnessed the horrors that the IS is capable of inflicting in the Middle East. Therefore, urgent action is needed to address the problem of terrorist groups in Afghanistan.

This is apparent from the deterioration in public service delivery and people’s eroding confidence in the state machinery. Weakening of the state’s institutional capacity has affected the quality of advice available to governments and meant even the most well-crafted policy cannot be effectively implemented.
The increase in the size of the civil service over the years — with federal employees now around half a million — has not made it fit for purpose or produced improvements in efficiency and reskilling of personnel. It has had the opposite effect. Around 2.4m civil servants are employed in provincial governments.
Acknowledging the need for change, Prime Mi­­nister Shehbaz Sharif recently convened a meeting where he heard proposals for reform from a committee set up earlier and chaired by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal. The committee met over a dozen times and came up with recommendations for “transition to a smart civil service”, which were placed before the PM. Iqbal’s committee has now been given a month to translate these into an action plan for the PM’s approval.
Before discussing the key proposals, it is important to place this issue in its historical context. The declining capacity of the state machinery is the cumulative result of several factors. Among these, two stand out. One, postponed reforms and two, politicisation of the civil service. After independence, governance required transforming the colonial-era administrative system into one responsive to public expectations and the needs of a developing country. For decades, this task was ignored, which left the administrative system unable to meet the requirements of modern governance.
When reform was attempted in 1973, it was limited and controversial. Various government commissions and committees were set up in the 2000s and subsequently, whose recommendations were usually not implemented. At other times, ‘reform’ efforts took the form of isolated steps in select areas and not what was needed to make the civil service competent and people-friendly. Patchwork measures instituted from time to time tinkered with the system and fell short of a transformational overhaul of the civil service. No provincial government even undertook such an endeavour.

A systemic problem needs a systemic response and not patchwork reform.

Meanwhile, politicisation of the bureaucratic and police cadres from the 1970s onwards distorted their functioning and entailed a number of damaging consequences — undermining of efficiency, erosion of authority and draining of morale. It also meant the civil service ceased to attract the best and the brightest as it once did. Merit and professionalism were cast aside by both military and civilian governments in manipulating the state machinery for political ends. They failed to see this would ultimately leave governments with less rather than more control.
 
 

It is against this backdrop that the government is contemplating reform on the basis of around 50 recommendations from the Iqbal committee. These focus on areas of recruitment, training, performance management, institutional restructuring and compensation. The proposal for greater specialisation in the civil service is a welcome one. Downsizing is missing from the top recommendations except a passing mention of the need to implement those made by another committee.
The main recommendation is the establishment of a ‘National Executive Service’ to provide for lateral entry by opening a certain percentage of senior posts at Grade 20 or above to experts in different areas from outside the civil service.
It is unclear whether NES would have both lateral entrants and career civil servants. The last time lateral entry was attempted was in 1973, with mixed results. There is little doubt that professional talent inducted from outside can inject fresh ideas, encourage innovation and bring specialised expertise to a ‘closed service’.
But if one of the aims of reform is to end the ‘elitist’ nature of the higher civil service, the proposed NEC risks setting up another elite cadre akin to the Pakistan Administrative Service and the District Management Group. Creation of another service may raise both administrative and legal issues that would have to be resolved. Perhaps lateral inductions of professionals can be done while avoiding these problems, especially the risk of politicisation to ensure candidates are not selected on political criteria. The ‘competitive and transparent process’ promised by the proposal will need to be rigorously enforced.
Instead of creating a new separate service, the government could consider identifying select ministries where outside expertise and specialisation are sorely needed and initially open these to lateral entry above grade 19. Induction should be through the Federal Public Service Commission. It would be important to ensure representation of all provinces in lateral entry inductions to preserve the federal character of the service.
Downsizing the civil service is not addressed by the reform package but is essential for reform. A bloated bureaucracy is not just a drain on the exchequer but also contributes to its dysfunctionality. No serious effort has been made in the past to ‘rightsize’ the government.
There are several ways to do this. Reduce the tiers in the bureaucratic hierarchy, merge divisions which have proliferated and abolish posts lying vacant for over three years. Another way is to ensure federal and provincial expenditures are strictly aligned with constitutional mandates, which will both save money and reduce personnel.
The reform proposals do not deal with provincial and local government structures. Yet service delivery takes place at the local and provincial level. Excluding them in the reform effort means overlooking the crucial coordination the federal government maintains with them. Meaningful reform to improve service delivery means it has to be comprehensive with a whole-of-government vision. Strong local government institutions are essential for effective service delivery. Officials argue provincial and local government structures are the purview of provincial governments. But that doesn’t mean reform suggestions cannot be made to them to consider.
Comprehensive reform should involve the following interlinked aspects: fundamental changes in recruitment and training to meet today’s governance needs, professionalising the service by acquisition of specialised skills and technological know-how, incentivising performance by clear criteria, spelling out measurable deliverables, streamlining decision-making processes for quicker decisions, merit-based promotions and weeding out deadwood and poor performers by severance packages. It is yet to be seen how far the government’s final reform proposals meet these requirements. A systemic problem needs a systemic response.

• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’
FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.
The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.
Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.
A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently perished after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).
“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told Dawn.
He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.
These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.
His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.
“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.
He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.
László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara lost his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.
At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.
New challenges
“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.
High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.
Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.
“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told Dawn that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.
He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.
This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.
Distressing situation
Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.
“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.
He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.
A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.
Livelihoods in danger
As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.
Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.

The results based on a survey of more than 1,100 leaders from government, industry, civil society and academia across 136 countries, paints a stark picture of mounting vulnerabilities that threaten to overwhelm international institutions and destabilise societies.
Environmental risks, including climate change inaction, large-scale pollution, and biodiversity loss, dominate the list of concerns, with the report warning that these crises are both highly likely and potentially catastrophic.
Yet, the report also highlights a worrying lack of preparedness for emerging threats such as space-based events, pandemics, and the rapid advance of frontier technologies.
The report concludes with a call from UN secretary-general for the immediate creation of a task team to strengthen the organisation’s capacity to address risks in the information ecosystem.

Environmental challenges and disinformation top list of vulnerabilities

The UN Department of Global Communications has already begun work to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the delivery of the UN’s mandate. The report’s authors warn that global vulnerabilities are being exacerbated by weak governance, a lack of political consensus, and the erosion of state sovereignty.
“One thing is clear when looking out on this landscape of global risk: ultimate responsibility lies with today’s leaders,” UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said.
“They face a stark choice: breakdown, or break through to a better tomorrow — one in which we all live in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet.”
The survey found that multilateral institutions are least prepared to address five critical risks: outer space, cybersecurity breakdowns, the proliferation of non-state actors, mis- and disinformation, and the erosion of state sovereignty.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

Pakistan won the series opener by 14 runs but dropped the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.
 






Pakistan went 189 for four as Farhan hammered the hosts for 74 runs on 53 balls, smashing five sixes and three fours, while Ayub lasted 19 overs, finishing on 66 from 49 balls with two sixes and four fours.
Farhan was caught by West Indies captain Shai Hope at long off from a delivery by Shamar Joseph on the second ball of the 17th over.
Hasan Nawaz entered but was retired after only 15 runs, caught by Romario Shepherd at long off from a delivery by Roston Chase on the penultimate ball of the 18th over.
Mohammad Haris was run out for only two runs by Gudakesh Motie to start the 19th over and Ayub finally exited on the last ball of the penultimate over,
Jason Holder’s delivery grabbed by Sherfane Rutherford at sweeper cover.
Set 190 to win, West Indies struck for 30 runs on the first 10 balls from Hasan Ali and Mohammad Nawaz.
Jewel Andrew was caught by Hasan Ali at long on, bowled by Haris Rauf for 24, the first West Indies wicket falling at 44.
Ayub caught Hope bowled out by Nawaz for seven in the ninth over with the hosts still 116 runs from victory.
Alick Athanaze lasted 13 overs before being taken for 60, caught by Khushdil Shah bowled by Ayub with West Indies on 110, needing 80 runs off the last 42 deliveries.
Chase was retired on the last ball of the 17th over and his replacement, last-ball hero Holder from the win a night earlier, was bowled out by Sufiyan Muqeem two balls later for a duck, leaving the hosts 41 runs shy with 16 balls remaining.
Rutherford smashed a six to reach a half-century with seven balls remaining before exiting on 51 as West Indies couldn’t pull off another last-over comeback.</p><small>2025-08-04 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0408410884da543.jpg?r=084114' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928547/v8-nations-aim-to-boost-oil-output-by-05m-barrels' target='_blank'><strong>V8 nations aim to boost oil output by 0.5m barrels</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: The Voluntary Eight (V8) — Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Russia — announced on Sunday they would increase oil production by 547,000 barrels a day in a move that analysts say aims to regain market share amid resilient crude prices.
As currently they produce about 41 to 42 million barrels a day, the increase would be about 1.5 per cent, though analysts believe with the Brent reference oil currently selling at about $70 a barrel, there is unlikely to be a major impact on prices.
“The eight participating countries will implement a production adjustment of 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025 from August 2025 required production level,” said a statement released after a meeting where the hike was agreed upon.
The eight key producers, which started increasing production in April, affirmed their commitment to market stability on “current healthy oil market fundamentals”, an Opec statement read.

1.5pc hike unlikely to have major impact on prices, analysts say

Oil prices have held up better than observers anticipated amid strong summer demand and a high geopolitical risk premium, notably owing to conflict between Iran and Israel.
“Opec+ has passed the first test — unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day (since April) without crashing prices or compromising unity,” said Jorge Leon, analyst at Rystad Energy. But the next task would be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion, Leon said.
Low oil inventories
The post-meeting statement said the decision came “in view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.” The Opec+ countries agreed in December to start a gradual return from last April of the 2.2 million barrels per day of previous production cuts.
The latest move, a year ahead of an initial 18-month schedule, completes the unwinding and also provides for a 300,000 barrels per day tranche granted specifically to the United Arab Emirates.
The statement added that the phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions. The eight added that they will hold monthly meetings for a regular review of market conditions. For now, the return of other production cuts is to be discussed at the next Opec+ ministerial meeting at the end of November, with all 22 members.
Opec said the V8 will first meet on September 7.
In a bid to boost prices, the wider Opec+ group — comprising the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies — in recent years had agreed to three different tranches of output cuts, amounting to almost six million bpd in total.
Market experts warn that forecasting is particularly challenging given the uncertainty emanating from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs policy and its effects on global trade, as well as his 10-day deadline for Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

• Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir publicly conducts Jewish prayer in Al-Aqsa compound, sparking outrage
CAIRO: At least 46 deaths, including six from starvation or malnutrition, were reported in Gaza over the past 24 hours, local health authorities said on Sunday.
The health ministry said that six more Palestinians died of starvation or malnutrition while 40 killed in Israeli gunfire and airstrikes across the coastal enclave.
Deaths included persons trying to make their way to aid distribution points in southern and central areas of Gaza, Palestinian medics said.
Among those killed was a staff member of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, which said an Israeli strike at their headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza ignited a fire on the first floor of the building.
The new hunger-related deaths raised the toll of those dying from what international humanitarian agencies say may be an unfolding famine to 175, including 93 children, since the war began, the ministry said.
 
 

Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said two trucks carrying 107 tons of diesel were set to enter Gaza, months after Israel severely restricted aid access to the enclave before easing it somewhat as starvation began to spread.
COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said later in the day that four tankers of UN fuel had entered to help in operations of hospitals, bakeries, public kitchens and other essential services.
There was no immediate confirmation whether the two diesel fuel trucks had entered Gaza from Egypt.
Gaza’s health ministry has said fuel shortages have severely impaired hospital services, forcing doctors to focus on treating only critically ill or injured patients.
Prayer in Al-Aqsa
According to AFP, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir publicly conducted on Sunday a Jewish prayer on the Al-Aqsa compound in east Jerusalem — a highly contentious move that violates a long-held understanding at the site.
Jewish religious rituals are prohibited there by a long-standing agreement between Israel and Jordan, custodian of the site.
Ben Gvir’s Sunday visit however marked the first time a prayer was publicly recited by a government minister, according to Israeli media.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement saying that “Israel’s policy of maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed and will remain unchanged”.
‘Airdrops are insufficient’
UN agencies say airdrops are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and open up access to the territory to prevent starvation among its 2.2 million people, most of whom are displaced amidst vast swathes of rubble.
 
 

Meanwhile, Belgium’s air force dropped the first in a series of its aid packages into Gaza on Sunday in a joint operation with Jordan, the Belgian defence ministry said.
France on Friday started to air-drop 40 tons of humanitarian aid.
Looted aid trucks
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said on Sunday that nearly 1,600 aid trucks had arrived since Israel eased restrictions late in July. However, witnesses and Hamas sources said many of those trucks have been looted by desperate displaced people and armed gangs.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to give humanitarian assistance to the hostages during a conversation with the head of the Swiss-based ICRC’s local delegation.

The party leaders, a maj­ority of whom are in Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), have decided to att­end parliamentary sessions after getting relief from courts.
The Leader of the Opposition in National Ass­e­mbly, Omar Ayub Khan, told Dawn that all legal options would be used to get relief and till that time he and other leaders including Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza and Zartaj Gul Wazir would not attend sessions of the National Assembly and Senate.
“I have asked my lawyer Babar Awan to complete documentation and file a case. Other leaders will also do the same,” he said.
When asked in which courts, application for bails and stay orders would be filed, Omar Ayub said that applications would be filed in different courts. However, he made it clear that they would not come in public before getting bails.
Last week, Omar  Ayub refused to meet the CJP on Supreme Court premises, or in Islamabad, citing the possibility of his arrest due to warrants issued against him. Replying to a question, he said that MNA Abdul Lateef has already sought a stay order and the same will be done by other leaders.
The Peshawar High Court last week stopped the Election Commission of Pakistan from proceeding further on de-notifying a PTI MNA from Chitral Abdul Lateef and declaring his seat vacant.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal issued notices to respondents including ECP and the National Assembly speaker seeking their response to a petition filed by MNA Abdul Lateef challenging the order of the ECP of disqualifying him and subsequent notification of declaring his seat vacant by de-notifying him as an MNA on July 29, 2025. The bench fixed Aug 20 for next hearing of the petition.
Mr Ayub Khan and other PTI leaders, who have been sentenced 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots, have been hoping to get a similar relief.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting against the arrest of party founder Imran Khan, had staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including PTI leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers, 108 have been sentenced by the court. PTI’s MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, MNA Zain Qureshi, and former party leader Fawad Chaudhry were acquitted in the cases.

• Dar welcomes ‘positive momentum’ towards free trade agreement
• Iranian president meets Zardari, army chief before wrapping up his two-day visit
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Sunday agreed that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism, as both countries renewed their commitment to increase annual bilateral trade to $10 billion.
The consensus was rea­ched during a bilateral meeting at the Prime Mini­ster’s House in Islamabad and later emphasised at a joint press conference by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian Presi­dent Masoud Pezeshkian. “The development of economic and trade ties will be achieved through peace, stability, and tranquillity,” Mr Pezeshkian said, underscoring that terrorism remains a key obstacle to mutual prosperity.
“Given the threats from terrorist groups in border areas, both sides emphasised the need to increase cooperation to ensure border security and safeguard the peace and well-being of citizens in border cities,” the Iranian president added.
The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained ties.
PM Shehbaz acknowledged that security was paramount for progress in bilateral relations. “There will be zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism. If anyone falls victim to terrorism in Iran, it is the same as someone being affected by terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
“For peace and development in our region, and along our hundreds of kilometres-long shared border, we must cooperate against terrorism and take effective steps to eliminate the scourge of terrorism once and for all,” the PM added.
While the two leaders voiced their commitment to deepening cooperation, specific operational details were reportedly discussed in President Pezeshkian’s meeting with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Neither side issued a state­ment on the meeting by the time of publication.
Later in the evening, Mr Pezeshkian met senior Pakistani military leaders, including Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik at the presidency before the dinner reception hosted by President Asif Ali Zardari. A naval representative was also in attendance.

$10 billion trade target
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to raising annual bilateral trade to $10 billion — a target first set during the late Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to Pakistan in April 2024.
“We can easily, in a short time, increase the volume of trade from the current $3 billion to the projected goal of $10 billion,” Mr Pezeshkian said during the joint media conference.
PM Shehbaz echoed the sentiment. “We also jointly hope that the $10bn trade target is achieved at the earliest,” he said.
Official estimates place current bilateral trade at approximately $2.8bn.
Trade has been constrained by a range of factors, including international sanctions on Iran, security concerns along the border, inadequate infrastructure, and limited economic complementarity.
Diplomatic and political fluctuations, often shaped by broader geopolitical tensions, have also affected the implementation of trade agreements.
While neither leader offered a clear roadmap to resolve these issues, both underscored a shared political will to continue engaging on them.
“Our delegations will take these discussions forward very soon,” the PM said.
Earlier, at the bilateral talks, he had emphasised the need to convene the long-delayed 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission at the earliest. The 21st meeting of the Commission was held in 2022.
Proposals discussed during the talks included facilitating barter trade, increasing export quotas for rice, fruits, and meat, operationalising cross-border markets, and removing trade barriers.
Border market development remains a key focus. Although the two countries agreed several years ago to establish six such markets, only three have become operational so far.
“The development of transit routes – railway routes and sea routes – the expansion and equipping of border markets, the facilitation of trade, and the establishment of joint free economic zones are critical needs in the relationship between the two countries, and we had constructive discussions on these issues,” Mr Pezeshkian said.
Among the documents exchanged after Sunday’s talks was a “joint ministerial statement on the intent to finalise (the) Free Trade Agreement.”
On the sidelines of the visit, a business forum was also held.
Speaking at the event, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar welcomed the “positive momentum” toward finalising the FTA, calling it a potential catalyst for strengthening bilateral trade.
12 agreements and MoUs
Pakistan and Iran signed and exchanged 12 agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to enhance cooperation across a broad spectrum of areas. The documents covered trade, transit, science and technology, tourism, agriculture, cultural exchange, maritime safety, and judicial cooperation.
The agreements include collaboration on plant quarantine, joint use of the Mirjaveh-Taftan border crossing, ICT, tourism cooperation for 2025-27, and a joint ministerial statement on finalising a Free Trade Agreement.
“We reached agreements in political, economic, commercial, and cultural fields, and signed documents to facilitate and promote cooperation in commerce, culture, tourism, transportation, and scientific and educational exchanges,” Mr Pezeshkian said.
He left for Iran after the reception at the Presidency.

The Safe City project is a government programme aimed at boosting public safety through the establishment of a high-quality surveillance system.
CCTV camera surveillance is often seen as beneficial to law enforcement agencies in their fight against crime. It can act as a deterrent, enhance investigations and provide evidence in prosecutions.
The Safe City surveillance system is also useful for monitoring public spaces, traffic police performance, important roadways, real-time incident reporting and essential infrastructure.
 

OfficialS of Dolphin Force, CCD, Traffic Police, Rescue 1122 and fire department monitor from the dispatch control and command room.

Under the project, cameras will be installed at 359 locations to cover key sites such as major roads, markets, public areas, entry and exit points of the city, government installations, VVIP routes and other important road intersections.So far, 1,700 CCTV cameras have been installed in different parts of the garrison city.
A central control room has been set up at the Safe City Headquarters Complex. The basement, ground floor and first floor of the building have already been completed. However, finishing work is currently underway and is expected to be officially completed before December 2025, the deadline for the project’s completion. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Safe City Rawalpindi Region, Rana Abdul Wahab, told Dawn that a total of 2,097 high-resolution CCTV cameras will be installed at 359 key locations across the city.
Around 1,700 cameras have already been installed in market areas, crossing points, and at government installations. The remaining cameras will become active by the end of this month, he added. Of the total CCTV cameras, 15 have been installed at the entry and exit points of Rawalpindi.
He added that “panic buttons” will also be installed at major intersections, market areas, and other important locations, allowing citizens to instantly communicate with the PSCA during emergency situations. Provision of Wi-Fi at 150 spots in Rawalpindi is also part of the PSCA, SSP Wahab said.
The Safe City Headquarters Complex houses the Central Command, Control and Communication System, Dispatch Control Room, Commander Room, and Digital Forensic Room. All Safe City projects established in the Rawalpindi Region are connected with the SC Headquarters in Lahore.
 

A total of 2,097 CCTV cameras will be installed at 359 sites including 15 entry and exit points.

This project will improve overall governance and boost public trust in law enforcement agencies, said the SSP, adding that the Safe City projects are linked to the PSCA headquarters in Lahore.
He said that representatives of the Dolphin Force, Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP), City Traffic Police, Crime Control Department (CCD), Fire Department, Rescue 1122, Women Police, Child Protection Department, CTD and regular police are stationed at the Safe City Project to monitor activities in the district and promptly decide on strategies for quick action.
The SSP said that through high-speed recognition of individuals and vehicles, photographs and other particulars of any suspect on the wanted list of the police, CTD, CCD, or any law enforcement agency will be inserted into the Safe City data system.

Data on stolen vehicles will also be uploaded, helping police arrest suspects anywhere in the province. However, he said that once a suspect has been apprehended, their name would be deleted from the system.
Responding to a question regarding concerns about the potential misuse of surveillance technology and its impact on privacy and civil liberties, SSP Wahab said that the Safe City authorities will strictly follow SOPs.
No one will have access to the recorded videos except authorised police officials, and only with official permission, as the footage is admissible in court, he said.
The SSP further revealed that no one has access to edit or delete the Safe City video footage, and it is stored for a long period. “Nobody has so far claimed that any Safe City video was unreal or fabricated,” he said.
E-challan on the cards
The Punjab Safe City Authority is set to launch online payment of e-challans for 19 traffic violations, which will be monitored by PSCA cameras. According to officials, the system will eliminate the chance of disputing traffic violations. Citizens will be able to pay e-challans online using the Punjab e-pay app on their phones.
SSP Rana Abdul Wahab said that 173 CCTV cameras have also been installed in Murree at 35 locations, along with six panic buttons and Wi-Fi facilities at five different spots.

Likewise, the Safe City Project has also started in Taxila with the installation of 93 CCTV cameras at 23 sites. Additionally, 10 panic buttons have been installed at various locations to allow the public to communicate immediately with the PSCA during emergencies, along with Wi-Fi facilities at 19 points.
The project will also include one drone, two air quality monitoring devices, and 20 cell phones. The Safe City project is designed to assist police in crime prevention and investigation support. It is expected to not only prevent crime but also lead to higher conviction rates.

• Pakistan-India largely ‘de-hyphenated’, but analysts warn against putting too much faith in transactional relationship based on minerals, crypto cooperation
OF LATE, it seems that Islamabad and Washington are in lockstep. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an IS-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president’s day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’.
After securing what seems to be a major discount in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor interest in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned.
While this may seem like a turning of the tide to the casual observer, the fact of the matter is that Pakistan-US relations have gone through several crests and troughs in their several decade-long history.
But while the nature of the relationship has been cyclical, it is no coincidence that the current regime has been able to find a soft corner with the Trump administration. This, seasoned observers would argue, is a well-choreographed change that has been in the works for some time now.
 
 

According to Shuja Nawaz, founding director of the South Asia Centre at the Atlantic Council, the spike is not so sudden at all.
“It has been building via the military-to-military relationship on counterterrorism and likely covert aid, as well as provision of access to US aircraft and drones to monitor activities in the region,” he said.
Michael Kugelman, a former director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre, also sees it as the continued results of “Islamabad’s successful attempts to get the attention of a relentlessly transactional administration”.
However, even he warns against viewing this “renaissance in ties” as something that has “long-term potential”, as policies tend to change from administration to administration, and sometimes, even midstream.
The latest manifestation of the newfound warmth can be seen in an upcoming parliamentary visit: the largest-ever Senate delegation from Pakistan is set to visit the US later this month.
The delegation, led by Deputy Senate Chairman Syedaal Khan Nasar, is scheduled to visit from Aug 12 to 20. It will include chairpersons of major Senate standing committees on Finance, Health, Interior, Cabinet Secretariat, Human Rights and Maritime Affairs.
Background discussions with diplomats in the US capital indicated that efforts were also underway to arrange a reciprocal visit by US lawmakers to Pakistan, aiming to deepen legislative-level ties and sustain the momentum generated in recent months.
During their US tour, Pakistani senators will visit Washington, Chicago, New Jersey, and New York, meeting with members of Congress, senior officials, business leaders, and diaspora representatives. The visit will culminate in the US-Pakistan Strategic Forum on Capitol Hill, scheduled for Aug 20 at the Rayburn House Office Building.
In any case, the US president is also bound to run into PM Shehbaz Sharif in New York, when the latter attends the 80th UN General Assembly session in September.
De-hyphenating India-Pakistan
So what does this mean? Islamabad sees this warming of ties as an opportunity to elevate the country’s regional standing.
For their part, Pakistani officials and analysts hope that after China and India, Pakistan will now be accorded a new status as the ‘number three power’ in South Asia — one that reflects its strategic relevance and potential.
They also expect political and economic support from Washington to help secure this position, and hope that any new regional role will be acceptable to both the United States and China.
In May, Pakistan’s army chief met President Trump at the White House. This was followed by a series of cabinet-level engagements, culminating in a breakthrough tariff agreement that set a uniform duty of 19 per cent on Pakistani exports to the US.
The opportunity offered by India’s obstinacy — especially in the wake of the May flare-up with Pakistan and the eventual US-brokered de-escalation — has been fully capitalised on.
It is no secret that Donald Trump likes to blow his own horn, having claimed credit for stopping nuclear war in the Subcontinent umpteen times. But while Islamabad has welcomed his diplomatic posture, New Delhi has been reluctant to do so.
This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in recent days, the US president has taken a decidedly more hostile approach towards an otherwise leading trade partner, calling India out for trading with Russia and Iran while not dropping its tariffs.
According to Christopher Clary, a Political Science professor associated with University at Albany, “India sometimes refuses to make positive-sum compromises out of principle & Pakistan has often compromised — or at least pretended to compromise — to ensure positive ties with DC”.
Mr Kugelman also agrees that the US-India relationship “is going through some travails”.
“Pakistan getting a trade deal with the US before India makes it harder for Washington and New Delhi to regain equilibrium,” he notes.
Mr Nawaz also agrees, noting that India’s massive trade surplus with the US could become a liability under Trump.
According to him, Pakistan should be grateful that the US has largely de-hyphenated India-Pakistan relations in policy implementation. But both nations will now face their own set of challenges as Washington redefines its economic and strategic alignments.
Transactional relationship
The transactional nature of the new Pakistan-US relationship is also apparent. At a recent international minerals conference in Islamabad, the US sent three separate delegations — from the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Commerce — underscoring the strategic importance Washington now attaches to Pakistan’s untapped natural resources.
According to Mr Kugelman, “Pakistan has managed to present itself as a well-positioned partner to deliver on the issues that interest the administration the most—crypto, critical minerals, and cooperation to track down terrorists that threaten the US.”
 
 

But, as he points out, Pakistan’s critical minerals are mostly found in highly insecure areas. “This administration could well lose interest and move on. It’s nothing if not fickle.”
Mr Nawaz, meanwhile, says that Pakistan “will have to be creative about how it brings its $3 billion surplus to zero”, perhaps by buying US technology and services or offering access to rare earth minerals in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan. “The question is how it will finance those investments without upsetting China or Iran,” he notes.

While Comsats currently has a temporary rector, the position at IIUI remains vacant. Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, who had been looking after the affairs of IIUI in his capacity as chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC), completed his term on July 29 and is no longer serving as the rector.
The Ministry of Science and Technology is the line ministry for Comsats, while the Ministry of Federal Education supervises IIUI.
The post of Comsats rector has been vacant since July 2023, following the resignation of Dr Mohammad T. Afzal. Subsequently, the university’s chancellor - the then president Dr Arif Alvi - assigned the look-after charge to Senior Dean Prof Dr Sajid Qamar, who continues to serve in that capacity on an ad-hoc basis. Several other key positions at Comsats, including the registrar’s office, are also being run on a temporary basis.

Posts at public sector universities fell vacant in 2023 and since then permanent heads could not be appointed

Similar is the situation at the IIUI. The post became vacant in November 2023 after the Supreme Court removed then rector Dr Samina Malik and directed that the HEC chairman or a permanent HEC member nominated by him would oversee the rector’s responsibilities until a regular appointment was made.
Following the directive, then HEC chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed assumed additional charge as the IIUI rector. However, with the completion of his term on July 29, the university is again without a rector. Although the prime minister assigned the secretary federal education the additional charge of HEC chairman for three months or until a regular appointment, no steps have been taken to fill the IIUI rector position.
“As of today, there is no rector in our university,” said an IIUI official.
A senior officer from the Ministry of Education claimed that the process was underway to assign the charge of the rector to someone soon. However, university officials have voiced concern over why the position has remained vacant since October last year despite the court’s directive.
Meanwhile, the issue of Comsats’ rector has seen even longer delays. In September 2023, following a competitive selection process, a panel of three candidates was submitted to the President’s Office for final approval. After thorough consideration, President Asif Ali Zardari in his capacity as the Comsats Chancellor approved the appointment of Dr Shahid Munir with the Ministry of Science and Technology issuing a notification on September 23, 2024.
However, Dr Munir did not take charge as Comsats rector as he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, on the same day. Since then, the matter has remained unresolved.
According to a Comsats official, the issue is likely to be resolved soon, as the university’s senate, its supreme decision-making body, was expected to meet in the third week of August to deliberate on the appointment.

Mr Niazi was taken into custody near the shrine of Baba Shadi Shaheed in Bhimber district while returning from Samahni to Bhimber city—constituency of incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq—to lead another rally as part of PTI’s mobilisation campaign for the August 5 protests, called by the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi had spent Saturday night in Mirpur but, anticipating his arrest, left his accommodation via a back exit and used someone else’s vehicle to reach Samahni.
There, he led a rally from Pir Galli to Samahni from 2pm to 4pm, urging people to participate in large numbers in the upcoming protest against both the “unlawful arrest” of Mr Khan and India’s abrogation of occupied Jammu and Kashmir’s special status six years ago.
According to Mr Niazi’s press secretary, Habib Ahmed, a large contingent of police led by SSP Mirpur Khurram Iqbal intercepted his entourage and detained him.
Mr Niazi was among several PTI leaders—including former President Dr Arif Alvi—who were booked on November 24 last year at Karachi Company police station in Islamabad under seven sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, two provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, and one clause of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance.
His nephew, Advocate Sardar Moteeb, told Dawn that Mr Niazi had secured protective bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.
“Despite this, Islamabad police had new arrest warrants issued based on additional charges,” he said.
Eyewitnesses said that apart from AJK policemen, the arresting party included nearly 20 plainclothed officials, reportedly from Islamabad police.
However, DIG Mirpur region Dr Liaqat Ali clarified to Dawn that Mr Niazi was taken into custody on the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
“Given his health condition, he has been kept at the Industrial Area rest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail by the deputy commissioner,” he added.
The DIG also rejected reports that two PTI activists accompanying Mr Niazi were also arrested.
Soon after news of Mr Niazi’s arrest spread across the region, PTI workers staged protest demonstrations in various areas, blocking roads and burning tyres.
Meanwhile, in a statement issued from the United States, where he is currently on a private visit, PTI regional information secretary and former minister Chaudhry Maqbool Gujjar condemned what he called the “uncalled-for arrest” of Mr Niazi on “frivolous charges,” accusing Prime Minister Haq of betrayal.
“Anwarul Haq owes his return to the AJK Assembly after a decade to PTI’s platform and Imran Khan’s personal campaigning. It’s shameful that the same man is now ordering crackdowns on party workers who are peacefully demanding Khan Sahib’s release,” he said.

On the other hand, the railways has earned a record revenue of over Rs7.48bn in the first month (July) of the ongoing fiscal year 2025-26. The revenue is Rs1.46bn more than the July of the last fiscal, Dawn has learnt.
“During the last couple of fiscal years, we did a lot of repair work at the railway track in Sukkur division—the most troubled area in terms of decaying railway track. Due to massive works, wherein we even replaced various decaying stretches of the track (ML-1) with new ones, the number of derailments declined. Now the track in Sukkur division has improved compared to the past,” PR Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch explained by phone when asked why the PR was not focusing on the track rehabilitation.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, he said that despite meager financial resources, the PR has improved its passenger and freight train operations and other revenue streams. Under the federal government’s Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the FY 2025-26, Rs22bn has been given to the railways. Of these, Rs12bn would be spent only on the infrastructure-related projects including tracks’ rehabilitation and repair of signaling and communication systems.

Targets Rs100bn revenue by the end of fiscal in June next year

Mr Baloch said the PR had succeeded in massively decreasing its dependency on the federal government as the department was meeting most of its expenses with its own financial resources.
“We didn’t get even a single penny from the federal government for refurbishment of passengers coaches, turning Lahore and other major railway stations into modern ones having escalators, state of the art toilets, washrooms, waiting rooms, dining rooms, dining on wheels, provision of WiFi service in trains, vigilance, online booking, track tracking and several other developments,” Mr Baloch said, adding that the number of accidents caused by derailments were declining fast compared to the situation with previous years.
Talking about income of the railways, the CEO said: “while July 2025-26 figure shows that revenue earned this month was Rs1.46bn more than the last year’s July,by end of the ongoing fiscal year on June 30 next year, the department is most likely to touch a figure of Rs100bn”.
 
 

It is pertinent to mention that in the last fiscal that ended on June 30, the railways had earned Rs93bn that included Rs47bn and Rs31bn from passenger and freight trains, respectively. Rs1.5bn were earned through military goods operation through rail, Rs3bn from other coaches’ operations and Rs9bn from other miscellaneous resources.
In the year 2023-24, the PR had earned Rs88bn revenue, Rs15bn more than the target. In 2018-19, the PR’s total income touched the figure of Rs45bn that increased to Rs48.5bn in 2020-21 and Rs63.5bn in 2022-23 fiscal years.
In 2024-25, the railways Karachi division remained on top in passenger revenue with Rs15bn, followed by Lahore with over Rs11bn. In the freight sector, the Karachi division topped with a record earning of Rs28bn, followed by Multan division that earned Rs1bn.
“Though we are already doing our best to improve our operations and revenues, we aim to make our train operations safer and more comfortable for the passengers,” the railways CEO claimed.

They were addressing a joint press conference in their newly-established district office in Shahmansoor Town here on Sunday flanked by various other leaders of the party.
Mr Qaiser said: “With the August 5 rally, we are launching a movement for the release of our leader, securing the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in the country.”
Tarakai said: “The central and provincial leaders and the allied partners have decided that this time, there will be various protests. This is a movement and we will continue it till achieving our goals.”

Qaiser, Tarakai ask govt not to allow military operations in merged areas

He said: “We will not allow military operations in the merged districts in any way. The provincial government should implement Imran Khan’s orders in this regard. We want education and business instead of guns, and we also want good trade relations with Afghanistan.”
He said that August 5 would be observed as a black day, marking the two years since the incarceration of Imran Khan.
He claimed that according to the Constitution, if a person’s case was not decided within a year, then he should be released on bail after that period, but regretted that Imran was being kept behind bars ‘unjustifiably’.
“We want an open trial of Imran Khan and other PTI leaders and workers in the presence of the media in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding, ‘when the judge is yours, the witness is yours, and the testimony is yours, then we don’t accept it’.
Tarakai called for the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the incidents of May 9, with a view to identifying those responsible and ensuring accountability under the law of the land. He said that after the 26th Amendment, judiciary no longer remained independent.
He said that the federal government was responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the merged districts.
The two leaders admitted that there were internal differences in PTI but declared it part of the democratic process and beauty of democracy, claiming that PTI’s leaders and workers followed Imran Khan’s directives.
“Despite all the difficulties, obstacles, internal differences and the punishment of our leaders, PTI leaders and workers will reach Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday,” said Mr Qaiser.
“We are focused on Tuesday’s gathering, which will prove a milestone in securing the release of the party founder,” he said.
Mr Qaiser and Mr Tarakai said though their arrest warrants had been issued they were not afraid of such tactics by the hybrid government, which had ‘stolen’ the PTI’s mandate.
“We have completed our homework for the Lahore rally and the government should not create any obstacles in the way of peaceful protests,” said Qaiser.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.

Pakistan and Iran vowed to further expand their land and rail route linkages. 
The two sides made these commitments when Iranian Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh, who accompanied the Iranian president on the official visit to Pakistan, participated in the joint meeting held with federal ministers Abdul Aleem Khan, Jam Kamal Khan, and Hanif Abbasi.
According to an official press release, the discussions focused on strengthening the longstanding friendly and bilateral relations between the two countries, particularly by enhancing transportation, connectivity network and road infrastructure.
During the meeting, interest was expressed by Iran in joining the Silk Road initiative with Pakistan and China and discussed expanding of maritime trade via Gwadar-Chabahar route. 
Welcoming the Iranian delegation, Aleem Khan congratulated Iranian minister on Iran’s firm stand against Israel and termed it a matter of pride and solidarity for the entire Muslim World. He said that Pakistan and Iran have always stood by each other while recent regional developments have brought the two nations more close to each other.
Mr Aleem Khan invited the Iranian minister to attend the upcoming ministerial conference in Pakistan on Oct 23-24. 
Speaking on the occasion, Iranian Minister Farzaneh Sadegh expressed her deep appreciation for Pakistan’s support against Israeli aggression and extended sentiments of goodwill to the people of Pakistan.

Harry Brook and Joe Root shared a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 195 to put England on the brink of completing a record run chase that would have given them a 3-1 series win.
With India on the ropes, however, and England needing only another 73 runs, Brook played a wild stroke and skied a catch to depart for 111.
That gave India a chink of hope and they certainly made the most of it.
Jacob Bethell also fell to a rash shot for five and Root, having completed a masterful 39th test century, nicked a catch to wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel off Prasidh Krishna to spark wild Indian celebrations.
In mounting tension, Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton struggled to get bat on ball, surviving several frenzied appeals before the umpires decided it was too dark to continue.
The players left the field and shortly afterwards, a heavy rain shower made conditions unplayable, depriving the crowd of a tense finale to a day of unremitting drama.
Gripping series
England will resume on 339-6 on Monday, with Chris Woakes unlikely to bat due to a broken shoulder, and India still in with a chance of a victory that would earn them a share of a gripping five-match series.
India had the better of the morning session after England resumed on 50-1, dismissing Ben Duckett for 54 and Ollie Pope for 27 to leave the hosts wobbling on 106-3.
Brook, on 19, was lucky to survive when Mohammed Siraj caught him in the deep before stepping back on to the boundary cushion.
The prolific right-hander made him pay a heavy price for the error, striking two sixes and 12 fours all round the ground to reach his 10th test century off 91 balls.
Root provided the perfect foil, continuing his consistent form throughout the series, as the Indian bowlers struggled to get much movement under grey skies.
Once past three figures, Brook launched an all-out attack, hitting Akash Deep for two fours in an over before attempting a third and Siraj completed the catch on this occasion.
Brook’s bat flew out of his hands as he played the stroke and he had to retrieve it before returning to the pavilion to a standing ovation from the crowd.
He probably believed he had done enough to ensure victory for his team, but India had other ideas.
The highest successful run chase at The Oval was England’s 263-9 against Australia in 1902.</p><small>2025-08-03 18:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03224135fe75293.jpg?r=231250' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928508/indian-army-officer-booked-for-assaulting-staff-at-srinagar-airport-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Indian army officer booked for assaulting staff at Srinagar Airport: local media</strong></a><br><p>An Indian army officer on Sunday was booked for allegedly assaulting four airport employees at Srinagar Airport on July 26 after they asked him to pay an excess baggage fee, Indian outlet The Times of India (TOI) reported.

“The airline says its staff members ‘suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries’,” TOI reported.

The outlet added that the passenger was carrying two pieces of cabin luggage weighing 16 kilogrammes — more than double the allowed 7kg limit. When asked to pay a baggage fee by airline staff, he “refused and forcefully boarded the aerobridge without completing the boarding process”.
“He was escorted back to the gate by a CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) official,” TOI reported, quoting a spokesperson for Indian airline SpiceJet. “At the gate, the passenger grew increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted four members of the SpiceJet ground staff.
“One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor, but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee,” the spokesperson continued.
“Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.”
According to the spokesperson, the injured staff were rushed to the hospital, where they are still receiving treatment for their injuries.
“The matter involving an alleged altercation between an Army personnel [sic] and airline staff at Srinagar Airport on July 26 has come to the notice of the Indian Army,” TOI reported quoting a statement from the Indian military.
“The Indian Army is committed to uphold highest standards of discipline and conduct and takes all allegations seriously. Full cooperation is being extended to the authorities in investigating the case.”
Meanwhile, SpiceJet, which registered a first information report (FIR) with the local police, said it has initiated the process to put the passenger on the no-fly list.
“SpiceJet has written to the aviation ministry, appraising them about the murderous assault on its staff and has requested appropriate action against the passenger,” the airline’s spokesperson said.
“The airline has secured the CCTV footage of the incident from the airport authorities and handed it over to the police.”
According to Indian daily The Hindu, the officer, a lieutenant colonel, was nominated in an FIR registered at Budgam police station.</p><small>2025-08-03 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/032211245d9e253.jpg?r=221236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928506/imran-not-leaving-the-country-says-kp-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Imran ‘not leaving the country’, says KP CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Sunday dismissed rumours of PTI founder Imran Khan leaving the country under a deal, describing them as attempts to weaken the provincial government.
According to a statement issued today by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Niyazi, Gandapur also rubbished media reports that Imran had asked him to resign from his post as chief minister if he was unable to keep the peace in KP.
The PTI founder said in a “clear message” to Gandapur a day prior that the federation should not be allowed to conduct another military operation in the province and its tribal areas.
Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region.
“Chief Minister Gandapur has said that the PTI founder Imran Khan will never leave Pakistan,” the statement read. “If he (Imran) had to make a deal, he would have done so by now.”
The focal person’s statement added that Imran never expressed any desire to leave the country.
“The assumptions that are being made that Imran Khan will go abroad are just an attempt to weaken the movement and damage Khan’s position,” it clarified.
The statement continued: “Ali Amin Khan Gandapur said, ’Imran Khan has made me the chief minister. His trust is with me.
“Khan sahib has the government, he has the command, and we are all trying our best to deal with the challenges of the province effectively according to his vision’,”.
The statement further read: “Along with our movement, there is also an administrative responsibility, which we are paying full attention to.”
Gandapur also claimed that rumours are being spread by political opponents to weaken the PTI government in KP and the party’s movement itself.
Yesterday, the CM held the first in a series of jirgas to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
A statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.”
This development comes days before the PTI is due to launch a major protest movement across the country, to mark the second year of Imran’s incarceration in multiple cases and demand his release.</p><small>2025-08-03 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03204712ea1e35a.jpg?r=221759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928471/pakistan-iran-vow-to-further-boost-ties-during-president-pezeshkians-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran vow to further boost ties during President Pezeshkian’s visit</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari hosted Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian at the Presidency on Sunday, where they had a meeting during the latter’s two-day visit to Pakistan.
Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade.

President Zardari was quoted as saying that Pakistan and Iran enjoy brotherly relations rooted in shared religion, culture and mutual respect.
“The two leaders exchanged views on major regional and international developments and stressed the need for coordinated diplomatic efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts and to promote peace, security, and stability in the region,” the statement added.
The president appreciated Iran’s positions on regional issues and acknowledged the Islamic republic’s consistent support for regional cooperation.
He expressed gratitude for Iran’s solidarity during critical moments, such as the war with India and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to working closely with Tehran for a peaceful and prosperous future.
President Zardari also thanked Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his consistent support for the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir.
“President Zardari strongly condemned the unprovoked Israeli aggression against Iran and lauded the bravery and unity of the Iranian nation during the recent 12‑day war,” the statement added. “He expressed hope that President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit would further solidify the brotherly relations between the two countries.
“President Pezeshkian thanked the leadership and people of Pakistan for their support during the 12‑day war and appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in advocating de‑escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy for the peaceful resolution of disputes,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.
The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian addressing a joint press briefing.
“Both countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,” according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.
Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, attacked Iran’s nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.
“Israel, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.
He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.
 






PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance over Iran’s right to a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.
In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. “If anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,” he said.
The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.
The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.
In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.
He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.
“Advancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran’s foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,” he added.
The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.
President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.
The two countries aslo convened a high-level business forum in Islamabad, attended by President Pezeshkian and other senior officials, aimed at bolstering bilateral trade ties and finalising a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Iranian state-run IRNA reported.
The event, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, brought together a large number of business leaders, chamber of commerce officials, and top investors from Pakistan.
Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, delivering the opening remarks, welcomed the progress towards finalising the FTA, saying both countries are working on resolving tariff issues and enhancing border infrastructure to facilitate trade.
Speaking on the occasion, President Pezeshkian emphasised the necessity of unity and solidarity among Muslims worldwide.
“We must rely on our own capabilities and resources to overcome challenges and achieve development and progress,” he added.
Addressing the forum, Dar welcomed the positive momentum toward finalising the Pakistan-Iran FTA, according to the Foreign Office.
He emphasised that economic diplomacy is a cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy.
“The Pak-Iran FTA and platforms like the Business Forum are vital for strengthening bilateral trade and promoting collaboration across key sectors, including energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and technology,” he said.
 






12 agreements, MoUs exchanged

“The agreements and MoUs included cooperation for plant protection and plant quarantine, joint use of Mirjaveh-Taftan border gate, collaboration in science, technology and innovation, cooperation in information and communications technology,” the report said.
It added that agreements and MoUs were also exchanged to promote culture, art, tourism, youth, mass media and exports, and cooperation in meteorology, climatology and related hazards.
“MoUs on maritime safety and firefighting, judicial assistance in criminal matters, supplemental MoU to an MoU in 2013 related to air services agreement were also signed,” the report said.
The two sides also exchanged MoUs on recognition of product certification, inspection and testing, tourism cooperation for 2025-27 and a joint ministerial statement on the intent to finalise the Free Trade Agreement.
Earlier, upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s House, President Pezeshkian was presented with a guard of honour.

Dar calls on Iranian president
Previously in the day, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on President Pezeshkian and conveyed Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining “brotherly ties” with Iran, according to a statement from the Foreign Office.
 






“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.
President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.
Strengthening bilateral trade
Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.
Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.
“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”
The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.
“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.
Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.
“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.
Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.
Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.
The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.
“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.
Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.
“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot — and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.
He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the Joint Economic Commission (JEC), regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.
Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.
Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.
The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.
“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-08-03 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03212813c253794.jpg?r=212914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine' target='_blank'><strong>Top Trump aide accuses India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine</strong></a><br><p>A top aide to United States President Donald Trump on Sunday accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, after the US leader escalated pressure on New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.
“What he (Trump) said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,” said Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House and one of Trump’s most influential aides.
Miller’s criticism was some of the strongest yet by the Trump administration about one of the United States’ major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
“People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact,” Miller said on Fox News programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures’.
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian government sources told Reuters on Saturday that New Delhi will keep purchasing oil from Moscow despite US threats. A 25 per cent tariff on Indian products went into effect on Friday as a result of its purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia.
Trump has also threatened 100pc tariffs on US imports from countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.
Miller tempered his criticism by noting Trump’s relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he described as “tremendous”.</p><small>2025-08-03 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03192741d95456e.png?r=211548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928496/broken-system-experts-stress-need-for-supportive-legal-civil-forums-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Broken system’: Experts stress need for supportive legal, civil forums in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Experts from various professions assailed systemic injustice in Pakistan on Sunday, stressing the need for legal and civil institutions to be supportive and have a holistic approach.
The observations came during a plenary session of the Imagining Futures Conference, taking place at Karachi’s Habib University from August 1-4, where subject experts and stakeholders discussed human rights and civil liberties in Pakistan.
As the session, brimming with participants of all ages, began exploring Pakistan’s legal landscape, National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairperson Rabiya Javeri highlighted: “Knowledge is capital.”
However, she stressed, people should be aware of their rights but the “system is messed up”.
Responding to a query from the audience about whether knowledge really guaranteed protection if women such as ex-premier Benazir Bhutto and Noor Mukadam could be murdered, Javeri pointed out: “Empowerment through education or skills needs to be integrated into systems […] educational, financial, judicial systems have to support you.”
Only 41 per cent of women raped report it, and even out of those, they back off due to societal pressure, the NCHR chair said. Noting the low rate of conviction in rape cases (0.5pc according to a recent report), she said: “Who will they go to? System hi itna kharab hai, holnaak hai (the system itself is so broken and horrifying).”

“The system has to be responsive,” Javeri stressed, noting the need for human rights impact assessments for projects and systematic and gendered planning in budgets.
She underscored that this aspect needed to be embedded in “service providers”, which include lawyers, courts, police and teachers, among others.
“Human rights are god-given rights. Nobody can take them away.”
Javeri detailed certain cases she had come across during her role at NCHR, including one where a woman had gotten her daughter — a Master’s student in her 30s — abducted and sent to a rehabilitation centre.
The mother’s reason to do so, as told by Javeri, sent shivers down the audience’s spines: the daughter did not want to get married, had cats as pets (as if that’s somehow relevant), and a so-called doctor termed her “depressed”.
The case, Javeri noted, highlighted how ill-equipped responders and people involved in dealing with such situations are. There is a lack of regulation of mental health cases, with every other person presenting themselves as psychologists, and anybody can term someone a “paagal” (mad).
Other speakers on the panel were Police Service of Pakistan’s Superintendent (SP) Amna Baig; Karachi Bar Association Treasurer Haseebullah Panhwar; rights activist and academic Abira Ashfaq; and Air Commodore (retired) Shabbir Ahmed Khan, founder of Rashid Memorial Welfare Organisation. The session was moderated by Rana Kaiser Ishaque from the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.
SP Baig, who was among the first responders who arrested Noor Mukadam’s murderer Zahir Jaffer from the crime scene, pointed out that the case was still being discussed four years later “because she was educated”, compared to other “worse cases” she had seen while serving in Punjab.
 
 

While Baig believed that knowledge empowers people, she also noted that politicians and policymakers did not fully understand social equity.
“If culture is repressive, it will be reflected in your public service systems, such as police,” she said, explaining that approaching a police station was linked to a woman’s dignity in Pakistan.
“It’s how the police and law enforcement agencies have been portrayed over time. [But] there are women on the other side as well,” she assured the women attending the session, and suggested that it should be taught to people how to report to the police.
The police officer brought attention to a lesser-known term — tech-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) — which not only means violence done using technology but also women being killed for even using social media platforms.
An image of a young girl that most people following the news have seen popped up in the audience’s minds; the recent murder of Sana Yousaf that rightly ignited fury among women across the country.
 
 

Ashfaq, a human rights activist and an associate professor at Habib University, took aim at the 26th Amendment, noting it had snatched away the suo motu power that had allowed judges to take notice of public issues.
She also underscored the lack of legal education: “We don’t know how courts, bureaucracy and parliamentary systems function. These are basic things. We haven’t gotten out of slogans to look at economic justice, climate justice.”
“You have rolled back protective laws. We think about taxing property rather than thinking that housing is a right,” Ashfaq pointed out. Similarly, she wondered, “Where is the right to food?”
Meanwhile, Panhwar, ready with his arguments, comprehensively but succinctly listed the troubles afflicting Pakistan’s judicial system.
A serious matter, but an apt chuckle from the audience when the moderator quipped “Pakistan is also a hard state” as Panhwar described the category of local codes as “hard laws”.
The lawyer pointed out that Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution guaranteed several rights such as freedom of expression and movement, and that Pakistan was a signatory to various international conventions, but “we do not see any kind of implementation at all here”.
Without any hesitation, Panhwar called out the “ruling parties” for bringing the 26th Amendment that now gave them more votes to decide who gets to be a judge in the superior courts.
 
 

Retired Air Commodore Ahmed offered some words of wisdom, which one would want to blast on loudspeakers at public service institutions across the country.
The creation of Pakistan has given us complete independence, he said, but “we have denied and killed that over time through our actions and self-interest”.
He stressed, “If we are addressing a problem, then we must address it holistically.”
The retired officer also offered us, and Pakistan, hope: “All negative, all dark. But there is a silver lining; that we are talking about it.”</p><small>2025-08-03 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03191123bb7f192.jpg?r=202257' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928497/ex-ajk-pm-abdul-qayyum-niazi-arrested-in-bhimber-area-under-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-AJK PM Abdul Qayyum Niazi arrested in Bhimber area under MPO</strong></a><br><p>The former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, was arrested on Sunday over violations of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), a police official told Dawn.com.
Niazi in 2022 tendered his resignation from his office to defuse the move by his parliamentary party, the PTI, to replace him with regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas through a vote of no-confidence.
The MPO law in Pakistan allows authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to 90 days to prevent threats to public peace and safety.
Mirpur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Dr Liaqat Ali told Dawn.com that Niazi was arrested under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO.
“Under the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner, he was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” the DIG said.
“He is being held at the industrial area guest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail,” he said.
The Mirpur DIG added that plainclothes policemen from Islamabad came to detain the ex-PM under a first information report (FIR) — seen by Dawn.com — filed at the Karachi Company police station in the federal capital, but “we did not allow them to take him into custody”.
The FIR against Niazi in Islamabad was filed under the following sections:

109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment),
149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object)
186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions)
188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)
341 (punishment for wrongful restrain)
353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty)
395 (punishment for dacoity)
440 (mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt)
506 ii (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code

He was also booked under Sections 7 (punishment for terrorism) and 11X (responsibility for creating civil commotion) of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 8 (punishment) of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act.
DIG Dr Ali added that Niazi left Mirpur last night and headed to Bhimber to attend rallies.
Niazi’s nephew, Sardar Moteeb, said that the former PM was arrested when he was heading to Bhimber city from Samahni to attend a PTI rally related to the campaign demanding the release of party founder Imran Khan from prison.
“He was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” Moteeb said. “A team of plainclothes personnel had arrived from Islamabad to take his possessions, but local officials refused to hand them over to them and sent them back.”
Moteeb added that Niazi obtained bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.
Niazi’s press secretary, who was accompanying him at the time of the arrest, told Dawn.com that the former PM was arrested on the way to a rally and alleged that police “snatched” his mobile phone.
“Apart from Niazi, two other PTI office bearers from Kotli district, Malik Nisar and Dr Shahnawaz, were also taken into custody,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-03 16:21</small></div><hr>
