Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
After repeatedly being barred from meeting their brother, Noreen and another sister of Imran, Aleema Khan, gave separate interviews to the Indian media on the matter.
“These three sisters of Imran Ahmed Niazi sahib, on May 9 they were also present at the Core Commander’s House,” he said, but added that until now they had not been told not to “cry victimisation”.
“If you ask my legal opinion, their presence is proof … They were there on May 9, they brought groups there and it is visible in the cameras that all three are present there,” Tarar said.
“The drama being made today — there is a reason for that.”
He said that the foreign policy success after Marka-i- Haq was not being digested well by the PTI.
“In their era the economy had dipped; it is (now) moving towards an economy of stability. They are not able to digest this.”
“Why are these sisters going on Indian channels and Afghanistan’s channels and crying for their brother?” Tarar stressed. “In the interview that Noreen Khan Niazi gave to an Indian channel, did she say that she condemns Modi? Those innocent children that were martyred, did she talk about Irtaza Abbas? Did she talk about those citizens that were martyred in Muridke and Bahawalpur? Did she talk about those soldiers and young officers who were martyred? Did she pay tribute to them?”
He slammed the sisters’ actions, saying:
“Those who go on Indian channels and defame Pakistan should be ashamed of themselves.”
He added that Indian channels were providing their platform because they knew that “this family, and this party’s mindset is against Pakistan”.
He further slammed Noreen for not condemning the Hindutva ideology on the Indian channel, the cruelty against Muslims in India, or talking about the issue of India-occupied Kashmir.
“Shame on you!” the minister said with emphasis. “That you go on Indian channels and don’t talk about occupied Kashmir, Marka-i-Haq, martyrs, and you go and cry about victimisation about a prisoner who is involved in a corruption case?”
He said that the family was building “hype” in foreign media about the danger to Imran’s health, saying, “Let me assure you: he’s hale and hearty. There’s no issue. He runs every day on a treadmill for an hour.
“This kind of privileged prisoner — this kind of VVIP prisoner who enjoys five-star hotel facilities — you will not find anywhere in the world,” he said.
He added, “If only, Noreen Khan sahiba, you had gone there and talked about your martyred, about that child Irtiza Abbas. About the victory in Marka-i-Haq … if only you had paid tribute to your prime minister and chief of army staff, and condemned Modi … but for you, politics is important, defaming Pakistan is important, and personal matters are important.”
Noreen Niazi rebukes PML-N
Meanwhile, Noreen Khan criticised the ruling party, PML-N, for what she called “double standards”.
“PML-N’s double standards are staggering. They attack me for giving an interview to Indian media, yet Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, has himself used Indian platforms to malign Pakistan’s own military leadership,” she alleged, adding that today, “he and his family sit comfortably in power on the back of a blatantly manipulated mandate”.
“His brother, his daughter, and his party enjoy the perks of authority while lecturing others on ‘principles’.”
She further alleged that “elements aligned with this same power structure shamelessly doctored portions of my interview using AI, a deliberate attempt to distort my words and mislead public opinion.
“These are the same actors who have kept Imran Khan in unlawful, inhumane isolation for four weeks cut off from family, lawyers, and basic rights,” she continued her accusation, adding: “I have never held public office. My only purpose in speaking publicly is to expose the injustice of my brother’s imprisonment and to urge the human rights organisations and judiciary to recognise the systematic denial of his legal, political, and humanitarian rights.”
‘Political-terror-crime nexus’
Tarar also accused Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team of having “ties with enemies of the state”, saying it was now “out in the open”.
“Over 4,000 cases have been registered regarding the infiltration of terrorists, who are sheltered [in KP’s] areas, in three years. But, the rate of punishment is nonexistent,” he alleged. “This prosecution system is under the provincial government, which is supposed to bring in legal reforms and make it stronger.”
The minister said the KP government had been “unable to form a system to prosecute terrorists in its 12-and-a-half years in power”.
Continuing his accusations, he said: “The border is being guarded, but due to the weaknesses and failures of the district administration and provincial govt, infiltration has increased.”
Moreover, “there is a political-terror-crime nexus. The CM and his people are involved in drug trade in KP, they maintain close ties with drug lords”, Tarar alleged. “Within 12-and-a-half years, whose responsibility was it to stop drug money being used to finance terrorism?”
He claimed that the KP government’s performance was “negligible because of the political-terror-crime nexus”, under which “drug smuggling is promoted and drug money is used”.
“They (KP government) don’t punish terrorists, and of the over 10,000 cases of drug trafficking from January-August 2025, only 679 cases have been decided,” Tarar added.
“If the KP government knows of such a large drug cartel operating in its territory and cannot take action against it, that means there is a political-terror-crime nexus,” he reiterated the accusation.
Tarar further alleged that “terrorists attack state institutions but not those involved in KP’s drug trade, because doing so, they’d lose their source of financing”.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251628073602c4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957070/governing-for-population-stabilisation-and-welfare' target='_blank'><strong>Governing for population stabilisation and welfare</strong></a><br><p>Population has long been viewed as a simple denominator — a way to calculate per capita resources and economic standing. But behind the numbers lies a more urgent reality: Pakistan’s 251 million people, with an income of $1,484 per capita and a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, are on track to swell to 386m by 2050.

This rapid surge will demand far more than headline figures can capture: more safe drinking water per capita, more doctors and hospital beds per capita, more police per capita, and more schools, teachers, electricity, gas, and essential services across the board.
Development policy and governance frameworks treat population as a core management indicator for assessing various deprivations and projecting future needs for economic growth and social development. In doing so, the literature on population studies and policies draws extensively from other fields of knowledge, including cultural studies, economics, public health, and institutional coordination theories.
One of the core arguments in this literature is that effective population policies, and the governance structures needed to support better population management, emerge from at least three conditions. First, they require a broad-based consensus within state governance and policy-making systems that population growth is a central policy priority.
Second, they depend on serious investment in healthcare infrastructure to ensure the delivery of family planning services and counselling.
Third, they necessitate long-term, sustained improvements in inclusive growth, particularly in education, mobility, and employment opportunities for women.
On this scale of population governance, Pakistan offers an interesting story of the rise and fall of management policies. It was one of the first countries, back in 1958, where civil society, and then the government in 1965, started talking about population management policy and the need to make population a centre point in economic planning.
The years from 1965 to 1975 are called the first push years. However, the years 1972–1981 witnessed a population growth spurt, while there was a progressive decline in public policies around population management until the late 1980s.

         View this post on Instagram            

Population policy specialists call the 1977 to 1988 era “the lost decade.” The fertility rate started to decline ten years later than the rest of South Asia (in the 1990s), while remaining at a higher level (4.1pc) with contraceptive prevalence rate levelling off around 30pc.
However, during 1989–98, Pakistan’s population welfare policy community witnessed a resurgence in emphasis on population under various initiatives such as the Social Action Programme, the Lady Health Workers Programme, the Planning Commission’s Vision 2030, among many others.
After the 18th Amendment in 2010, population welfare has been devolved to the provincial governments along with health, education, and women’s issues.
During a recent meeting at the Planning Commission, provincial and federal governments were found discussing “fragmentation” in population planning mechanisms, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has emphasised the need for a unified national policy for population stabilisation and welfare.
Interestingly, during this period — and continuing today — South Asian states such as Bangladesh and India, as well as countries like Iran, achieved far stronger outcomes in slowing population growth. Their performance on building consensus around population measures, strengthening reproductive healthcare, and advancing women’s socio-economic status has consistently outpaced Pakistan’s.

However, Pakistan’s development paradigms could not find any substantial use of the population argument in five-year plans despite international donors and local non-governmental organisations laying emphasis on the need to do so.
At the institutional levels, the Ministry of Population Welfare and the Ministry of Health could not find a common ground, diverging from the turf war they keep fighting on various issues — healthy ageing being one of the latest.
Even the donors were not persistent in providing financial leverage to population services, and emphasis shifted to HIV/AIDS and polio eradication and other development priorities, leading to short-termism in addressing the larger population management question.
The fragmentation and inconsistency in policies and planning have led to patchy and/or near-absent institutional support to increasing contraceptive prevalence, bridging the unmet demand for child spacing services, and providing better reproductive health and mother and child healthcare services at the local levels, especially in the underserved areas.
It is sobering to note that Pakistan stands at 137 out of 166 countries on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index, with troubling indicators in maternal and child health, education, and access to clean water.
The UNDP’s 2025 Human Development Report places Pakistan in the ‘low’ human development category, assigning it an HDI score of 0.544 and ranking it 168 out of 193 countries.
The last factor in population stabilisation and population welfare is very important and forms the positive feedback loop for social and economic change, which is associated with lowering fertility rates. This factor is the social and economic change in society.
Development economists argue that with changes in social and economic conditions, such as better education and an increase in employable skills among women, improvement in physical mobility conditions for women, and job creation, marriages can be delayed and the opportunity cost of raising children increased.
So, investment in girls’ education, mobility, and better business and employment conditions can help improve prospects of population management and lower the fertility rate close to two or replacement levels. Pakistan needs to put in a great deal of effort to form and execute public policies and investment frameworks in that direction.

 

While it is heartening to see that the three main political parties have incorporated various dimensions of population welfare and population management in their manifestos of 2024, and there is a Parliamentary Forum on Population, there is still a need to improve parliamentary oversight.
The federal and provincial commissions on the status of women, and the women’s ombudsman’s office, should be made an active part of such parliamentary forums, and a whole-of-government approach with active participation of civil society organisations must be developed. Last but not least, the Pakistan Health and Demographic Survey must be made a mandatory exercise to provide the required evidence base for population policy and governance.

Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, denies the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. His lawyers said in a letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal.
“My lawyers sent a request for pardon to the president of the country today. I expect that anyone who wishes for the good of the country [will] support this step,” Netanyahu said in a brief video statement released by his political party, the Likud.
Neither the prime minister, who has been on trial for five years, nor his lawyers made any admission of guilt.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life.







Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that the president can intervene when public interest is at stake, as in this case, with a view to healing divisions and strengthening national unity.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office described the request as “extraordinary” with “significant implications”. The president “will responsibly and sincerely consider the request” after receiving relevant opinions, his office said.
US President Donald Trump wrote to Herzog this month, urging him to consider granting the prime minister a pardon, saying the case against him was “a political, unjustified prosecution”.
Herzog’s office said the request would be forwarded to the pardons department in the justice ministry, as is standard practice, to collect opinions, which would be submitted to the president’s legal adviser, who will formulate a recommendation for the president.
Israel’s Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a close ally of the prime minister.
In the letter, Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that criminal proceedings against him had deepened societal divisions and that ending the trial was necessary for national reconciliation. They also wrote that increasingly frequent court hearings were burdensome while the prime minister was attempting to govern.
“I am required to testify three times a week … that is an impossible demand that is not made of any other citizen,” Netanyahu said in the video statement, emphasising that he had received the public’s trust by repeatedly winning elections.







Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three separate but related cases that centre around accusations that he granted favours to prominent business figures in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage.
The prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Coalition allies issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Opposition politician Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon.
Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election.
The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government.
Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges.
He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation.
Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/3021125240be88b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958339/imf-graft-report-not-criticism-but-catalyst-for-accelerating-long-overdue-reforms-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>IMF graft report not criticism but catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Sunday that the recent report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that highlighted financial irregularities in Pakistan was “not criticism” but a “catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms”.
The document’s publication, a precondition for the IMF’s approval for disbursing the next $1.2 billion loan tranche in December, found that institutional weaknesses, lack of transparency in state functions, preferential treatment for select businesses, and inefficiencies in public-sector transactions were major constraints to growth. It also called for a series of reforms spread across the next three to six months to help raise the growth rate to 5-6.5 per cent over the next five years.
The report led to criticism of the government, and opposition parties have called for a probe into the “worst financial scandal of Pakistan’s history”.
However, Aurangzeb said during a press conference in Islamabad today that the government itself had requested and facilitated the assessment to strengthen institutional reforms.
He maintained that the report acknowledged significant progress in sectors including taxation and governance, and that many of its priority recommendations were “already work in progress”.
The finance minister further said the government was committed to implementing the remaining recommendations as part of broader institutional reforms essential to sustaining Pakistan’s economic turnaround.
He said Pakistan’s structural challenges had built up over decades, and institutional reform was essential for sustaining economic stability.
The finance minister described the report “not as criticism, but as a catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms”.



Exports rise by 5pc
During the press conference, Aurangzeb outlined the government’s shift towards an “inclusive, private-sector-driven and export-led growth strategy”.
The finance minister highlighted the recent abolition of the Export Development Surcharge (EDS), a levy in place since 1991, as a “key demonstration of the government’s commitment to boosting export competitiveness”.
Aurangzeb noted that this, coupled with reforms to strengthen the governance of the Export Development Fund (EDF), “reflects a strong policy direction centred on empowering exporters, removing outdated distortions, and enabling the private sector to drive economic expansion”.







He said the decision had already been summarised for cabinet approval, after which its implementation would formally begin.
Aurangzeb highlighted that export performance had strengthened, with overall exports rising five per cent and IT services exports growing by over 20 per cent year-on-year.
“It is very important that we take this forward in a sustainable manner,” he said. “Exports are helping us.”
He stressed that the IT sector had recorded back-to-back monthly highs in September and October, establishing itself as a critical pillar of the “new economy,” alongside emerging sectors such as minerals and mining.
Aurangzeb noted that the $3.5bn Reko Diq-related syndication, now financially closed following the resolution of procedural delays, represented a transformational investment that would generate an estimated $2.8–$2.9bn in annual exports once production commenced.
He added that meanwhile, remittances remained a key strength of the economy.
“[Remittances] are moving from strength to strength. Last year, they were $38m, which was a big uptick from the year before that,” he said. “God willing, at a minimum, this year we will cross $41m, which will provide a sizeable buffer to the current account.”
He added that the government was managing imports carefully under a reformed tariff regime designed to support industrial competitiveness by prioritising raw materials and intermediate goods while “gradually phasing out long-standing protectionism”.
This transition, he emphasised, would be phased over four to five years to enable domestic industries to become internationally competitive.
He stressed that structural reforms remained central to the government’s agenda. The new tax policy office, now operational under the Finance Division, had conducted its first advisory board meeting and would henceforth be responsible for preparing tax policy and the national budget, he said.
The objective, he continued, was to bring consistency, analytical rigour, and private-sector input into the policy-making process while allowing the Federal Board of Revenue to focus on enforcement, compliance and technology-driven administration.
The finance minister further said that work on pension, debt, state-owned enterprises reform, the digital economy, taxation, energy, and rightsizing was proceeding as committed earlier.
On public finance, he said Pakistan’s domestic debt stock had stabilised for the first time in nine years, and debt servicing costs had begun to decline with the reduction in the policy rate.
He confirmed that Pakistan’s inaugural Panda Bond, supported by credit enhancement from the Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and approved by China’s central bank, would be “issued before December or, at the latest, before the Chinese New Year, helping diversify Pakistan’s funding base and reduce borrowing costs”.
NFC Award
The minister further said that the 11th National Finance Commission Award process would begin next week, with chief ministers and provincial finance teams joining deliberations.
Aurangzeb emphasised that revenue, expenditure and governance reforms required “constructive federal–provincial engagement” and expressed confidence that the meeting would be held in a spirit of “Pakistan first,” following the consensus approach demonstrated during the National Fiscal Pact.
The minister also addressed questions on taxation, energy costs, and competitiveness, acknowledging the concerns of the formal sector regarding high taxation and tariffs.
He said the government was committed to expanding the tax base, enhancing enforcement, reducing leakages, and ensuring fairness between formal and informal sectors.
The minister said that tax refunds had risen from Rs 200bn to Rs250bn over the five-month comparison period, reflecting responsiveness to industry needs. He highlighted the ongoing work in reducing circular debt and improving energy pricing, explaining that tangible progress had already been achieved on the financing and energy fronts.
Responding to questions about the sugar sector and commodity governance, the minister stated that durable reform required a full transition away from government involvement—from import and processing to trading and regulation. He emphasised that persistent distortions could not be eliminated without structural changes and that the government remained “committed to deregulation and transparency”.
Aurangzeb also drew attention to the “strong interest” of international firms in Pakistan across sectors, including energy, mining, IT, telecom, construction, logistics and EV manufacturing. He cited recent commitments from global companies such as Aramco, Wafi, Gunvor, Turkish Petroleum, Barrick Gold, Citizen Metals, Nova Minerals, BYD, Chery, NWTN Motors, Abu Dhabi Ports and Google.
He said that Pakistan had “turned a corner from the crisis of two years ago and is now pursuing a stable, export-driven, investment-focused growth model grounded in structural and institutional reforms”.
Moreover, he stressed that agriculture, large-scale manufacturing, the new economy, remittances and private investment would collectively contribute to a “more resilient and inclusive economic future” for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-11-30 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/302125550bf8e3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958336/imposition-of-governors-rule-in-kp-being-seriously-considered-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imposition of governor’s rule in KP being ‘seriously considered’: state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Sunday that the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
Malik said this on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ where he was asked about the possibility of this move and the government’s plans in this regard.
He said KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team had “badly failed in having any sort of a workable situation”. Neither do they want to have any kind of coordination or cohesion with the Centre, nor do they take any action in areas where it was needed, he added.
Given the situation, the governor’s rule was now being “seriously considered”, he said, adding that it was a “constitutional measure”, which was undertaken in case of an “absolute necessity”.
“And I think, the situation in KP itself calls for a step to be taken in this regard so that the presence of an administrative structure is ensured there.”
Asked whether the government had finalised the decision to impose the governor’s rule in KP, Malik said the president had the authority on this based on the prime minister’s advice under Articles 232 and 234 of the Constitution. “And the federal government is pondering [this option].”
However, when it was pointed out that under Article 234 a governor could recommend the move to the president while the federal government had little to do with it, the state minister said the governor’s recommendation was just one option.
“The president can take this step on his own as well […] the approval for which will later have to be taken by a joint sitting of [Parliament],” he said, adding that under the Constitution, governor’s rule could be imposed initially for two months, and it could later be extended further if required.
When asked whether the governor’s rule would be imposed after replacing incumbent KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Malik replied that the matter was at a “very nascent” stage.
Citing “reports”, he also accused the KP government of “planning to block routes and cut off the province” from the rest of the country.
Kundi unaware of reports about potential removal
Earlier today, KP Governor Kundi expressed ignorance about reports of him potentially being replaced and said he would “accept” his party’s decision in case of such a scenario.
The KP governor made this statement while speaking to journalists, who sought his comments on his potential replacement.
When one of them said that “total six names” had surfaced in connection with the matter, Kundi asked: “Where have they surfaced?”
To that, the journalist said they were being reported in the media.
“Now if the media will appoint the governor, then may God have mercy on us,” replied Kundi.
To a question about a possible scenario of his removal, the governor said he would “accept whatever the party’s decision will be”.
Media reports about Kundi’s potential removal have been circulating lately, which the KP governor had previously denied. Back then, too, he said he would “accept whatever decision will be taken by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
Amid these reports, Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week to discuss matters concerning KP, including the imposition of governor’s rule.
At the time, a source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Kundi and gave signals that the government had no intention of removing him.
The discussion on the occasion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation, during which Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal were also present.
Among them, the issue of imposing governor’s rule in KP was discussed reportedly due to a rigid stance by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister on the occasion to provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.</p><small>2025-11-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/301712508f41b02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958328/chief-of-defence-forces-notification-to-be-issued-in-due-course-of-time-process-has-been-initiated-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Chief of Defence Forces notification to be issued in due course of time, process has been initiated: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Sunday said that the notification regarding the Chief of Defence Forces’ (CDF) appointment would be issued “in due course of time”, the process for which had started.
“Please be informed that the process has been initiated. PM is returning shortly. Notification will be issued in due course of time,” Asif said in a post on social media platform X.







The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on Nov 27. It will be a dual-hatted position combined with the office of the army chief.

 

Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but November 29 was seen as a critical marker, being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Field Marshal Asim Munir, was set to expire.
Asif’s statement came as the November 29 date passed without any notification being issued to formally appoint the country’s first CDF.
His statement implies that the notification will be issued upon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s return to the country, who is currently visiting London. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Dawn that the PM would return to Pakistan on Monday.
Need for notification
Some legal experts had argued that without a new notification, Field Marshal Munir’s tenure could be interpreted as having lapsed.
However, a 2024 amendment to the Pakistan Army Act extended the tenure of the service chiefs to five years. That change included a “deeming” clause stating that the amendment “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act”, a formulation that legal minds say removed the requirement for a fresh notification extending the COAS tenure from three to five years.
Still, there is near consensus among security and legal officials that the creation of the CDF post, a new assignment rather than a continuation, does require a formal notification. Under the 27th Ame­ndment and subsequent changes to the Army Act, the army chief will simultaneously serve as the CDF for a five-year term.
Therefore, several security sources, when contacted by Dawn earlier, said the government would have to issue a new, public notification assigning the CDF role to Field Marshal Munir.
Unresolved debates
The delay in the issuance of the notification has also been widely seen as a sign of unresolved debates within the highest levels of government. According to individuals with insight into the discussions, one point that has been under consideration is which date will be taken as the start of the COAS’s five-year tenure: November 2022 when Field Marshal Munir originally took command or November 2025 as had been broadly speculated after passage of the new legislation.
Another sensitive question that has been raised pertains to the extent of operational and command authority the CDF would exercise over the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament earlier this month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defence framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision has been the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.

The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”.







Egyptian FM meets Zardari
Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today.
A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”.
He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.







According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”.
He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said.
For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added.
The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity.
The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.
Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses
Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference.
Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million.
“With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced.
“These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted.



The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation.
The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”.
The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses.
Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500.
He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”.
The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt.
“Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers.
Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration.
Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations.
Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary.
“They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained.
“Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said.
“We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries.
Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”.
“Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.”
“Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed.
The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora.
Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt.

 

The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University.
“While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings.
The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.”
Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism
At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar.
“We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed.
“The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.”

 

The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism.
“Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added.
Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”.
‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’
The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”.
“This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh.

 

“Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“
The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”.
“It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”.
Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza.
“I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said.
Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern.
Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM
Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”.
“I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels.
“That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said.
“We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added.

Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.”
He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC.
“So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.”
“Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted.
“I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added.

“Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”.
Earlier today, Dar received FM Abdelatty upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Office said on social media platform X.

Bilawal made the remarks in a video address to mark the PPP’s 58th foundation day, with his speech being live-streamed in “more than 100 districts” across the country, as per the party.
Bilawal recalled that the ruling PML-N had also proposed constitutional tweaks related to the provinces’ financial rights under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, which were then rejected by the PPP and did not make it to the final version of the 27th Amendment.
“The PPP considers that there were a lot of faultlines in this country and remain,” Bilawal said, adding that the PPP had tried to address those by giving provinces their rights and due representation, and restoring democracy in the past.
“Those people who are trying to play with the NFC Award or the 18th Amendment or other such matters, or are thinking of doing so, it is as if they are playing with fire,” Bilawal warned.







Noting that the government “could see” that the Indian defence minister made aggressive statements about Sindh and that tensions were being created on the Afghan border, Bilawal affirmed: “We will try our best that the internal faultlines in Pakistan are addressed, instead of providing any forces the chance to misuse or take advantage of our faultlines.”
The PPP chairman said that if united, the country had the ability to face any adversary, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and “all sorts of conspiracies”.
Bilawal praised his party for “saving the constitutional guarantee of the provinces’ financial share”.

 

“They (PML-N) wanted to bring back the system of executive magistry; they wanted back the subjects of education and population control that had been devolved to provinces in the 18th Amendment. […] Similarly, the government had other wishes,” he noted.
“I have been protecting your rights and God-willing, will keep doing so,” the PPP scion vowed, adding that his party was ready to support any decision that would strengthen the federation.
“But the PPP can never back a decision that would weaken the federation or through which province’s rights would be usurped,” he asserted.
‘FCC will prove wrong those trying to make it controversial’
During his address, Bilawal also spoke about the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) established under the 27th Amendment — a move the PPP had long advocated for, but was omitted in the 26th Amendment.
“Some people are trying to make this constitutional court controversial,” he noted, adding that he hoped the FCC would “prove all those wrong through its character”.







In a message to those “political forces who wanted to make a parliamentary move controversial”, the PPP chief stressed that it was the parliament’s and the public representatives’ power to enact legislation.
“If someone is demanding that a court or a judge decide on whether the Amendment can remain or not, it is not their authority, and neither will we allow that any other institution interferes in the parliament,” Bilawal warned.
The 27th Amendment and the FCC created through it have been at the centre of a heated debate. The FCC has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s top judicial forum, with international experts and judges having raised concerns over judicial independence.

 

“[The FCC], that institution and its judges have a major responsibility on their shoulders. While representing the Centre, they have to oversee our constitutional issues and judicial independence,” Bilawal said.
He expressed the hope that the FCC would try to “restore people’s trust [in the judiciary] and become a court that will prioritise the Constitution, the law and do justice”.
The PPP scion said it was “definitely his wish” that a Constitutional Amendment be passed through a consensus. However, he highlighted: “If not with consensus, then this work was done through a majority and by the parliament, so only the parliament has the power to review that decision or not.”
“We hope that the constitutional court will look at this country’s biggest constitutional and political issues, and our older Supreme Court of Pakistan will look at all criminal matters,” Bilawal said.
Taking a jibe at what his party deemed judicial activism, Bilawal said he hoped the FCC would not be a court that would “head out to build dams, destroy poor people’s homes, decide the prices of tomato and samosas, send democratic governments home, or disqualify prime ministers for not writing a letter”.

 

“We are about to address a major judicial faultline in the form of the constitutional court,” Bilawal asserted.
He added that this new set-up would enable the ordinary citizens to get “immediate relief” in criminal cases, as they will be focused on by the SC.
“We not only fulfilled the [promise] of creating a constitutional court but also assured the equal representation of provinces in that court,” he highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-30 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/3017231220ebdc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958334/shadab-khans-return-for-t20-world-cup-still-a-possibility-says-captain-salman-ali-agha' target='_blank'><strong>Shadab Khan’s return for T20 World Cup still a possibility, says captain Salman Ali Agha</strong></a><br><p>Doors are not yet closed on all-rounder Shadab Khan to make a comeback in the Pakistan side ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup, skipper Salman Ali Agha said on Saturday.
Shadab last featured for the national side back in June during the T20I series against Bangladesh before an injury ruled him out.
Since then, Pakistan have found their main all-rounder in Mohammad Nawaz, who has starred with both bat and ball across past six months as the team won a tri-series in the UAE before making it to the Asia Cup final.
On Saturday, Pakistan won another tri-series, this time at home, after beating Sri Lanka clinically in Rawalpindi — the match seeing Nawaz take three wickets to turn the game around for the hosts.
Apart from Nawaz, opener Saim Ayub has also consolidated his role as Pakistan’s impactful spin option while Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq have announced themselves as worthy specialists.
Salman, however, didn’t rule out the possibility of Shadab’s return when the teams flies out to Sri Lanka — the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup along with India — in the first week of February.
“He was the team’s vice-captain when he got injured unfortunately,” Salman said of Shadab in the post-match press conference.
“And when you have a player available who has played so many World Cups, who has experience, who can bat at number 5-6 and give you a spin option—if we feel he fits, then of course, why not?”
The growing depth in Pakistan’s spin department has been one of the defining themes of their white-ball resurgence in recent months.
With Saim providing regular breakthroughs in the powerplay, and the pairing of Abrar and Usman offering variety through the middle overs, Salman said the management was now confident of tailoring combinations according to conditions in Sri Lanka, where spin is expected to dominate.
“If conditions allow us to play two specialist spinners, or even more, we won’t hesitate,” he said.
“We have Nawaz, Saim, Abrar and Usman — four very different options. Our job is simply to field whatever combination is best for Pakistan. If the pitches support spinners, you may see all of them.”
Pakistan’s opponents at the World Cup will likely face surfaces that demand nuance rather than brute force, a factor that Salman believes could neutralise the trend of high-scoring T20Is elsewhere.
Asked whether Pakistan possess the batting strength to chase scores beyond 200 — a benchmark that has increasingly become common in the format — he was measured.
“For that, conditions have to allow 200 runs to be scored,” he said. “In Sri Lanka, you generally don’t get pitches where such totals are common.
“But if the surface demands it, we have the capability to both score and chase big totals. The players have shown that over the past few months.”
The captain also reflected on Pakistan’s overall progress this year, noting that the side had grown significantly since their disappointing start in January.
He pointed out that despite early setbacks, the team had stitched together a consistent run across white-ball cricket in the build-up to the World Cup cycle.
“Our start wasn’t good,” he admitted. “But we finished the year strongly. In the last two or three months, we have won almost all our white-ball series.
“Now the challenge is to carry this momentum into next year. We have no matches in December, so the next phase begins immediately in January. We want 2026 to be a year people remember — by winning the World Cup.”
With Pakistan currently employing different captains across formats, Salman acknowledged the added responsibility on his shoulders but insisted he had grown into the role after an initial period of adjustment.
“If you’re leading Pakistan, there will always be pressure,” he said. “Responsibility comes with the job. Maybe at the start I struggled to balance my batting with captaincy, but over the last five or six months I have understood how to manage both. I feel far more settled now.”</p><small>2025-11-30 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/30134422d4e1ff0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958322/defence-minister-says-muslim-countries-may-need-to-reassess-stance-on-gaza-peace-treaty-due-to-israeli-ceasefire-violations' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister says Muslim countries may need to reassess stance on Gaza peace treaty due to Israeli ceasefire violations</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday expressed concerns about Israel’s commitment to peace in Gaza, saying that Muslim countries that had supported the peace treaty may need to “reassess their stance” in the face of continued violations of the fragile ceasefire in the region.
Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israel has continued to bombard the territory while a long-term plan for peace is discussed.
The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”.
“The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said.
The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence.
“Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said.
Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict.
He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”.







A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations.
Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas.
“We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-30 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/30143643614bbb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958323/ecp-terms-allegations-of-rigging-in-november-by-elections-as-baseless' target='_blank'><strong>ECP terms allegations of rigging in November by-elections as ‘baseless’</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Sunday termed the allegations of rigging in November 23 by-elections, particularly in NA-18 Haripur, as “baseless”.
By-elections were held for six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats earlier this month. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them. However, opposition party PTI alleged rigging with leader Asad Qaiser rejecting the results.
“As usual, certain specific elements are levelling baseless allegations to make the recent by-elections (particularly NA-18 Haripur) controversial. These allegations include portraying the appointment of the district returning officer (DRO) and returning officer (RO) in NA-18 Haripur as a conspiracy,” the election regulator said in a statement.
Terming such claims “entirely contrary to the facts”, the ECP explained that due to a shortage of staff during general elections, it was not possible for the Commission to appoint ROs and DROs itself. However, in by-elections, such appointments were made as needed.
“In this by-election as well, officers of the Commission already posted in the same area were appointed as DRO and RO,” said the ECP.
“Under the Elections Act, 2017, this is the Commission’s fully legal authority, and the Election Commission has always appointed DROs and ROs using this authority,” it added.
The appointments of DROs and ROs are made well before polling day, and no objection was raised from any side until the day of the election, according to the ECP. “These allegations are being made only after losing the election.”
Furthermore, the ECP said that various forums existed for resolving disputes once the election was completed. “If the RO had refused to receive any application, the concerned party should have approached the Election Commission, but this was not done.”
Similarly, the statement added, “for stopping consolidation or requesting recounting after the election, the first forum is the RO, and if the RO does not act, the Commission should be approached within the prescribed time, but this was also not done”.
The Commission detailed that the allegation of Form-45 being prepared in advance is also incorrect, because “all presiding officers and support staff were taken from the provincial administration”.
“Had the Election Commission desired, it could have appointed employees of federal institutions posted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as presiding officers,” ECP said. “The staff provided by the provincial administration submitted the polling bags and results to the RO’s office after the election, and the security personnel were also from the provincial government.”
The purpose of repeating the same baseless accusations after every election, ECP claimed in its statement, “is only to cast doubt on the electoral process”.
“If any party has objections to the results, the proper forum is the Election Tribunal (which is already functional) where an election petition may be filed, instead of making allegations in the media,” ECP stated, adding that the Commission, including in these by-elections, “has taken actions strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law and will continue to do so”.</p><small>2025-11-30 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/30123733903bb6b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958319/dinosaur-tartare-and-holograms-dubai-ai-chef-sparks-awe-and-ire' target='_blank'><strong>‘Dinosaur tartare’ and holograms: Dubai AI chef sparks awe and ire</strong></a><br><p>A Dubai restaurant has opened that prides itself on having the world’s “first AI chef”, the latest ostentatious dive into new technology in a city obsessed with being on the cutting edge of the future.
The Emirati city has become increasingly known for its growing culinary scene, with thousands of restaurants on offer from luxurious Michelin-starred eateries to greasy spoons serving up bona fide street food from across the Middle East and Asia.
But at Woohoo, the brains behind the menu is not a person but an AI programme — known as chef Aiman — trained on thousands of recipes and decades of culinary research and molecular gastronomy.
Chef Aiman can also optimise menus and balance flavours, according to the establishment.
The real work of preparing and serving the food, however, remains in human hands, for now.
“AI is going to create better dishes than humans maybe in the future,” said the restaurant’s Turkish co-founder Ahmet Oytun Cakir.
While Woohoo’s menu mostly comprises international fusion dishes, some AI creations stand out.
This includes a “dinosaur tartare” meant to recreate the taste of extinct reptiles.
The restaurant did not reveal the dinosaur tartare recipe, which was created using DNA mapping.
Priced at roughly 50 euros ($58), the dish tastes like a combination of raw meats and is served on a pulsating plate to appear as if it were breathing.
“It was a total surprise. It was so delicious,” said customer Efe Urgunlu.
Along with AI-generated holograms and sci-fi animation, the heart of the neon-lit venue features a giant cylindrical computer — presented as the digital mainframe powering the restaurant’s lights and smoke shows.

‘I don’t believe in it’
Woohoo’s Turkish chef Serhat Karanfil oversees the cooking and the final presentation and admits that he does not always agree with the AI chef’s choices and selections.
“If I taste it, for example, and it is too spicy, I talk to chef Aiman again. After we discuss, we find the right balance,” he said.
Cakir has high hopes that chef Aiman will one day become “the next Gordon Ramsay — but AI”.
Not everyone in Dubai’s vibrant food scene is convinced.
For Michelin-starred chef Mohamad Orfali, “there is no such thing as an AI chef”.
“I don’t believe in it,” the Syrian Dubai-based chef told AFP.
His Orfali Bros restaurant snatched a Michelin star last year, after Dubai became the first Middle Eastern city to join the prestigious guide in 2022.
Cooking requires “nafas”, or soul, Orfali explained, using the Arabic term that describes a cook’s personal flair for food and their ability to conjure up exceptional meals.
“Artificial intelligence lacks feelings and memories; in short, it has no nafas… It can’t imbue it into food.”

Dubai ideas
Orfali said he limited the use of AI in his own establishment to administrative tasks like setting the kitchen schedule and providing additional research.
“We use it as a kitchen assistant, but ultimately, it won’t cook,” he said.
Nonetheless, Woohoo has resonated with customers accustomed to the lavish offerings of Dubai, a tech-forward megalopolis with a proclivity for extravagance where AI has its own minister.
“Everyone is supporting these ideas here in Dubai,” said Cakir.
The restaurant has also created a social media buzz, with an Instagram account dedicated to the AI Chef that features chef Aiman’s avatar in videos sharing tips and recipes.
Dio, a customer who didn’t give her last name, said she visited the restaurant after seeing the craze around it.
“It is such a creative concept, so I thought I must experience it myself,” she said.
“The dishes were extraordinary.”

The shooting took place inside a banquet hall in Stockton, northeast of San Francisco, just before 6pm (7am Sunday PKT), San Joaquin County Sheriff’s office spokesperson Heather Brent told reporters in a news briefing.
The victims, who range from “juveniles to adults”, were taken to local hospitals, Brent said, adding that information on the shooting was limited.
“What we have confirmed at this time is that there was a banquet hall where a family was celebrating. We have 14 victims of this shooting. Four of those are deceased,” Brent said.
“Early indications suggest that this may be a targeted incident. Investigators are exploring all possibilities at this time.”
The sheriff’s office said in a post on social media that detectives were “working to determine the circumstances leading up to this tragedy”.
“We are urging anyone with information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of this incident to contact the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office immediately,” it said.
No suspect has been identified so far.
California Governor Gavin Newsom had been briefed on the shooting, his office said in a post on social media.







There have been 504 mass shootings in the US so far this year — including the Stockton incident — according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot.</p><small>2025-11-30 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/301209109494eda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958318/floods-hit-sri-lankas-capital-colombo-as-cyclone-ditwah-death-toll-rises-to-159' target='_blank'><strong>Floods hit Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo as Cyclone Ditwah death toll rises to 159</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lankan authorities battled rising floodwaters in parts of the capital on Sunday after a powerful cyclone left a trail of destruction, killing at least 159 people across the country.
The northern part of Colombo was facing a major flood, as the water level in the Kelani River continued to rise, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said.
The death toll had reached 159, with another 203 people missing, the DMC reported, following a week of heavy rains brought on by Cyclone Ditwah, which moved away from Sri Lanka on Saturday.
“Although the cyclone has left us, heavy rains upstream are now flooding low-lying areas along the banks of the Kelani River,” a DMC official said.



President Anura Kumara Dissanayake declared a state of emergency yesterday to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone and appealed for international aid.
India was the first to respond, sending relief supplies and two helicopters with crew to carry out rescue missions.
Japan said it will send a team to assess immediate needs and pledged further assistance.
While the rains have subsided across the island, several roads in the worst-affected central province remained inaccessible, the DMC said.
The extreme weather system has destroyed more than 20,000 homes and sent 122,000 people into state-run temporary shelters.
Another 833,000 people required assistance after being displaced by the floods.



Troops from the army, navy, and air force have been deployed alongside civilian workers and volunteers to assist with the relief effort.
Officials reported that about a third of the country remains without electricity or running water due to collapsed power lines and inundated water purification facilities. Internet connections have also been disrupted.
Pakistan extends relief assistance
On the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in coordination with the armed forces, launched a “comprehensive” relief assistance operation for Sri Lanka.
“A 45-member Army Urban Search & Rescue team, mobile field hospitals along with boats, life jackets, tents, blankets, infant milk, food packs and medicines will be dispatched via C-130 [tomorrow] from Noor Khan Airbase to Colombo,” the NDMA said on X shortly after 12am.
“Pakistan will continue to provide support to flood-hit Sri Lanka,” the NDMA affirmed.







Yesterday, the Pakistan Navy also delivered humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Sri Lankan authorities at the Colombo port.
Aid included “food staples, MREs (meals ready to eat), dry rations, first‑aid kits and medicines, along with equipment”, the Navy said.
“This swift support underscores Pakistan Navy’s commitment to international obligations, regional stability and solidarity with friendly nations in their hour of need,” it noted.







Expressing his heartfelt condolences, PM Shehbaz had said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”.
Cyclone Ditwah has become Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when flooding and landslides claimed more than 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands.
The worst flooding since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.</p><small>2025-11-30 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/30110433d07fac8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958251/dawnmedia-hosts-pakistan-population-summit-2025-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>DawnMedia hosts ‘Pakistan Population Summit 2025’ tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Population Summit 2025, a dialogue on the country’s high population rate, will be held in Islamabad from Dec 1 to 2.
Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) shows the average annual growth rate in Pakistan — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent, resulting in a population of 241.5 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world.
The country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050.
According to a DawnMedia press release, the two-day event will take place at the Serena Hotel.
The event will take stock of the situation in Pakistan, as it faces the challenges of rising population growth outpacing available resources.

 

“Urgent and serious action is required to bridge the growing gap between demographic increase and sustainable resource management. Recognising the crucial implications of a high population growth rate on Pakistan’s economy, social infrastructure, education, health, food and water security, and employment is critical,” it said.
The summit is aimed at bringing together politicians, economists, development specialists, and private-sector leaders to establish a practical pathway to long-term growth.
Notable speakers exp­ected to address the event include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb, among others.
The summit is being organised by DawnMedia in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, De­­v­­elopment and Special Ini­tiatives; the Ministry of Na­­tional Health Services, Regulations and Coordi­nation; the Sindh government, the KP government, UK International Deve­lopment and the World Bank Group as principal partners.
It is supported by the Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation, while the Population Council and FCDO serve as strategic partners, while Pathfinder International, Population Services International, QZ Catalyst, and UNFPA contribute as knowledge partners. Ipsos and Repu Media-Acumen Media Intel­ligence also support the initiative as research partners.

Jhang Satellite Town police said the attackers managed to flee after the shooting.
Munir Sadhana was on the way to Jhang District Courts Complex when his car was attacked near Bilqees Hospital. As a result of firing, his driver Mumtaz Ahmad died instantly while Sadhana himself, shopkeeper and passer-by Mushtaq were shifted to Jhang District Headquarters Hospital where Sadhana and passer-by also succumbed to their injuries.
The lawyer was a close aide of former federal interior minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, who was present at the hospital to receive the body of his friend along with relatives of the deceased.
Deputy Commissioner Ali Akbar Bhinder and DPO Bilal Kiani were also present. As soon as news of attack reached the courts, the lawyers started their strike.
In a press release, DBA President Mehr Muhammad Fareed Nawaz Naul has announced three working days of mourning over the assassination of Sadhana. He demanded the immediate arrest of the killers.
Till the filing of this report, no FIR was registered and the police said they had not received a complaint for registration of the case yet.
A large number of people, including lawyers, judges and government officers, attended the funeral prayers for Sadhana at Church Ground.
ACCIDENT: A motorcycle rider died and his two pillions were injured critically after a speeding car hit their two-wheeler near the FDA City gate on the Sargodha Road.
Nishatabad police identified the deceased as Ahmad Ali (19) of Chak 46-JB and injured as Naveed (18) and Nawaz (21). Both the injured were shifted to Allied Hospital. The car driver fled after the accident.
Meanwhile, a 22-year-old unidentified man died at Allied Hospital after being hit by a train near the graveyard of Chak Bhaiwala in Millat Town police area. He was crossing the track when he was hit by the train.
APPROVAL: The Provincial Development Working Party (PWDP) has approved the establishment of a landfill site for waste management in Faisalabad.
The landfill site, which will be established on 150 acres, at the locality of Lakwana located on the Makkuana-Khurianwala Road will have a capacity to dump 1,100 tonnes of waste every day while a plan for recycling waste/garbage is also included in it.
Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar said there was a dire need for a landfill site in Faisalabad and the approval of funds for it by the PWDP was a significant step. He said the work on this project would start soon.

The terrified local community nicknamed the animal ‘Osama bin Laden’, after the then-leader of the global terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda.
The Indian government eventually issued shoot-to-kill orders, and a professional hunter was contracted for the task. Aided by the people of the small Assamese town of Behali, the hunter successfully cornered the destructive elephant and shot it dead.
While most of the affected population celebrated the elephant’s demise, a significant number of sceptics arose. They argued that an innocent animal had been slain and that ‘Osama’ remained alive and active. This belief persisted even though the elephant was never seen again. The doubters continued to present ‘evidence’ suggesting it was alive and had likely gone into hiding.
In 2011, when the terrorist Osama bin Laden was shot dead by American Navy Seals, sceptics flooded social media sites to claim that a ‘body double’ of the terrorist had been killed and the real Osama was still alive. They argued that the decision by the Americans not to release graphic photos and DNA evidence was a reason for doubt. The US government stated the decision was made to avoid inciting further violence and to prevent the creation of a shrine, and that DNA evidence from family members confirmed the identity beyond a doubt.

While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not an exercise in critical thinking

Despite the abundance of evidence confirming that he was shot and his body disposed of in the open sea, and that he was never seen or heard from again, a small but persistent group of sceptics remains unconvinced. In 2019, an acquaintance with a PhD in economics insisted that bin Laden’s killing was a hoax and that he was still alive. When I challenged the convoluted theories he offered to support his claims, he accused me of undermining ‘critical thinking.’

 

Critical thinking requires one to think clearly and rationally, basing conclusions on facts and evidence rather than emotion or personal opinion. The economist in question did the exact opposite. He presented his opinion as fact and relied on his emotional desire to see a violent “challenger” to “American imperialism” succeed as his sole “evidence”. More than evidence, this was wishful thinking.
For years, academics and scholars have been bemoaning the gradual decline in people’s ability to apply critical thinking. According to the American online learning specialist Holly Burns, and many like her, this loss is driven by several factors. Modern information consumption favours speed and superficiality over depth and reflection; our current social and political environment rewards fast, emotional responses and conformity; and many educational systems prioritise standardised testing and recall at the expense of developing complex reasoning skills.
Then there are growing incidents of formulating conspiracy theories and presenting them as outcomes of critical thinking. This is what my economist friend was doing. In an article for the British Psychology Society, the journalist and author Emily Reynolds posited that the confusion between conspiracy theories and critical thinking stems from their shared starting point: both involve scepticism and rejection of official narratives.
Both their starting point is a sceptical question. But their routes to investigate or answer the question quickly bifurcate. Critical thinking is about looking for the most convincing answer backed by solid evidence, even if the evidence produces an answer that is not to the liking of the questioner. A conspiracy theorist’s quest is more about ‘unmasking’ a perceived conspiracy and discarding any evidence that fails to back the claim of a diabolical plot.
Critical thinking does not reject official claims outright — rather, it rigorously tests these claims against evidence before reaching a conclusion. In contrast, conspiracy theorists immediately reject official narratives and declare them as lies used to conceal a ‘truth’, often without any convincing counter-evidence. Their subsequent effort is almost entirely focused on ‘proving’ this predetermined conclusion.



In the 2025 issue of the Journal of Intelligence, Professor Oscar Eugenio Tamayo Alzate wrote that critical thinking is “epistemic”. It involves thinking about the nature of knowledge and how we justify beliefs. It is a process of inquiry focused on acquiring true beliefs, evaluating claims and understanding the limits of what we know. It requires an understanding of how we construct, evaluate and use knowledge.
According to a 2017 essay in Current Directions in Psychological Science, whereas critical thinking’s motivation is epistemic, conspiracy theories have “existential motives.”
Studies have shown that people are likely to turn to conspiracy theories when they are anxious and feel powerless. Conspiracy belief is strongly related to lack of social or political control.
This dynamic is compounded by the now widely accepted consensus within the scientific community that individuals with low analytical and critical thinking skills often overestimate their own competence. And these are the people more likely to shape or believe in conspiracy theories. They genuinely believe that their ability to question the mainstream narrative is a sign of high intelligence and insight. This ‘delusion’ feels reassuring to a person confused or disturbed by certain events.
The individual actively looks for information that supports his belief in a conspiracy, refusing to accommodate and even suspect any evidence to the contrary. The sense of power in them comes from the belief that, apparently, they have decoded something secretive, hidden and only known to a few.

 

The final boundary lies in what is being questioned. Last year, a well-known TV journalist shared a meme-like image of a turkey crossing the road while carrying a kitchen knife. The journalist asked, “Is this real?” Apart from the image being clearly amateurish and having the AI tool watermark visible, questioning it was not an exercise in critical thinking. Nor did it warrant a deep dive.
While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not critical thinking. There is more than enough evidence that Osama the terrorist and Osama the elephant are both permanently gone, confirmed by both official evidence and robust critical assessment. Questioning these assessments is like questioning the obvious. Turkeys don’t walk around carrying knives.
Questioning this is not a sign of critical thinking, but sloppy pretence. And maybe, even delusions about oneself, which often lead to conspiratorial beliefs.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Con­stitutional Court (FCC), the country’s newly-established apex forum for constitutional interpretation, apparently acting under the proviso of Article 208 of the Constitution made certain appointments in which some employees have been placed in the federal government’s Special Professional Pay Scale (SPPS) policy.
A notification issued by FCC earlier this week, and approved by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, created eight senior posts — including one in BS-22 and seven in BS-21 — all placed in SPPS. Under SPPS-I, the pay package ranges from Rs1.5 million to Rs2m, almost equivalent to the salary of a high court judge.
However, senior federal officials familiar with service laws say the FCC administration has thus far not framed any rules under Article 208 and therefore, under the proviso to the said article, can only follow the Supreme Court Rules relating to the appointment of officers and servants of the SC.
Assigning the pay scales of SPPS to certain officers, without there being a similar provision in the related Supreme Court Rules, may raise issues as to the legality of the settled terms and conditions of officers and servants of FCC.
At present there are four types of pay packages for those being paid from the exchequer.
It includes the Basic Pay Scale, which applies to all the government sector; the Project Pay Scale, which covers the salaries of those working on specific projects of the government; the Management Pay Scale, also called the MP Scale for highly trained professionals; and SPPS, which was introduced to attract the highly paid experts of the private sector.
According to the FCC notification — issued under Article 208 of the Constitution — the court has created administrative posts, including: registrar (SPPS-I/BS-22) – one post, secretary to the chief justice (SPPS/BS-21) — one post, additional registrar (SPPS/BS-21) — six posts, deputy registrars (BS-20) — six posts, assistant registrars (BS-19) — 10 posts, senior private secretaries (BS-20) — five posts , research and reference officers (BS-19–20) — six posts, and a range of other positions from BS-16 to BS-2, including senior assistants, clerks, dri­­­vers, daftaris, qasids and sweepers.
The notification states that the expenditure will be met from FCC’s allocated budget for FY 2025-26.
‘Not permitted under SC Rules’
A senior court official told Dawn that the SPPS pay scales were incorporated into the notification without fully understanding the legal prerequisites, adding that a review was now under consideration.
The 27th Constitutional Amen­dment, which created FCC, amended Article 208 to clarify that till the court frames its own rules, the rules governing officers and servants of the Supreme Court shall apply mutatis mutandis.
The proviso read: “…till such time rules are made in this regard, the rules providing for the appointment of officers and servants of the Supreme Court and for their terms and conditions of employment shall mutatis mutandis apply to the officers and servants of the Federal Constitutional Court.”
A senior SC official confirmed that the court’s rules contained no provis­ion for SPPS appointments and did not permit high-salary contractual expert hiring structures of this nature.
The SPPS framework — detailed in the Establishment Division’s office memorandum of April 9, 2024 — lays out strict conditions for creating and filling the SPPS positions.
They include that the SPPS posts are for technical specialists, not regular bureaucracy. This means they require “highly skilled and specialised professional experts” in specific technical fields.
“It cannot be used to appoint registrars, secretaries, additional registrars or routine judicial administrators, who fall under regular service rules,” a senior official of the Establishment Division told Dawn.
Mandatory steps
As per the SPPS policy, before creating any posts, the sponsoring division must: establish that no equivalent expertise exists within sanctioned strength; prepare detailed terms of reference, job descriptions, job specifications, deliverables and timelines; and provide justification for hiring technical specialists under SPPS instead of management or regular service scales.
There is no indication that FCC conducted such a need assessment as it was not mentioned in the notification.
The SPPS recruitment must be competitive and widely advertised. The policy requires: national advertisement of vacancies; scrutiny by an internal committee; selection by a special selection board, which includes ministry officials and outside experts; and approval from the relevant minister or secretary depending on scale.
These steps are mandatory, but the FCC notification simply created the SPPS posts without initiating any recruitment process.
The SPPS appointments are contractual, not permanent, the policy read. It added that SPPS was strictly for two-year contracts, extendable only after performance evaluation. The FCC notification creates the posts as regular establishment positions, contradicting the SPPS structure.
FCC Registrar Mohammad Hafeezullah Khan told Dawn that the SPPS packages were “in accordance with the law”.
He argued that Article 208 empowered FCC to determine its own staffing structure.

“Due to the drop in the Karkheh Dam reservoir level, its power plant’s units were removed from the production circuit,” Amir Mahmoudi, the head of the dam and its power plant, said, according to state news agency IRNA.
He added that the water was subsequently released from the lower valves of the dam to meet the needs of people living downstream.
He said that the reservoir behind the dam is currently holding about one billion cubic metres of water, adding that “the current water level is 180 meters, which is 40 meters lower than the natural operating level” for electricity production.
The Karkheh Dam is one of the biggest earthen dams in the world and the largest in Iran and the Middle East, according to IRNA.
Built on the Karkheh River, it is located 22 kilometres (14 miles) northwest of the city of Andimeshk in the southwestern province of Khuzestan.
The development comes as the country faces one of its most severe droughts since records began six decades ago.
Iranian media have in past weeks reported that precipitation levels had de­creased by about 90 percent this year, compared with the long-term average.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X that the suspect, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay, had uploaded a TikTok video showing himself assembling what he suggested was an explosive device. She said the video indicated that the Fort Worth area was his intended target.







Alokozay was arrested on Tuesday by the Texas Department of Public Safety and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and charged with making terroristic threats.
The arrest came less than 24 hours before the violent attack in Washington in which another Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, shot and critically wounded two members of the US National Guard. Lakanwal, who had been in the United States for more than a year, opened fire during a routine patrol near a residential neighborhood not far from the Capitol. Authorities described the shooting as a deliberate act of terror. He was taken into custody shortly afterward.

Suspect uploaded video on social media showing himself assembling ‘explosive device’

The two back-to-back incidents involving Afghan nationals have added urgency to President Donald Trump’s new immigration actions. The president has already announced a “reverse migration” initiative aimed at removing immigrants who “do not belong here or do not add benefit to our country”. He has also ordered federal agencies to conduct heightened security reviews of Afghans who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome, calling for a case-by-case reassessment of their status.
Trump has vowed a permanent halt to migration from all third world countries and directed his administration to reexamine every refugee, parole, and humanitarian program created during the Biden years. More directives are expected as agencies expand their scrutiny of recent arrivals.

In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability.
A press release issued by the FO said that Pakistan rejected the “baseless” statement.
“Pakistan notes with deep concern the ungrounded and misplaced apprehensions aired on behalf of the UN high commissioner for human rights regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment adopted by the two-third majority of the parliament of Pakistan,” the press release by the FO said.
“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the Constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan,” it added.
The FO said that democracy and democratic methods “form the bedrock of civil and political rights, and therefore must be respected”.
“The constitutional amendments adopted by the parliament of Pakistan followed due procedures as enshrined in Pakistan’s Constitution,” it said.
It added that Pakistan remained “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law” as enshrined in the Constitution.
“While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan’s views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the FO said.
“We urge the high commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan’s parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation.”
The recent 27th Amendment was pushed through Parliament at top speed earlier this month amid widespread outcry. Among the top concerns are its overhaul of the judicial system via the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court, and changes to Article 243 positioning the army chief as the new Chief of Defence Forces at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.</p><small>2025-11-30 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/300918509d592d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958213/kmc-plans-five-new-graveyards-as-existing-cemeteries-run-out-of-space' target='_blank'><strong>KMC plans five new graveyards as existing cemeteries run out of space</strong></a><br><p>• Four 500-acre graveyards to be established on city outskirts and one 25-acre within Karachi• Sindh govt is likely to approve mayor’s proposal soon• While burial charges are just Rs9,300 in KMC-run cemeteries, actual charged amount can run up to Rs150,000
KARACHI: Amid a burial-place crisis that could leave Karachi with nowhere to bury its dead by the year 2040, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has decided to establish four 500-acre graveyards on city outskirts and a new 25-acre graveyard within the metropolis.
The Sindh government has in principle agreed to this proposal and is likely to approve it soon.
The KMC’s plan came to the fore after repeated warnings that almost all city graveyards have run out of space for burial.
The situation has not only set off alarm bells but also exposed a set of troubling facts that are fast turning into a new challenge for Karachiites.
The sources said Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab pushed for the plan which got the provincial authorities’ nod after which the KMC could acquire plots at different locations.
“In recent meetings and back-to-back discussions between the two sides [the KMC and the Sindh government] it was finally decided that four major locations measuring around 500 acres each would be marked for the KMC graveyards at different city outskirts. A 25-acre piece of land has also been sought within the city which is also expected to receive a go-ahead from the Sindh government. The land within the city is expected to be marked near the newly built Shahrah-e-Bhutto,” said an official.
A KMC official said that the city has nearly 220 graveyards, of which 192 are formally allotted. Among the allotted graveyards, 173 are for Muslims and 19 for non-Muslims which included 12 Christian cemeteries and five Hindu cremation grounds.
“Of these allotted sites, 46 are overseen by the KMC, 20 are run by the Defence Housing Authority, various cantonments and government bodies, while 112 — 99 Muslim and 13 non-Muslim — are managed by social organisations, community groups and private entities. An additional 14 graveyards are operated by various institutions or individuals,” he added.
He said that amid complaints that old graves were being demolished to make room for new burial spaces, the KMC had already imposed a ban on burials in several major graveyards of the city, including Society Graveyard near Tariq Road, Model Colony Graveyard, Paposh Nagar Graveyard, Korangi No. 6 Graveyard, Yaseenabad Graveyard and Azeempura Graveyard. However, he acknowledged that the ban was not being fully enforced on any of these graveyards in practice.
With least focus of the law-enforcement agencies and deteriorating situation at most graveyards, the burial grounds are also fast becoming safe havens for drug traffickers and criminals, he added.
Another official said that the growing control of “mafias” on the city graveyards was not only a problem for Karachiites, but also had led to encroachments and illegal plotting, commonly known as “China-cutting”.
“The reality is that there is no space in the city’s well-known and traditional graveyards and this is the fact which KMC officials and certain other elements are exploiting,” said the official.
“If a family wishes to bury its loved one in a specific graveyard, only grave-related expenses can reach Rs100,000 Rs150,000. Most people are not even aware that at KMC-run graveyards, the grave and burial fee is just Rs9,300. But due to fast shrinking space, this job has become a mafia’s business. If the plan prepared and proposed by the Karachi mayor meets the reality, it would be a great relief for the Karachiites.”

Justice Jahangiri is among the three IHC judges who removed their personal effects from the high court building over the past week as rumours intensified regarding their possible resignations following sweeping constitutional changes introduced through the 27th Amendment.
The three judges — Justices Jahangiri, Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan — had reportedly packed their belongings and shifted them home. According to the sources, Justice Jahangiri removed all books, documents, decorative items and other personal effects from his chamber, and even took back the furniture he had arranged himself.
The sources said informal directives to clear the chambers were relayed shortly after the 27th Amendment came into force. The amendment reshaped the judicial structure by creating the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and empowering authorities to transfer high court judges without their consent.

IHC bench to hear judge’s degree case on Dec 2

Justice Jahangiri is expected to make a final decision by Dec 1. His planned visit to the IHCBA on Dec 2 coincides with the hearing of a petition challenging the validity of his law degree — a matter now central to the controversy.
Insiders said his five-year term in judicial service will complete on Dec 30, and a resignation would take effect from Dec 31.
The petition questioning his LLB surfaced earlier this year when Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions filed by PTI candidates who contested the February 2024 general elections.
Justice Jahangiri was one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) last year alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry. Later, five of these judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the federal government’s decision to transfer three judges to the IHC earlier this year.
The transferred judges — Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif — had been moved from the Lahore, Sindh and Balochistan high courts.
Justice Dogar later took oath as IHC chief justice. A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge on June 19, after which the petitioners approached the newly formed FCC, which also rejected their plea.
Degree case hearing
Meanwhile, an IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan is scheduled to hear the degree case against Justice Jahangiri on Dec 2. Although the IHC website initially listed the hearing for Dec 1, the case was shifted to the next day in a revised cause list.
It is believed that once the bench takes up the matter and issues notices after admitting the petition for regular hearing, the case would proceed to its logical end, and a resignation at that stage would not halt proceedings without proper judicial scrutiny.
Recently, the SJC continued proceedings against former Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi despite his resignation, ultimately finding him guilty of misconduct and punishing him accordingly.
On Sept 16, the same bench barred Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial duties through an interim order. He then approached the Supreme Court in person.
On Sept 29, a five-member constitutional bench suspended the restraining order on the grounds that it had been issued without notice.
The next day, the bench set aside the order entirely, declaring it “null and void” and holding that a sitting judge could not be barred from judicial work through an interim directive.
The petition filed by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 seeks a writ of quo warranto against Justice Jahangiri, arguing that his LLB from Karachi University is “invalid” and that his legal career and elevation are therefore unconstitutional — a jurisdiction rarely exercised in such matters.
Justice Jahangiri has not joined the separate petition filed by four IHC judges challenging the 27th Amendment.

LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Spea­­ker Malik Ahmad Khan has defended the 27th Constitution Amendment, describing it as a “necessary institutional reform aimed at reducing friction among constitutional bodies, clarifying judicial jurisdiction, and ensuring long-term administrative stability”.
Addressing the “Speaker Aur Awam” public engagement session here on Saturday, he said a major part of the discussion centered on the 27th Amendment. He said the amendment established a Federal Constitutional Court, introduced reforms to the transfer process for high court judges, created a commander for the new National Strategic Command, and provided legal protections to senior armed forces officials and the president.
“The amendment was necessary institutional reform aimed at reducing friction among constitutional bodies, clarifying judicial jurisdiction, and ensuring long-term administrative stability,” he reiterated.
He emphasised that the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court would help streamline constitutional cases, reduce overlapping mandates between courts, and promote greater judicial efficiency. Stability in constitutional interpretation, he argued, was essential for governance, economic continuity, and strengthening the federal structure.
Mr Khan also explained the role of the Punjab Assembly in shaping the lives of citizens through legislation, oversight, and representation. He highlighted the importance of youth participation in democracy, noting that the assembly’s legitimacy grew when the public — especially young people — engaged directly with elected representatives.
Defamation suit
Meanwhile, Malik Ahmad Khan was cross-examined on Saturday by counsel for incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in a defamation suit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against the ex-PM.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing of the Rs10 billion defamation suit.
The Punjab Assembly speaker appeared before the court to record his statement. Before testifying, he took an oath, stating that he would only speak the truth and that Almighty Allah would be displeased with him if he lied.
Malik Ahmad told the court that he has political and party affiliation with PM Shehbaz. He said the PTI founding chairman had levelled allegations in April 2017, which were aired on various television channels. He said the allegations were baseless and misleading, adding that they were repeated in a private TV programme and during a rally at an Islamabad playground.
The speaker stated that the propaganda, accusations and false statements were aimed at damaging PM Shehbaz’s reputation.
Responding to queries from the defendant’s counsel, he said he has also practised law and filed cases in the past. In reply to another question, he said the allegations were made in Islamabad and Peshawar, not in Punjab. However, he said he had heard them on TV channels in Lahore.
The PTI founder’s counsel asked whether, under defamation law, the suit should have been filed in Islamabad. The speaker replied that it was the prerogative of the plaintiff’s lawyers to decide where the suit should be filed.
To another query, Malik Ahmad said that to his knowledge the Panama leaks included names of individuals with offshore investments.
He expressed ignorance when asked if Imran Khan or Nawaz Sharif had filed any petition in the Supreme Court regarding the Panama leaks.
He acknowledged that former PM Nawaz Sharif was convicted and disqualified.
The judge adjourned the hearing for recording testimonies of more witnesses on Dec 13.
Previously, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar had also been cross-examined in the defamation suit.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10 billion as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.

QUETTA: Seven blasts rocked Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali on Saturday, with one explosion blowing up a section of railway track near the provincial capital and suspending train traffic to other parts of the country.
The first blast took place near a police checkpost on Qambrani Road, where unidentified atta­ckers hurled a grenade. The device exploded but caused no loss of life.
Police said the second blast occurred shortly afterwards on the same road, when armed men detonated a motorcycle carrying an improvised explosive device (IED) as a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle passed by, carrying bomb disposal squad personnel to the site of the first explosion.
“Miscreants planted an IED on the motorbike and detonated it with a remote control when the CTD vehicle was passing through the area,” SSP Operations Capt (retd) Asif Khan told Dawn, adding that the CTD vehicle escaped the blast and no casualties were reported in either attack.
SSP Khan said two more explosions were reported in the evening. “One blast took place on the railway track near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, which blew up the main line connecting Quetta with other parts of the country,” he said.

No casualties reported; seven explosions occur in Quetta, Dera Murad Jamali

Police said an IED had been planted on the track and was detonated shortly before a train was exp­e­c­ted to arrive in Quetta. “Around one and a half feet of the track was blown up in the blast,” an official added. Rail traffic was suspended while repair work was initiated.
In another incident, unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at Manzoor Shaheed Police Station, but the device failed to explode. A bomb disposal squad later defused it.
Later in the evening, unidentified attackers hurled another grenade in the Kechi Beg area at a police patrol. The grenade exploded, but no casualties were reported.
Meanwhile, armed men also targeted a police vehicle at DC Chowk in Dera Murad Jamali by throwing a grenade.
The device did not explode and was defused by the bomb disposal squad. Police said the vehicle was on routine patrol when it came under attack.
In yet another incident late on Saturday night, unidentified armed men attacked the camp of a construction company in Quetta’s Sariab area.
Police said motorcyclist hurled a grenade at the site, damaging mac­h­inery and injuring a security guard, who was shif­ted to the Civil Hospital. The company is currently engaged in the construction of Sariab Road.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incidents.

KYIV/MOSCOW: Ukrainian Presi­d­ent Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation headed by security council secretary Rustem Umerov was on its way to the United States to continue talks on an agreement to end Russia’s war.
Umerov has been put in charge of the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday hours after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment.
Zelensky said he expected that the res­ults of previous meetings with the US in Geneva, which took place last weekend, would now be “hammered out” on Sunday.
Those meetings allowed Ukraine to present a counter-offer to proposals laid out by US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll to leaders in Kyiv almost two weeks ago.
“Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky wrote on X.







Yermak told the New York Post hours after his resignation that he was “going to the front”. “I am an honest and decent person,” he said.
Russian oil terminal
One of Russia’s largest oil terminals halted operations on Saturday following an attack by sea drones.
The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), a group that includes US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil and which owns the terminal, called the strike a “terrorist attack”.
Ukraine, which did not comment on the incident, has sought to punch back against its neighbour as the war grinds through its fourth year.
“As a result of a targeted terrorist attack by unmanned boats at 4:06am Moscow time (6:06 PKT) single Mooring Point 2 (SMP-2) sustained significant damage,” the CPC said in a statement on Telegram.
“Further operation of SMP-2 is not possible. Loadings at the terminal will be carried out in accordance with established rules once the drone threats are lifted,” it added.
The CPC pipeline, which begins in Kazakhstan and ends at the terminal, is a major conduit for Kazakh oil and one of the world’s largest by volume, handling around one percent of global supplies.
A Ukrainian source, meanwhile, clai­m­ed responsibility for attacks on two oil tankers in the Black Sea allegedly cover­tly transporting sanctioned Russian oil.
The two ships, the Virat and the Kairos, were rocked by explosions off Turkey’s coast late Friday, according to the Turkish transport ministry. One of the two was struck again early Saturday, the ministry said.
“Modernised Sea Baby naval drones successfully targeted the vessels,” a source in Ukraine’s SBU security service told AFP.
The source shared a video that purported to show sea drones gliding towards the two ships, before sparking explosions.
Kazakhstan’s energy ministry said on Saturday it had activated a plan to redirect oil exports to alternative routes after the CPC halted operations following the Ukrainian naval drone attack. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry called the attack unacceptable.
Strikes on Ukraine
The attack came as vast Russian overnight attack on Ukraine killed three people and wounded nearly 30, officials said on Saturday, with more than 600,000 households left without power after strikes on the grid.
President Zelensky said Russia had launched around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones in the attack.
AFP journalists in Kyiv reported a night of intense explosions that kept many in the capital awake.
In the morning, reporters saw burned out cars and apartment buildings charred from fire.
Russia, which denies targeting civilians, says it struck energy infrastructure powering the Ukraine’s military-industrial complex.

“Our position on the stabilisation force is clear that its main mandate must be monitoring the ceasefire on the ground to ensure that both sides abide by their commitments, and securing the borders of Gaza,” he said while talking to Dawn shortly after landing in Islamabad for a two-day visit during which he would discuss with Pakistani leaders a wide agenda — from consultations on conflicts, including Gaza and Sudan, and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme, to ways of intensifying economic cooperation.







His comments came after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar disclosed publicly for the first time that Islamabad had conveyed to international partners its willingness to contribute troops to the stabilisation force.
Much like Pakistan’s position that seeks to avoid involvement in the controversial issue of disarming Hamas, Abdelatty said the details of the force were still being negotiated.
“We are working with various partners, including the United States, to agree on a specific mission and mandate which should be focused on peacekeeping, not peace enforcement.
“We must agree on the countries that will contribute troops, the mission, the mandate, the guarantees, and the safeguards,” he said, noting that everything remained under discussion.
Abdelatty said Egypt is hosting a reconstruction conference on Gaza and looked to Pakistan for an expanded role.
“Regarding Gaza, we need everything from Pakistan, not only funding, but also participation from private companies in reconstruction and recovery efforts. We also need technical assistance and medical support. There are 50,000 medical cases in Gaza that require urgent intervention.
“We are expecting a more engaged role from your great country,” he added.
Abdelatty noted that both Pakistan and Egypt viewed the realisation of a Palestinian state as the only path to sustainable peace.
Gaza is not the only conflict on his agenda.
“We are also discussing other issues, including Sudan, where the situation is disastrous. We must intensify efforts to stop this ugly war and the killing of civilians.
“The same applies to other regional files, including the Iranian nuclear issue. We need de-escalation, dialogue and peaceful settlement of disputes. Egypt and Pakistan share the same views. We believe in de-escalation with Iran, resuming peaceful processes, and upholding the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
“There are no military solutions, only political and peaceful ones. We must work together for de-escalation.”
On the bilateral front, he called for scaling up economic ties. He said both countries must double trade volume, boost mutual investments, and strengthen South-South cooperation.
He noted proposals under discussion, including reformulating the Pakistan-Egypt Business Council and convening a business forum in either Karachi or Cairo to connect the private sectors of both countries.
He said Egypt and Pakistan should enhance cooperation in energy, textiles, food processing, agriculture, information technology, digitisation, artificial intelligence and petrochemicals, while also expanding collaboration on counter-terrorism, combatting illegal migration and trafficking, and pursuing defence cooperation centred on technology transfer and joint projects.</p><small>2025-11-29 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29201850be4e7d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958155/pia-not-affected-by-airbus-recall-as-airlines-race-to-fix-a320-jets' target='_blank'><strong>PIA ‘not affected’ by Airbus recall as airlines race to fix A320 jets</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan International Airlines remained unaffected even as global airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets after a recall by the European planemaker temporarily grounded aircraft in Asia and Europe and threatened travel in the United States during the busiest weekend of the year.
The recall of 6,000 planes, covering more than half of Airbus’ global A320-family fleet, is among the broadest in its 55-year history and is a blow for the planemaker weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.
“PIA has confirmed that its entire A320 fleet is not affected by this Airbus alert. PIA’s Engineering and Maintenance department is closely monitoring their fleet’s airworthiness, ensuring safe operations,” said a statement by the airlines spokesperson issued today.
Meanwhile, airlines worked through the night to make fixes after Airbus issued the emergency recall to 350 operators around the world, and global regulators directed carriers to remedy the software problem before resuming flights.
That appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe early on Saturday. The US will face high travel demand later in the day after the Thanksgiving holiday period.
“It’s not as chaotic as some people might think,” said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie, adding that airlines were always prepared for various potential disruptions. “But it does create some short-term headaches for operations.”
Airbus is also now telling airlines that emergency repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than feared likely to need hardware changes rather than the software fix.
Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages.
Fix is simple but necessary
Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.
European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected.
Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.
AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”.
India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday.
The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays.
Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.
ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.
ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320.
October incident triggered recall, sources say
Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.
Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected.
South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.
South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.
Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.
The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.
Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators.
Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs.
Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft.
Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29180216c178101.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958164/finland-to-close-embassy-in-pakistan-over-operational-and-strategic-reasons' target='_blank'><strong>Finland to close embassy in Pakistan over ‘operational and strategic’ reasons</strong></a><br><p>Finland has announced that it will be closing down its embassies in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar, citing “operational and strategic reasons,” it emerged on Saturday.
“The ministry for foreign affairs has decided to close the embassies of Finland in Islamabad, Kabul and Yangon in 2026,” said the Finnish foreign minister in a press release issued on Friday.
“The embassies will be closed for operational and strategic reasons, which are linked to changes in the countries’ political situation and their limited commercial and economic relations with Finland,” the statement added.
“Decisions on closures are made by a decree of the President of the Republic,” it said.
The ministry stated that preparations to close the embassies in the three countries have “already started” and added the missions would be closed during 2026.
The move comes as part of Finland’s “strategic review” of its network of missions.
It takes into account Finland’s foreign and security policy interests and the needs of Finland’s export promotion activities, the statement read.
“The aim is to concentrate resources on countries that are strategically important to Finland,” it added.
“We will systematically develop Finland’s network of missions abroad to meet future challenges,” Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Elina Valtonen was quoted as saying.
“Our operating environment is changing rapidly. The changes to be made will help us to build a stronger and more competitive Finland and to manage Finland’s external relations in accordance with our priorities,” she said.
The country had shut down its operations in Pakistan in 2012 as well, forced by budgetary constraints, but the mission was later reopened in 2022.
In 2023, Sweden also indefinitely closed its embassy in the capital, citing the security situation as the reason.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/291925167476f02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958159/fm-dar-says-pakistan-ready-to-join-gaza-peace-force-not-ready-to-disarm-palestinian-resistance-group-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says Pakistan ready to join Gaza peace force, ‘not ready’ to disarm Palestinian resistance group Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday said Pakistan was ready to commit its troops to the Gaza peace force, but distanced the country from any role in disarming the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.
A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
Last week, the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict in Gaza. The plan also authorises the ISF for the Palestinian enclave. Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained. However, Hamas rejected the resolution and also decried the establishment of an international force whose “mission includes the disarmament” of Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza.
The foreign minister said the matter of Hamas’ disarmament first came up during a meeting in Riyadh on the two-state solution. The foreign minister was speaking at a press conference held today at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement. We are definitely ready to contribute to the force — the prime minister has in principle already announced after consultation with the field marshal that we will contribute — but this decision can not be taken until it is decided what its [ISF] mandate and TOR (terms of reference) will be.”
“As per my information, if it will include disarming Hamas, then even my Indonesian counterpart has informally expressed his reservation.”
Dar said he was present at the initial talks when the matter of the force was raised, adding that Indonesia had offered 20,000 troops and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also signalled “in principle” that Pakistan would positively consider its participation.



The matter of any supposed role of Pakistan in disarming Hamas had elicited anger from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif last month, who had rubbished and strongly condemned contentious remarks by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry that the force’s mandate would include disarmament of Hamas.
Talking about the ISF, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad had said at the UNSC vote that it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he had said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority.
The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.
It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.
Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught.
The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced.
That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel.
Pakistan did not take kinetic action against Afghanistan at Qatar’s request
The foreign minister also talked at length about the recent flare-up and deterioration of bilateral ties with Afghanistan.
Referring to retaliatory action by Pakistan following terror attacks carried out by Afghan nationals in the country, the foreign minister said it was a mistake of the Taliban authorities to believe that Pakistan could not sort out the situation itself, saying the country had ample kinetic capabilities, but it would not be a “desirable” course of action to invade a brotherly country and neutralise problematic elements.
“The situation was possibly leading to that stage when this issue began. Qatar is a country whose foreign ministry was contacting me hourly at that time,” he said, adding that the Qatari prime and foreign minister was in touch with him “every hour”.
“They found out that we were about to take kinetic action. They requested that ‘please stop your side and we will mediate, take responsibility and get the issue resolved.’”
FM Dar added that he was grateful to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief for accepting his stance and “the cleanup operation that was about to happen that night — that would have surely taught them a lesson — was stopped”.
Despite that, he said nothing was gained from the negotiations mediated by Qatar and Turkiye, adding that the mediators were themselves frustrated by the lack of progress in the talks.
He urged Kabul’s authorities that “dialogue and diplomacy” were the only way to resolve current issues and called on the Afghan Taliban regime to reflect on its weaknesses and faults.
Referring to the shooting of two US National Guards by an Afghan national and attacks on Chinese workers in Tajikistan from Afghanistan, Dar warned that “the time is not far when Muslims and non-Muslims will unite to eliminate this terrorism”.
He said it was better for regional players to purge the area of terrorism before such a moment arrived.
The foreign minister elaborated that there was a divide in the Taliban ranks between the peacemakers and the warmongers.
Dar further said that he was working to restore delivery of relief goods, food and essential humanitarian aid “for the sake of the Afghan people” on the request of the United Nations, adding that he had secured the army chief’s nod and PM Shehbaz’s approval was awaited.
All matters nearly settled with EU monitoring mission
Talking about the current visit of a seven-member European Union delegation as part of the fifth Biennial Review of the GSP+ scheme and Pakistan’s progress so far, FM Dar said: “Nearly all of our matters have been satisfactorily handled; around six items are pending, of which it is hoped that three legislative actions will be completed in the ongoing Parliament and Senate sessions.”
Dar said he had informed EU officials in Brussels that its review group would “give a very positive report” upon their return from Pakistan.
The deputy PM expressed hope that the review would be successful.
UAE visa issues
The foreign minister also addressed the issue of UAE visas, and assured that the issue had been raised multiple times.
“We are not sleeping. This issue has been raised many times. They’ve also shown evidence that of the different nationalities involved in crime in the UAE, Pakistanis are at the top, unfortunately.”
Dar added that the issue had reached such an extent at a certain point that “even visas of officials and ministers were refused”.
He stated that he had sent the reports of mass offloading of passengers to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and would pursue the issue with him. However, seemingly justifying the action, he said it was not occurring “without reason”.
The foreign minister pointed to the issue of the begging racket, including in Saudi Arabia, that involved Pakistanis.
He said issues would not be resolved until the above matters were tackled and eliminated.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:29</small></div><hr>
