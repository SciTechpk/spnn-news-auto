Left-arm spinner Noman Ali was South Africa’s chief tormentor as Pakistan won the first Test by 93 runs. Set a daunting 277-run target for victory, the visitors and World Test champions were bowled out for 183 on day four.
“The pre-series camp was aimed at adapting spin on these types of pitches; different shots, scoring options,” Azhar said at the presser. “We’re trying that if we play this method at home, then we’ll know how to play spin.”
Azhar noted that the playing XI will be decided the morning of the match after seeing pitch conditions, saying there is a possibility of some changes, “but not too many”.
 


“With regards to the toss, we don’t want that the whole match is decided by the toss.
“I said this before the series as well, that these pitches are not West Indies pitches, this pitch played better than that one. So the aim is that even if we lose the toss, we try to make 350 (runs) in the first innings,” said Azhar, who was appointed interim coach of the men’s team in June.
When asked how important a 2-0 series win is, Azhar acknowledged the confidence boost that comes with winning against a team like South Africa.
“We hope to perform as best as we can. There is no guarantee of the result, because we need to improve our process and be consistent with our basics over a long period of time,” he said.
“When you play at home, you need to see how you’re going to take 20 wickets, whether it’s through spin or pace. Wherever we play, the aim is that we win. We have the fast-bowling ability.”
Azhar added: “Whenever the opposition comes from abroad, we can plan against them differently. The countries that struggle against spin, we’ll try to play spin and reverse against them.”
During the presser, Mahmood also cleared the air on criticism against him based on a “wrong narrative” being used against him.
 


“There’s been a lot of criticism on social media because I said last time that we don’t have quality spinners. You can see any press conference of mine and see that I said we don’t have any spinners in the squad; I never said we don’t have spinners in the country.”
Azhar also had praise for Pakistan’s batsmen, saying all seven who played scored runs and “everyone played their part.
“Unfortunately our lower order did not perform, so we expect that they not only perform with the ball. You must have seen in the previous series as well that Noman, Sajid performed well, so Hassan Ali can bat, Shaheen can bat.
“The top seven is the top seven, but the lower order runs matter as well, which we didn’t do in the previous test,” Azhar said, adding that South Africa made 90 runs in their last four wickets.
“We’re playing against the best team and they’re obviously not going to take this lightly, they’ll give it their all to comeback; they were relying heavily on one of their spinners, who’s one of the best in the world. It’ll bring a lot of challenges for us.
“In the camp, we had thought of all kinds of challenges that would come, of [Keshav] Maharaj, of Rabada, so we prepared accordingly.

The preparation is done, now it’s time to execute.

“We know what challenges will come, and we need to see how to tackle those. On the day, it’s all about execution and making the right decision when you bat, bowl or field,” Mahmood said.
With regards to winning the World Test Championship, he said Pakistan is playing six Test matches at home.
“Obviously, we need to go step by step to reach there — you need to play in conditions abroad, play in West Indies, Bangladesh, England. So the process that I keep talking about, we need to take the matches one by one. With Test matches we’ll take it session by session.
“This team has been playing for quite some time now, the boys’ morale is quite high, they knew it was important to win the match and you saw the effort they put in. They’re confident and they’re all getting along well and playing together. This is what a team needs to build up,” he said.
Spinner Maharaj to return for South Africa against Pakistan
South Africa have been boosted by the return of leading spinner Keshav Maharaj to the team for the second test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi as they seek to level the series, captain Aiden Markram said on Sunday.
Maharaj, 35, was recovering from a groin injury and missed the first test in Lahore.
“Obviously, its great to have him back in the camp, Markram told a press conference on Sunday.
 


He brings lots of experience and a really good skill set as well, so we’re looking forward to this game starting tomorrow, which is an opportunity for us to level the series, but also to keep improving in these conditions and fixing some of the stuff that we feel needs fixing from the first game.”
Maharaj’s 203 wickets in 59 tests make him South Africa’s most successful spin bowler.
The clash in Lahore was dominated by the spinners on a slow turning surface, and Markram is expecting the same from the pitch at Rawalpindi.
“We’re expecting it to spin. We’ve expected those types of conditions from day one, and it’s about us having done some homework post the first test and coming up with new plans to hopefully counter that and give ourselves a chance of succeeding in these conditions.
“I suppose when you get to spinning conditions, the guessing game is always how long until it really starts to spin exaggeratedly,” Markram said.
South Africa had three spinners in their line-up last week, and Maharajs return is likely to lead to Simon Harmer, Senuran Muthusamy or Prenelan Subrayen being dropped.
Pakistan’s victory in Lahore ended a 10-match winning streak in test cricket for South Africa.</p><small>2025-10-19 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19204006a45e264.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949957/interior-minister-briefs-pm-shehbaz-on-law-and-order-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister briefs PM Shehbaz on law and order situation</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi briefed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the law and order situation in the country as the two met on Sunday, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.
The statement added that PM Shehbaz was also briefed on the development projects under way in Islamabad.
Today’s meeting between the premier and the interior minister comes a week after they had met ahead of a police operation to dismantle the protest camp of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Muridke.
The TLP planned to march on Islamabad and hold a demonstration outside the US embassy there in “solidarity with Gaza”.
Naqvi had briefed PM Shehbaz on the overall law and order situation across the country during last week’s meeting as well and had told him that measures were being undertaken by the Ministry of Interior to strengthen internal security.
For his part, the premier had appreciated the efforts of the interior minister and his team, directing that coordinated and effective actions must continue to ensure the protection of citizens’ lives and property.
Reaffirming his government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz had said that safeguarding the lives and property of the people, upholding the rule of law and eradicating terrorism remained the government’s top priorities.
Punjab Police on high alert at Christian services
In a statement, the Punjab Police said it remained on high alert and performed security duties at churches across the province during Christian worship and prayer services.
On the orders of Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar, regional and district police officers were instructed to enhance the security at churches.
“He (Punjab IG) said that supervisory officers should personally inspect the security arrangements of churches and other important places,” the statement read.
“Additional police personnel and snipers should be deployed at sensitive churches, while Dolphin Squad, PRU (Police Response Unit) and Elite Force teams should ensure effective patrolling around churches.”
According to the statement, all deployed police officers and personnel were instructed to remain vigilant and closely monitor any “suspicious or miscreant elements”. It added that search and sweep operations around churches, Christian communities and sensitive locations should continue.
“Dr Usman Anwar said that religious scholars, the Christian community, and members of peace committees should play their active role in promoting interfaith harmony,” the statement read.
“He further added that [the] Punjab Police has established Mesaaq Centres for addressing the issues of the Christian community and all other minorities so that their problems can be resolved on a priority basis.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191917017424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949953/lahore-ranks-second-most-polluted-city-in-world-in-terms-of-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality on Sunday, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI reading for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
 


Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were measured at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time last year, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘smog guns’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1911361470e6c73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949908/suparco-launches-countrys-first-hyperspectral-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>Suparco launches country’s first ‘hyperspectral satellite’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Sunday launched its first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from a Chinese launch centre, the country’s space agency said, describing it as “a breakthrough achievement”.
Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
In a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Detailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”
“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.
“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”
It added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.
Per the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.
Chairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.
“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”
Underscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”
“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”
According to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.
He also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.
“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.
“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.
According to the statement,  the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.
“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”
Separately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”
 






FO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”
It also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.
On October 15, Suparco announced the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.
In July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.
In August, Pakistan successfully launched a remote sensing satellite from a launch centre in China. The satellite aimed to strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities, according to a Foreign Office statement.</p><small>2025-10-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191722203f9fa7a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949933/australia-storm-past-india-as-returning-rohit-kohli-fail-in-opening-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Australia storm past India as returning Rohit, Kohli fail in opening ODI</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s stand-in captain Mitchell Marsh continued his fine run of form on Sunday, scoring 46 not out and leading his side to a seven-wicket triumph over India in the weather-affected first One-day international at Perth Stadium.
India limped to 136-9 from 26 overs, interrupted four times by rain, setting Australia a revised target of 131, which the hosts reached in 21.1 overs.
The sea of blue in the 42,423-strong crowd did not have to wait to see Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli after India were put into bat.
 






Having retired from the game’s other formats with an eye on the 2027 World Cup, the former captains made their return to national duty for the first time since winning the Champions Trophy in March.
Neither looked convincing against Australia’s pace bowlers, with Rohit edging Josh Hazlewood to second slip on eight and Kohli cutting Mitchell Starc to a diving Cooper Connolly at backward point for an eight-ball duck.
“All of their batters are world-class and legends of the game,” said spinner Matthew Kuhnemann, who picked up 2-26. “In one-day cricket, especially, to get wickets up front makes a massive difference.”
Newly appointed one-day skipper Shubman Gill (10) tickled seamer Nathan Ellis to wicketkeeper Josh Philippe, leaving India reeling at 37-3 when light drizzle halted play for two hours.
The crowd applauded sarcastically when the covers were removed, then in earnest when Shreyas Iyer (11) slashed Hazlewood to the fence. The bowler got his revenge two balls later, however, as Philippe took another leg-side catch.
Medium-pacer Mitch Owen and spinner Matthew Kuhnemann kept up the pressure and halted any momentum Axar Patel (31) and KL Rahul (38) generated, although Nitish Kumar Reddy brought some excitement with a rapid 19 off 11 balls.
Deputising for Pat Cummins, whose Ashes hopes remain uncertain due to a back injury, Marsh kick-started Australia’s reply by bludgeoning three sixes, carrying over impressive form against South Africa and New Zealand.
Philippe, playing his first ODI since 2021 due to the absence of Josh Inglis and Alex Carey, supported his skipper with an aggressive 37 before holing out to Arshdeep Singh in the deep.
Matt Renshaw helped his team home with 21 not out, while Singh, Patel and Washington Sundar claimed one wicket apiece.
“We knew we didn’t have that many runs, but we just wanted to express ourselves,” Arshdeep said.
The series moves to Adelaide on Thursday before concluding in Sydney on Saturday.</p><small>2025-10-19 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1919165796cd0df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949952/two-women-killed-30-injured-as-coaster-collides-with-mountainside-in-kps-haripur-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Two women killed, 30 injured as coaster collides with mountainside in KP’s Haripur: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Two women were killed and 30 others were injured on Sunday when a coaster carrying a wedding party collided with the mountainside on Jab road in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur, according to Rescue 1122.
A Rescue 1122 statement said the accident took place due to brake failure.
Subsequently, four Rescue 1122 ambulances and a rescue vehicle were sent to the site, it said, adding that the bodies and most of the injured were taken to Trauma Centre Haripur. Two of the injured whose condition was critical were sent to Abbottabad.
In a similar incident in late September, 11 deaths were reported after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan. Three people were also injured in the accident, which a Rescue 1122 spokesperson attributed to brake failure.
In another accident the same month on September 9, two women had died while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in KP’s Mansehra.
This was two day after five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur. The accident had taken place when a trailer en route to Rawalpindi collided with a car near the Maqsood Interchange on the motorway.</p><small>2025-10-19 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1904552284939c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949845/pakistan-afghanistan-agree-to-immediate-ceasefire-after-doha-talks-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to immediate ceasefire after Doha talks: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following high-level negotiations in Doha, where both countries pledged to respect each other’s sovereignty and are expected to meet again on October 25 to further discuss matters, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday.
Amid heightened tensions along the Pak-Afghan border, a high-level Pakistani delegation led by Asif travelled to Doha on Saturday for talks with Afghan Taliban officials, aimed at ending cross-border hostilities and addressing Pakistan’s security concerns.  Facilitated by Qatar, the talks followed days of clashes and Pakistani strikes on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, after a 48-hour ceasefire was extended to allow negotiations.
In a post on X, the minister announced, “A ceasefire agreement has been finalised. The terrorist attacks from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will cease immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory,” adding that delegations will meet again in Istanbul on October 25 to discuss matters in detail.
“We are sincerely grateful to both brotherly countries, Qatar and Turkiye,” the minister said.
 






Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar welcomed the announcement, calling it a “step in the right direction.”
Taking to X, FM Dar said, “[I] welcome the agreement finalised late last night in Doha. It is the first step in the right direction.”
 






“Deeply appreciate the constructive role played by brotherly Qatar and Turkiye,’ he added.
Dar expressed hope for the establishment of a “concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism” to tackle terrorism “emanating from Afghan soil” in the upcoming Istanbul meeting.
He stressed that “it is important to put all efforts in place to prevent any further loss of lives.”
Separately, the spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Zabiullah Mujahid, in a statement issued on Sunday, said: “Negotiations between representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, held in Qatar, have concluded with the signing of a bilateral agreement.”
 






“Under the terms of the agreement, both sides reaffirm their commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the maintenance of strong and constructive [neighbourly] relations,” the statement added.
As per the statement, both countries mutually agreed that “neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan.”
“Both sides will refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” it added.
Underscoring commitment towards diplomacy, the statement said: “Both sides are committed to resolving issues and disputes through dialogue”, detailing that “a comprehensive and meaningful ceasefire has been mutually agreed upon.”
“In the future, a mechanism will be established, under the mediation of intermediary countries, to review bilateral claims and ensure the effective implementation of this agreement,” it said.
The spokesperson also extended appreciation to Qatar and Turkiye for their role in facilitating the agreement.
In a subsequent post, he referred to the phrase “nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan” in his earlier statement. Mujahid clarified that it had been the the permanent position of  the Islamic Emirate that “it does not allow the use of Afghan territory against any other country”.
“It (The Islamic Emirate) does not support any attack against anyone and has always emphasised this stance,” he added.
 






Earlier, a post on the X account of PTV News, citing the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had also confirmed the development.
 






“During the talks, both countries not only agreed on an immediate ceasefire but also decided to establish a permanent mechanism for bilateral peace and stability,” the post said.
The post further noted that both countries will hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the implementation and sustained continuity of the ceasefire.
“These measures will prove beneficial in promoting security and stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,” it said.
According to the post, the negotiations, hosted by the State of Qatar with Turkiye acting as mediator, continued for 13 hours.
On Saturday, as talks were underway between the two sides, Pakistan had reiterated that it did not seek escalation. However, it urged the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities, a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) had said.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,“ it had added.
Cross-border escalation
On the night of October 11, Afghan forces launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, sparking a series of clashes that left 23 Pakistani soldiers martyred and over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants dead, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The Pakistan military responded with precision strikes inside Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul, targeting militant camps and border positions, while urging Kabul to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Clashes broke out again on Tuesday (Oct.14), with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
Deteriorating ties
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have remained strained since 2023, with Pakistan repeatedly raising concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants carrying out cross-border attacks. The security situation has deteriorated further in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan following the outlawed TTP’s decision to end its ceasefire with Islamabad in November 2022.
While the two sides have attempted to hold dialogue from time to time, tensions have persisted. Kabul, while insisting that it does not permit its territory to be used against any country, continues to face criticism from Islamabad as TTP-led assaults continue in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-19 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1914351690e2b39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949922/jewellery-stolen-from-louvre-priceless-says-french-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Jewellery stolen from Louvre ‘priceless’, says French minister</strong></a><br><p>France’s Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said that jewellery stolen from the Louvre Museum on Sunday in Paris was “priceless”.
The minister told French news outlets France Inter, France Info and Le Monde that “three or four” thieves had focused on two displays in the exhibition venue’s “Gallerie d’Apollon” (“Apollo’s Gallery”), completing their broad daylight robbery in just seven minutes.
Earlier in the day, France’s Culture Minister Rachida Dati reported a break-in at the Louvre in Paris, as the world-renowned museum said it was closing for the day.
“A hold-up took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,” she wrote on X, using a French word that can also mean “robbery”.
“No injuries reported. I’m on site with museum staff and police,” she added.
 






At least one person had entered the museum, a member of her team told AFP, without adding anything about any possible theft.
The Louvre said it was closing for the day “for exceptional reasons”.
The museum was not immediately available for comment.</p><small>2025-10-19 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191458571db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949923/kp-cm-afridi-calls-for-a-grand-peace-jirgah-on-oct-25' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi calls for a grand peace jirgah on Oct 25</strong></a><br><p>The newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has called for a grand peace jirgah on October 25, in the province’s Khyber district, in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province.
In a statement on X, Afridi said, “For the establishment of peace, a grand peace jirga of tribal elders, leaders, and youth — transcending  political affiliations — will be held on Saturday, October 25, 2025, in Khyber District, Bara Tehsil.”
Stressing the need for prioritising the will of KP’s people in deciding the matters of the province, he said, “The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will themselves decide their lives and their future.”
“No one will be allowed to impose decisions made in closed rooms on the people,” he said, vowing that the KP government “will stand with Imran Khan’s ideology and the interests of the people.”
 






The development comes as the province witnesses a rise in terrorist attacks, which escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
In July, Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund in KP, which was then opposed by the provincial government of KP.
In July, a jirga was organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga.
In August, former KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced a series of jirgas to oppose the military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre.
The recommendations by the Jirga were to ensure unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”</p><small>2025-10-19 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19140132cba4f56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949918/over-433-million-children-vaccinated-against-polio-in-first-5-days-of-campaign-neoc' target='_blank'><strong>Over 43.3 million children vaccinated against polio in first 5 days of campaign: NEOC</strong></a><br><p>Over 43.3 million children of up to five years of age have been vaccinated against polio in the first five days of an anti-polio campaign across the country, the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) said on Saturday, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.
Yesterday’s data reported that more than 22.9m children have received the oral polio vaccine in Punjab, while approximately 10.2m children were immunised in Sindh.
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, more than 6.1m children have been vaccinated … in Balochistan, over 2.5m; in Islamabad, around 443,000; in Gilgit-Baltistan, nearly 294,000 and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, over 733,000 children have received the vaccine,” Radio Pakistan added.
Of those that received the vaccine in Punjab over the first six days of the campaign, over 2.2m were in Lahore, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said on Sunday.
The ongoing week-long anti-polio campaign in Lahore was launched under the vision of Punjab’s Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif for a Zero Polio Punjab.
According to Radio Pakistan, the ongoing national campaign aims to vaccinate over 45m children and is set to run uninterrupted until today. Meanwhile, in South KP, the campaign is scheduled to begin tomorrow (Monday).
The NEOC urged parents to ensure that every child under five years of age receives the polio vaccine, the outlet added.
Progress meeting
A review meeting to assess the progress of the Punjab campaign was held under the chairmanship of Lahore’s Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza at his office on Sunday, according to APP.
The meeting was attended by the additional deputy commissioner (general), Chief Executive Officer (Health) Dr Asif Arbab, assistant commissioners, officials from the health department, and observers from the World Health Organisation (WHO).
During the meeting, Arbab said that more than 2.212m children had been vaccinated across the provincial capital so far, while an additional 73,900 children who had missed out were covered during the first catch-up day. The district administration and health teams remained fully active in the field to achieve the set targets, he added.
Arbab further informed the meeting that the campaign achieved over 99 per cent of its target with more than 1.559m households successfully covered, marking the coverage rate as over 95pc. The WHO representatives expressed satisfaction over the overall performance of the district teams and appreciated the dedication and commitment of field staff working tirelessly to eradicate the crippling disease.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza emphasised that the anti-polio campaign must be made a complete success in every respect. He directed all Assistant Commissioners to minimise the number of missed-out children and instructed the Deputy District Health Officers (DDHOs) to ensure strict field monitoring.
 
 

He also said that 100pc coverage must be ensured in schools, adding that any operational issues were to be reported immediately to the district administration for prompt action.
“All children under five years of age must be vaccinated; achieving the targets is mandatory,” the DC stressed, warning that officers failing to meet their targets would be held accountable.
“Making Lahore polio-free is a shared responsibility. We must perform our national duty for the sake of our children’s future,” he added.
Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress. Over 200,000 polio workers and supervisors are participating in the current drive across Punjab.
Data from September showed that the number of children remaining unvaccinated due to parental refusals had come down in their recent immunisation drive compared to the previous campaign.
However, the global polio monitoring board issued a warning that efforts to eradicate the disease were failing as a new polio case confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad the same month brought the nationwide tally to 27 this year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
In August, two new poliovirus cases were reported, involving a six-year-old girl from KP’s Kohistan district and a 21-month-old girl from Sindh’s Badin.
Earlier that month, poliovirus was found in 36pc of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.</p><small>2025-10-19 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1913085896107b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949914/pakistans-jf-17-block-iii-jets-touch-down-in-azerbaijan-for-bilateral-aerial-combat-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s JF-17 Block-III jets touch down in Azerbaijan for bilateral aerial combat exercise</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, has landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
Pakistan regularly participates in bilateral and multilateral air exercises with countries around the world, showcasing its growing aerial capabilities and fostering military cooperation. These exercises allow the PAF to train in diverse operational environments, enhance interoperability with foreign forces, and demonstrate its cutting-edge aircraft and skilled personnel on the international stage. Such engagements also strengthen defence diplomacy and strategic ties with partner nations.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aims to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.

“In a remarkable display of operational prowess and endurance, PAF fighters accomplished a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Azerbaijan, executing flawless in-flight air-to-air refuelling operations,” the statement said.
“The intricate mid-air refuelling operation, executed with utmost precision by PAF’s own IL-78 aerial tanker, reaffirmed the long-range capability of PAF fighter jets and showcased the professional excellence and preparedness of PAF aircrew to undertake extended international deployments.”
Per the statement, the exercise will focus on modern aerial warfare tactics, joint mission planning and execution in an environment shaped by rapid technological advancements and evolving airpower dynamics.
It will also serve as a vital platform to exchange operational insights and strengthen collaborative responses to emerging aerial defence challenges.
The statement continued: “The participation of the Pakistan Air Force contingent in Exercise Indus Shield Alpha reaffirms PAF’s enduring commitment to regional stability and global military cooperation.
“It also demonstrates PAF’s unwavering resolve to continuously evolve and adapt to the demands of contemporary warfare, while maintaining its tradition of excellence in every domain of air operations.”
In July, PAF fighter jets won top awards in two categories at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025 in the United Kingdom. The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the “Spirit of the Meet Trophy” for its “striking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling. The C-130H Hercules was awarded the “Concours d’Elegance Trophy”.
Last year, PAF conducted Exercise Indus Shield-2024, the largest multinational regional exercise with 24 countries taking part in it. The exercise aimed to foster interoperability and training through state-of-the-art facilities. According to the ISPR,  the event saw the participation of various air chiefs and high-ranking military officials from allied countries to witness the mega event.
The exercise highlighted the premier multi-domain warfighting capabilities of the PAF and reinforced the importance of collaboration among air forces worldwide.</p><small>2025-10-19 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19094906c43a0c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949810/karachi-hyderabad-face-dengue-outbreak-as-cases-spike-alarmingly' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi, Hyderabad face dengue outbreak as cases spike alarmingly</strong></a><br><p>• Health dept data suggests all is well on dengue front in Sindh with just 819 confirmed cases
• Figures obtained from four Karachi hospital show 2,972 positive cases reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16
• One public sector Hyderabad lab confirms 9,075 dengue cases between Sept 1 and Oct 14
• Govt says 215,270 malaria cases also reported this year in province
KARACHI / HYDERABAD: While the provincial health department puts the total number of dengue cases in Sindh this year at 819, figures obtained by three major Karachi hospitals and one public sector laboratory and its branches in Hyderabad suggest an outbreak-like situation, with the actual number exceeding 12,000 in a short span of just six weeks.
The government had confirmed one dengue-related death in July, but independent figures suggest four dengue patients in Hyderabad —a young girl and two men and an elderly woman — and two in Karachi had lost their lives after testing positive to the mosquito-borne disease.
As the government remained tight-lipped over the large data discrepancy, a senior Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) official cast doubts over the credibility of officials figures, saying their stats did not represent the ground reality.
Grim situation in Karachi, Hyderabad
According to official figures released by the health services director general, the total number of dengue confirmed cases in Karachi division and Hyderabad district this year was 579 and 119, respectively.
However, figures collected from three hospitals in Karachi — Indus Hospital (IH), Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) and the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre (SIDHRC) — showed that a total of 2,972 cases of dengue have been reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16. The fourth hospital — the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre — alone recorded 1,062 dengue cases from July to date.
The situation is no different at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) as sources confirmed a high number of dengue cases, comparatively larger than the last year’s, and a few deaths.
Hyderabad is facing an alarming situation as the figures obtained from the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory (DRL) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro and its branches showed 9,075 dengue confirmed cases from Sept 1 to Oct 14.
Question mark over credibility of govt data
PMA-Sindh President Dr Bashir Ahmed Khaskheli described the situation far more serious than what’s depicted by official data and said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.
“There is no official mechanism in place to get feedback from private clinics operating in every nook and corner of a locality as well as private hospitals, quacks and even hakeems. Many people constrained by their financial resources don’t even opt for laboratory tests,” he told Dawn.
Dr Faisal Mahmood, professor of infectious diseases and associate chief medical officer at the AKUH, also confirmed the surge in dengue cases, emphasising that the end of October was classically the season when most dengue cases were seen.
Talking to Dawn, he said: “It is important to note that dengue rates do vary from year to year, and this cyclic pattern of dengue peaks is something we have seen over the last decade or so. There are several reasons for this including weather patterns and changes in the strains. What is driving this year is hard to say, though I would think the [rains] floods have played a part.”
Dr Mahmood avoided making an observation on the disease severity, pointing out that the city was in the middle of the (dengue) season.
Prof Dr Imran Shaikh, a seasoned physician and dean faulty of medicine in LUMHS, said: “We had cases in June and July but nobody traced them. Burden of positive case has increased immensely since September. It is yet to show a declining trend.”
Alarming rise in malaria cases
According to the health department’s data, 215,270 cases of malaria have been reported this year across the province and the number of cases reported in Karachi from January 1 to Oct 15 stands at 3,072.
The official data shows the worst malaria-affected cities are: Jamshoro 22,293, Larkana 19,835, followed by Jacobabad 17,170, Badin 19,478, Mirpurkhas 12,699, Shaheed Benazirabad 12,467, Thatta 10,995, Tando Muhammad Khan 10,579, Khairpur 9,967, Sanghar 7,409, Hyderabad 7,054, Tando Allah Yar 6,702, Matiari 6,064, Shikarpur 6,875, Tharparkar 4,297, Kashmore 4,292, Qambar Shahdadkot 3,866, Sukkur 4,187, Naushehro Feroze 3,563, Ghotki 2,867 and Umerkot 2,327.
However, information gathered from different private and public sector hospitals contradicted the official data.
Figures collected from Indus Hospital, SIDHRC, LNH, and JPMC showed that over 1,800 cases of malaria had been reported in the city from Sept 1 to Oct 16.
According to Dr Faisal Mahmood of the AKUH, malaria has seen at least a month early onset this year.
Ineffective fumigation
Health experts have attributed the surge in dengue cases to lack of fumigation and timely drainage of water accumulated after the heavy spells of monsoon rains.
“If rainwater remains accumulated, it has the potential to become a breeding ground for vectors,” said Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the PMA. “Entire rainwater doesn’t go into drains, and in many areas, water stands in the shape of ponds, only to serve as a home for mosquitoes,” he said.
Dr Khaskheli, the incumbent PMA-Sindh president, regretted that the high number of cases due to mosquito-borne illnesses could be easily prevented through effective vector control measures.
 
 

“It’s all has to do with poor sewerage and drainage system. One could see pools of standing rainwater or sewage and heaps of garbage everywhere, providing breeding grounds of all kinds of germs and insects,” he said and pointed that there were few government fumigation campaigns to effectively address the menace of vector-borne diseases.
Anti-dengue campaign intensified: minister
There was no response from the health department when its spokesperson was contacted to explain the large discrepancy in data, suggesting that actual numbers of dengue and malaria cases would be much higher.
However, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho urged the general public to take ownership of their localities and ensure that there no pools of stagnant water.
“The government is taking comprehensive measures to curb the spread of the disease. Anti-dengue campaigns have been intensified across all divisions, including Karachi, where fumigation and spraying operations are being carried out on a daily basis. Hospitals have been instructed to provide special medical attention and immediate treatment to dengue patients,” she said in a statement.
She added that health department teams were closely monitoring suspected and confirmed cases across all districts and were working jointly with the district administrations to take immediate preventive and remedial actions.

Some of the prominent ones include Procter & Gamble, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10 percent annually, over the last two years.
 
 

The gradual exodus of MNCs from Pakistan is a multifaceted affair that cannot be viewed through a mundane political lens. It is a mix of evolving strategies at a global or regional level for the respective entity, as well as a lacklustre economic and investment environment locally.
This write-up explores how the business models of MNCs have evolved over the years and how a shift in global trade is catalysing the exodus. There is also some introspection about how consistently elevated sovereign risk, and one of the more regressive taxation regimes in the world, has pushed any kind of formal business over the edge in Pakistan.

Even as the government touts policies to attract foreign investment, a number of multinational giants have been scaling back or exiting from Pakistan in recent times. What is going on here?
Is this the global economic environment at play or does this reflect deep fractures in the
country’s economic and regulatory framework? And can anything be done about it?

HISTORIC CONTEXT
Many MNCs that exist in developing markets were birthed by parent entities operating in those areas, mostly to serve the interests of colonial powers, or to consolidate the same.
As  the sun started to set on colonialism after World War II, the emperor got new clothes, the MNC in this case, and they all got a makeover, trying to shy away from a troubled history. It can be an MNC that sold soaps and was notorious for operating palm plantations through bonded labour in Central Africa, or an MNC that basically led the Nazi war machine but now sells innocuous chemicals.
The history of MNCs has been dramatic and they have evolved with time. Only recently, after 355 years in operations, did the Hudson’s Bay Company shut down, after laying the foundations of Canada through trading fur across the Atlantic and eventually morphing into its largest landowner — only to be succeeded by a chain of department stores that were killed by e-commerce. They could survive multiple wars and the death of the Empire, but could not survive the post-pandemic transition to e-commerce shopping.
During the late 2000s, there was a similar mass exodus of financial institutions, not just from Pakistan but from other developing markets as well. This was largely due to higher compliance costs and the realisation that the only way to give economic returns to shareholders was to scale up and become one of the top five institutions in the respective country. It is only through scale that one can extract economic returns; without scale, they struggle and keep losing market share.
Many of these institutions survived the Opium Wars in China, and others, only to be forced to scale down by activist shareholders. Currently, only one bank from the times of the Empire continues to exist as a shell of its former self, while the rest have exited not just Pakistan but other emerging markets as well.
 


THE CHINESE CENTURY
The current wave of MNC exits can be partially attributed to the emergence of China as the world’s factory. This led to production of goods at a scale never seen before, and with scale comes lower cost. In emerging markets with relatively low household incomes, cost competitiveness remains critical and China provided the same.
Most MNCs operating in Pakistan, or those that have left, were largely involved in production of low value-added or primary products. Making diapers, washing detergent, or a basic generic drug does not require sophisticated knowledge or skill that cannot be replicated elsewhere. As China continued to compete on cost, local production became increasingly uncompetitive.
This led to the emergence of local brands that competed on price and made the overall competitive environment more intense. MNCs, instead of doubling down and attempting to scale, figured it might be easier to shut down operations and revert to a distribution model. Why bother manufacturing when you can import and trade the same? This is where the industrial policy of the country completely failed.
In many cases of consumer goods, some MNCs even produced advertisements at scale in Southeast Asia, assuming that all people of the Subcontinent look the same, subtly mocking actual paying consumers in the process. One can mock consumers only for so long and, in the case of primary products, consumers are often very price sensitive — a strong brand can compensate only to a certain extent for a price-conscious customer. As local brands started to prop up, the operating space for MNCs became further constrained, eventually leading to a point where the consumer gravitated towards local brands.
‘GREED IS GOOD’
The fictional character, Gordon Gekko, uttered the famous words “Greed is good” in the film Wall Street, while exemplifying the role of free markets in arriving at an optimal solution that benefits everyone and shareholders the most. In matters of capital allocation, shareholders lately are not swayed by emotional concepts such as patriotism or nationalism.
More recently, German engineering and chemical behemoths started moving out of Germany to the US and other jurisdictions where energy costs were lower — not because they were any less German, but because they were losing the competitive advantage provided by cheap Russian gas, which stopped following the initiation of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Similarly, a large number of financial institutions and energy companies moved their headquarters from the UK to other jurisdictions post-Brexit. A shareholder is more interested in how their economic returns can be maximised and makes decisions accordingly. Any other considerations may be noble but are noise at best. If a jurisdiction cannot provide the requisite economic returns, the MNC (or any rational business) will eventually shut down that business.
In the absence of perpetual state subsidies, or protection as a perpetual infant, which are hallmarks of economic policies in Pakistan, no business can survive without being competitive in the local environment.
INVEST IN PAKISTAN? WHY?
Now let’s turn our attention specifically to Pakistan’s economic environment.
An economy’s gross domestic product (GDP) is a function of private consumption, government consumption, investments and net trade (more exports and fewer imports). The cumulative sum of all these factors leads to the calculation of GDP. Over the last 10 years, Pakistan has evolved into a consumption-oriented economy, wherein 99 percent of our GDP is essentially consumption.
To provide more context, for a typical lower middle-income economy, consumption makes up 81 percent of GDP, while the average for South Asia is 72 percent of GDP. This effectively means that we do not invest, produce, or export a lot — we just import and consume.
As we import more, we need more foreign currency, because that is how one buys imports, and when there isn’t much foreign currency available, this leads to the Pakistani rupee (PKR) losing its value, triggering a spurt of inflation before it settles, only for this Groundhog Day situation to repeat again.  If saner heads do not prevail, we may see the same happening again within the next 18 months.
Before we can produce anything, we need to invest in productive capacity first. The Investment-to-GDP ratio for Pakistan has consistently remained in the range of 12 percent, while that for South Asia is 32 percent, and for lower middle-income countries, it is 30 percent. If Pakistan ever wants to be a middle-income country, it needs to achieve and maintain an Investment-to-GDP ratio in the range of 25-30 percent consistently.
It is only through investment in productive capacity that we can produce more, create more jobs and generate an economic spillover effect that leads to improved household incomes. No country has ever become a middle-income economy, or better, without investing in itself. There is literally no other way — it is simply not possible to become prosperous just through consumption.
Investment in an economy is mostly a domestic affair, but we have it completely flipped. The government and its coterie of sycophants continue to beat the drums of foreign direct investment (FDI) without any introspection. For lower middle-income economies, FDI makes up around four percent of total investment, while for selected middle-income countries’ economies, it hovers in the range of five to 12 percent of total investment.
Only in the case of Vietnam is FDI maintained in the range of 12 percent. Effectively, domestic investment makes up more than 90 percent of investment across the board, a fact we completely ignore in the rush to sign off another Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which is as good as exchanging business cards at a conference.
There is absolutely no reason why foreign capital would gravitate towards an economy where domestic investors are also reluctant to invest. Even when they do invest, they invest in non-productive segments, such as real-estate, largely due to an atrociously regressive taxation policy that penalises formal investment, production and value-added initiatives.
Digging deeper, investment is largely a function of savings, and given the state of financial exclusion and an inefficient taxation regime, there is little to no incentive to save through formal financial channels, resulting in a scenario where most savings find their way to inefficient avenues, such as real estate, stashing cash under the mattress, or gold.
None of these generate any worthwhile economic activity that can boost production. The investment problem cannot be solved without addressing the savings problem first. Policymakers currently continue to focus only on foreign direct investment, which does not solve any problem.
In a dysfunctional investment environment, the case to continue and expand operations in Pakistan remains weak. And it is further weakened through heightened sovereign risk, whether due to border skirmishes or the musical chairs that accompany leadership changes, eventually resulting in policy inconsistency.
 


THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS
The cost of doing business formally in Pakistan is much higher than the cost of doing business informally.
For example, an entity operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space formally has to comply with all taxation and other financial or legal constraints. This can include a direct tax that can go as high as 40 percent, a contribution to the Workers’ Welfare Fund or Workers’ Profit Participation Fund that can exceed seven percent of Profit Before Tax, and a dividend tax of 15 percent. The effective tax an entity in the formal sphere pays exceeds 50 percent of its Profit Before Tax, even though the company is taking market risk.
Such an effective tax rate is much higher than in many developed economies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) effective tax rate is 25.4 percent, while the highest is 34.8 percent in Columbia. In such a scenario, there is little reason for any entity to operate formally in an environment where half of its profitability is simply gobbled up by the State.
Similarly, any such company operating formally also has to comply with all Sales Tax requirements which, at 17 percent, are among the highest in the world, effectively discouraging more goods from coming into the taxation net. Meanwhile, any entity operating informally and selling smuggled goods can completely avoid paying this Sales Tax, effectively cannibalising the sales of the entity operating in the formal sphere.
Such a structure is so lopsided that an MNC operating formally and selling goods while paying all taxes may be cannibalised by the same goods it is selling, but which are either smuggled or imported at a lower tax rate, wherein the distributor and retailer can avoid paying Sales Tax through one way or another. Effectively, FMCG companies get cannibalised by their own products, due to an inefficient and perverse taxation regime.

DETERIORATING REAL INCOMES
Pakistan has been plagued by economic stagnation for the last seven years, if not more. Whenever an MNC enters a country, the expectation is that overall prosperity levels will gradually increase and so will household incomes. Due to economic stagnation, however, per capita income levels have actually gone down in American dollar terms. Moreover, adjusting for the tax burden, real income after tax has gone down even more.
Over a seven-year period, real income has effectively gone down by 45-50 percent and, after adjusting the same for taxes, it has gone down by more than 50 percent, with households across the spectrum (with the rare exception of those right at the top) losing half their disposable income.
It is estimated that expenditure on food made up 47 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2017-18.  Expenditure on food now makes up about 65 percent of the poorest 20 percent of households’ budget in 2024-25. This effectively means that more expenditure is being reallocated to meet basic existential needs, squeezing away demand from other areas, such as health and education.  Effectively, there is less disposable income to go around, which means a lower demand for products.
For a market such as Pakistan, an MNC typically introduces the lowest-margin and most basic quality of products. As real income levels go down, so does demand for such products. The demand drops so much that entities have to resort to ‘shrinkflation’ — reducing the size of a product while not increasing prices. Shrinkflation implies moving down the value chain rather than going up — and that is a death knell for any growth-oriented entity.
The earlier notion that economic growth may lead to prosperity and higher income levels, eventually leading to demand for higher-margin and slightly more premium products, falls flat. Due to such a scenario, MNCs can see their revenue and profitability decline in American dollar terms while, at a shareholder level, this is seen as ineffective allocation of capital that can be reallocated elsewhere or returned to shareholders as dividends.

A THRIVING GREY MARKET
MNCs have to operate within a framework of compliance, even though their history may be dotted with all sorts of ethical discrepancies. As an example, in the case of petroleum products, there was a massive surge in the flow of gasoline and diesel from Pakistan’s western border through informal channels. The impact of such a flow led to a sharp reduction in the official sale of gasoline and diesel in 2022-23.
Officially, gasoline sales dropped by 20.6 percent, while diesel sales dropped by 37.1 percent in Sindh. We are specifically focusing on Sindh here because it provides granular details and is more transparent with public dissemination of data. The sale of petroleum products is a fairly stable metric — a significant drop implies substitution of the same with another product, or a product that is not captured by the formal economy.
As sales of smuggled petroleum products increased, it became increasingly difficult for MNCs to compete. Many petrol stations could simply blend formal and smuggled products, pretending nothing was happening, and capture the delta that emerged from taxes, which had to be paid on formal goods but not on smuggled products.
As such activity took hold, MNCs started losing market share, while reputational risk became ever more apparent, potentially leading to heavier penalties elsewhere. Inadvertently, in such a scenario, an exit from a market is better than losing market share and risking penalties in the process.
Similarly, Pakistan could never see the emergence of any serious MNC in the wholesale and retail space, largely because of the inability of MNCs to maintain multiple books of accounts to manage smuggling or goods trading in the informal economy. Local players can manage a profitable suite of formal and smuggled products, while MNCs would not be able to compete with such a product mix. In such an environment, where one is simply not able to compete because of a lopsided taxation environment, the market holds little promise for any serious growth.
A pertinent metric of the prevalence of an informal economy is the ratio of Private Sector Business Deposits to Government Deposits, because a government will always have to use banking channels for its transactions, but private sector businesses can avoid formal channels. The ratio clearly demonstrates a significant drop, as the deposit growth of private sector businesses continued to lag behind government deposits, with most businesses preferring to operate in the grey, or as individuals to avoid taxation.

PRICE FIXING
The government has an obsession with fixing prices, a practice that has historically never worked, with thousands of years of economic history clearly demonstrating that the wisdom of policymakers cannot catch up to the invisible hand of the market. The government, and its different tentacles, has a habit of fixing prices, whether for medicine, electricity, gas, or something as mundane as milk or jalebis.
An economic environment where prices can be arbitrarily fixed leads to inefficient allocation of resources and does not allow businesses to compete in a fair environment. Fixing prices when costs increase results in losses for the producer, who then has to decide whether to continue with the business or completely change strategy.
The drop-off-a-cliff of the pharmaceutical industry, and its eventual plateauing, clearly demonstrates the same. Pharmaceutical production over the last three years has flat-lined and is much lower than in the years before that, even though the population continues to grow.
It can be seen in the production of tablets, syrups, capsules, injections and every other product. The demand continues to be there, but production has dropped as manufacturers moved towards a trading-oriented model. This is a classic case of shooting oneself in the foot: we destroy productive capacity through arbitrary pricing mechanisms and delayed drug approvals — and then we wonder why every pharmaceutical entity is packing up shop.

THE TAX ARBITRAGE
To keep it simple: if operating formally, an entity has to navigate the labyrinth of the tax code and incur additional compliance costs in managing it, while also having to increase the price of its final product. Meanwhile, if that product is competing with a product that can be smuggled or produced while evading taxes, the formally and honestly operating entity becomes uncompetitive, as its product is priced higher than others, resulting in erosion of market share.
 

Custom officials inspect smuggled goods seized during an operation at the Torkham border at Landi Kotal in 2024: Pakistan could never see the emergence of any serious MNC in the wholesale and retail space, largely because of the inability of MNCs to maintain multiple books of accounts to manage smuggling or goods trading in the informal economy | Pakistan Press International

An entity operating formally and complying with all regulatory requirements is actually priced out of the market. In such a scenario, there is no room for any sustainable growth, and companies eventually have to decide whether to operate formally and continue bleeding, or move towards the dark side.
 


HOW DO WE FIX THIS?
There is no magic bullet or magic pill. The road to reform is rocky and does not require an incessant number of conferences that do not solve any problem. It requires the will to solve the underlying economic problem, and that is a distortionary taxation and chaotic investment regime. The taxation structure needs to be fixed such that domestic investment is incentivised and risk-taking is rewarded rather than penalised.
This requires a significant reduction in corporate taxes and all other incidentals, whether that is super tax or other charges. It also requires a transition from the informal economy to the formal economy, and that can only happen with a massive reduction in currency in circulation and lower tax rates across the board. It is economically inefficient to operate formally in this economy; this is what needs to change.
The groupie behaviour to court foreign investors also needs to evolve. Solve problems for domestic investors first and foreign capital will follow. Capital follows risk-adjusted returns — it will gravitate towards whatever jurisdiction can provide more sustainable returns. The government should not be doing micro-interventions. It should be creating an enabling environment for competition to emerge and for attracting efficiency-seeking foreign direct investment. If we are being pushed to provide guaranteed returns for foreign capital, the battle is already lost at that point.
The government needs to step back from its obsessive-compulsive urge to set an arbitrary price for everything and creating unintended consequences in the process. Create an enabling environment and let the market operate. Creating an enabling environment is a long-drawn, boring process that cannot yield quick wins that can be celebrated with a half-page newspaper ad. This is where institutional development needs to happen, such that the enabling environment can sustain itself.
Savings need to be mobilised through formal financial infrastructure and reallocation of the same into non-productive areas needs to be penalised. It is easier to buy smuggled gold in Pakistan than to open a bank account or be part of the formal financial infrastructure — this is what needs to change.
None of the problems can be solved without solving for mobilisation of savings and redirecting the same towards productive enterprise. This is an economic problem and it needs to be addressed through economic tools rather than brute force, which never works on a long enough timeline.
The exodus of MNCs from Pakistan cannot be attributed to one specific issue but to a spectrum of issues that need to be addressed individually and as part of an economic reforms agenda. The first step in this journey is to accept that the wisdom of markets is far superior to the wisdom of policymakers. The sooner we accept this, the sooner we can start the reform journey.

The plan was to hold a protest rally there in support of the Palestinian people. 
Ironically, TLP had more or less remained quiet when Israeli forces were pounding Gaza with bombs. So, understandably, the government of Pakistan questioned the real intention behind TLP’s sudden impulse. After all, the Palestinian Islamist outfit Hamas has been rather forthcoming in accepting some major conditions penned in Trump’s plan. And also, though reluctantly, the far-right Zionist regime in Israel agreed to suspend its hostilities in Gaza. At least for now. 
So what was TLP up to? Its cadres and leadership clashed with the police and damaged public property in their bid to reach the US embassy. Maybe it was a case of late awakening. But here’s the thing: TLP is not a ‘natural’ fit when it comes to issues such as the decades-old Israel-Palestine conflict. 
 
 

For years, the issue was only rarely viewed as a ‘religious conflict.’ It was (and still is) a fight for land. In the first half of the 20th century, the Zionist groups that were most active in this regard were largely secular and many even held left-wing views. 

Sectarian outfits in Pakistan, such as the TLP, remain outsiders to the ideological lineage of the Palestinian struggle they claim to defend

These groups were challenged by Palestinian Arabs driven by a nationalism that was an offshoot of Arab nationalism. Arab nationalism evolved from a 19th century intellectual and political movement called the Nahda. Nahda sought to challenge European colonialism and a weakening Ottoman Empire by moulding the Arabs into a modern, progressive and culturally united national whole. It was further evolved by Muslim, as well Christian, Arab intellectuals, mainly in Palestine, Syria, Egypt and Iraq. 
It is from various Arab nationalist movements that most anti-Zionist Arab organisations first emerged. Until at least the early 1980s, their resolve was rooted in Arab unity and anti-Zionism. Their ideological spectrum ran from far-left to left to centre-left. Therefore, progressive outfits that supported the Palestinian cause in non-Arab Muslim-majority countries became natural fits to the cause. For example, the first government of the left-leaning Pakistan Peoples Party (1971-77) facilitated left-wing Palestinian groups to open their offices in Pakistan and receive funding. The PPP became a natural fit for the Palestinian cause. 
However, from the early 1980s, the secular Palestinian groups started to face resistance from outfits that evolved from the Islamist organisation the Muslim Brotherhood (MB). The groups also faced resistance from militant Shiite organisations that were inspired by the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. 
MB was formed in Egypt in the 1920s. But it fell afoul of the Arab nationalist regimes that emerged from the 1950s onwards. The regimes repressed the MB and saw it as a reactionary movement. This is when Saudi Arabia began to host and fund the MB. Saudi Arabia bolstered the MB and its offshoots because it saw the secular Palestinian organisations as tools of the Soviet Union and a threat to Arab monarchies. The idea was to strengthen the Islamist groups so that they could weaken the secular/leftist outfits that were dominating the struggle against Israel. The Saudi monarchy wanted the ‘anti-communist’ Islamists to usurp the Palestinian struggle. 
Interestingly, there is now enough evidence to also claim that the Israeli state also began to show interest in Islamist groups in this regard. In October 2023, the Israeli journalist Tal Schneider wrote that, in the 1970s, “Israel permitted the growth of Islamist activity in Gaza.” Israel helped expand a charity run by one Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. By the late 1970s, the charity had evolved into a political movement. Israel viewed this movement as a non-threatening alternative to the militant secular Palestinian groups. The movement’s hostility towards the secular Palestinian forces was encouraged by Israel. 
Yassin was highly influenced by the MB and, in 1987, his movement turned into a militant-political organisation — Hamas. Hamas began to aggressively co-opt Palestinian nationalism by adding a stark Islamist dimension to it. Consequently, the narrative that viewed the struggle as a religious conflict began to gain strength. What’s more, eventually, this narrative was also adopted by the far-right Zionists. 
 


So, political groups in non-Arab Muslim countries that have roots in or were influenced by the MB and its offshoots also became natural fits to the Palestinian cause. The mainstream Islamist party in Pakistan, the Jamat-i-Islami (JI), is an example. The MB and its many offshoots are inherently Sunni and adhere to what came to be referred to as ‘political Islam’ and/or ‘Islamism’. Islamism draws inspiration from Islamic symbols, traditions and values to pursue socio-political objectives. It largely emerged in the early 20th century. 
Like the JI, most other Islamist parties in South Asia also borrow heavily from Islamism but, unlike the JI, they are not natural fits for the Palestinian cause. For example, Islamist groups that represent South Asian Sunni strands, such as the Barelvi and the Deobandi, have no traction in the Arab world. In fact, ‘Barelvi Islam’ (a kind of folk Islam in South Asia) is frowned upon by most Arabs. And this is the strand that the TLP represents. The TLP is theologically at loggerheads with ‘Arabist Islam’ and is opposed to the Shiites. 
Political Shiite movements that gave birth to organisations such as Amal and Hezbollah became linked to the Palestinian cause because they emerged in Israel’s neighbour, Lebanon, and many Shiite Arabs were once part of various left-wing anti-Zionist organisations. 
The TLP, a radical-populist expression of Barelvi Islam in Pakistan, can only have a rather superficial association with the Palestinian cause because, historically, the cause was once dominated by secular and left-wing Muslim forces, and then by Islamist groups shaped by the political Islam of the MB and of pro-Iran Shiite groups. 
The TLP, on the other hand, was shaped by South Asian sectarian and sub-sectarian fissures, and not by political Islam as such. And neither can militant Sunni groups such as the Taliban claim any natural link to the Palestinian cause because the Taliban’s version of Islam is rooted in the South Asian expression of Sunni Deobandi radicalism. Neither have any political or social roots in the Arab world and certainly none in Arab nationalism.

According to officials familiar with the development, the PTI may be unable to field its candidates in the polls since the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has yet to allot it a symbol — a prerequisite for participation under the new Local Government Act.
The officials said under the recently enacted law, any candidate elected as an independent councillor must join a political party within 30 days of assuming office. However, with PTI lacking formal registration and a symbol, independents supportive of the party will neither be able to affiliate themselves with it nor face disciplinary action from its leadership if they act against party lines.
The PTI’s intra-party election dispute has been pending before the ECP for the past 19 months. Legal experts said PTI’s lawyers have shown little urgency in resolving the matter, resulting in prolonged delays. The ECP has also suspended proceedings owing to a stay order issued by the Lahore High Court, effectively stalling the case.
Meanwhile, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan said the new Local Government Act, 2025, was still awaiting his signature.

Uncertainty prevails as governor is yet to assent to bill

Speaking at a reception, the governor remarked that he would decide on the bill after receiving a detailed briefing.
“I have yet to fully understand the new law,” he said. “The secretary for local government will brief me on Monday (tomorrow), and only then I will take a final decision.”
The Punjab Assembly had passed the new local government bill last Monday as the ECP began delimitation process under the PLGA 2022 to hold elections for local bodies in December, rejecting all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new law.
Observers say that with legal ambiguities unresolved and the local government framework awaiting gubernatorial assent, the timeline and political complexion of Punjab’s local elections remain uncertain — with PTI’s participation hanging in the balance.

Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn that 37-year-old Sabir Baber was riding a motorcycle when a water bowser (KJF-6195) hit him at Liaquatabad-10 in the limits of Sharifabad police station. He sustained critical injuries and was transported to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
The incident angered area people who set the heavy vehicle on fire, after which it was completely destroyed, said Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan. He added that it was a private company’s bowser. The driver responsible for the incident escaped from the spot. The mob also damaged a trailer (TMP-156), said a traffic police official.
In another incident, a motorcyclist was killed while two others were injured when a heavy vehicle hit them on M.M. Alam Road near Malir Cantonment.
Model Colony SHO Shaukat Awan told Dawn that three persons were riding the bike when the six-wheeler loaded trailer hit them. As a result, they sustained critical injuries and were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where one of them was declared dead.
The officer claimed that he was present at Model Mor when the incident occurred. He rushed to the spot and controlled the situation. The errant driver was arrested. The identity of the deceased could not be ascertained immediately.

• Pulses stay costly despite global drop
• Poultry prices fall amid overproduction
KARACHI: The price of tomatoes has surged, with rates reaching as high as Rs560 per kilogram in retail markets.
Wholesalers, however, claim that retailers are charging more than double the wholesale price, which currently stands between Rs250-300 per kg. The inflated prices have left many consumers buying smaller quantities, often just 250 grams, to meet their immediate needs.
Haji Shahjehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway, attributed the high prices to a shortage of tomatoes in the wholesale market. He cited the declining Balochistan crop, which is nearing its end, and the thin arrival of tomatoes from Iran as key factors. The situation has been further exacerbated by the tense border conditions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, making tomato shipments from Afghanistan unlikely. New supplies from Sindh are expected to arrive next month.
Shahjehan added that the absence of price lists in markets allows retailers to set prices at their discretion, leading to substantial markups. Prices of other vegetables, including peas, ridge gourd, and ginger, have also risen, with some items seeing a price increase of Rs50-100 per kg.
Poultry prices decline
While vegetable prices are spiralling, consumers have seen some relief in poultry prices. The national average price of live poultry has dropped to Rs300-390 per kg, down from Rs440-540 per kg in Septem­ber. Similarly, the price of boneless chicken has fallen from Rs1,000-1,100 per kg to Rs650-800 per kg.
Kamal Akhtar Siddiqui, Sindh Poultry Wholesalers Association General Secretary explained that the drop in prices was due to overproduction at poultry farms. With shipments of live birds and eggs to Afghanistan suspended because of border closures, farmers have been forced to release overgrown birds into the market at lower prices. In some areas, live chickens are being sold for as low as Rs400 per kg, while chicken leg pieces are priced around Rs350 per kg. However, eggs have remained expensive, with prices between Rs310-360 per dozen, driven by high demand following the reopening of schools.
Pulses stay costly
In the pulses sector, wholesale prices have largely remained stable despite a decline in international prices. Masoor, mung, mash, and gram pulses continue to sell at Rs250-300, Rs320-500, Rs380-530, and Rs250-380 per kg, respectively, since September. Rauf Ibrahim, President of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association, noted that global prices for several pulses, including black gram, arhar, and masoor, had fallen sharply. However, these reductions have not been passed on to consumers at the retail level. Ibrahim emphasised the government’s responsibility to ensure that lower wholesale prices reach the public.
The international price of pulses has seen a noticeable drop, with black gram falling from $650 to $460 per tonne, arhar from $1,000 to $500 per tonne, and masoor from $660 to $460 per tonne. The price of Kabuli Channa has also fallen from $750-800 to $650 per tonne. Ibrahim anticipates that additional shipments of pulses from countries such as Burma, Australia, and Tanzania could further reduce prices next month.
Sugar concerns
Sugar prices in Pakistan have remained steady, with rates ranging from Rs177-200 per kg despite concerns raised by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA). On October 14, 2025, the PSMA discussed the ongoing issue with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) over the suspension of sugar sales through the S-Track Portal. PSMA officials warned that continued disruption to the portal could lead to a sugar shortage, which would drive prices up.
The association claims that the FBR’s actions are aimed at facilitating the sale of imported sugar while hindering the sale of domestic sugar. PSMA representatives argue that this could destabilise the market and increase prices, leaving the industry unable to shoulder the blame for rising costs.
Volatility impact on consumers
The Karachi food market continues to experience significant price volatility, which has left many consumers struggling to adjust to the shifting cost of everyday items. Retailers have faced criticism for overcharging, with no clear pricing guidelines in place to regulate the market. Wholesale prices, though, have seen a general downward trend in some sectors.

• Republican leaders criticise the events as ‘Hate America’ rallies; US president offers muted response, says ‘I’m not a king’
WASHINGTON: Huge crowds took to the streets Saturday in all 50 US states to vent their anger over President Donald Trump’s hardline policies at “No Kings” protests that top Republicans ridiculed as “Hate America” rallies.
From New York and Washington to smaller cities in Michigan, more than 2,700 protests were planned coast to coast, with organisers saying they expected millions to attend what could be one of the largest protest turnouts in modern US history.
The mass mobilisation, the second of its kind after similar events in June, is aimed at what opponents say is an agenda pushing the country toward autocracy.
“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands at a protest in Washington near the National Mall. Many carried American flags while others shouted, “Hey hey ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”
Demonstrators are up in arms over what they see as strongarm tactics since the Republican billionaire returned to the White House in January. Grievances include attacks on the media, the prosecution of political opponents and a vast immigration crackdown that has seen National Guard troops ordered into cities such as Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis.
The protests also come as a US government shutdown entered its third week, with the Trump administration firing thousands of federal workers amid a legislative impasse.
Thousands flooded New York’s Times Square, Boston Common and Chicago’s Grant Park. In Los Angeles, where organisers said they expected 100,000 people to attend, plans were made to float a giant balloon of Trump depicted in a diaper.
“I never thought I would live to see the death of my country as a democracy,” Colleen Hoffman, a 69-year-old retiree, told AFP in New York. “We are in a crisis — the cruelty of this regime, the authoritarianism. I just feel like I cannot sit home and do nothing.”
While Trump’s response to Saturday’s events was muted, his top surrogates were in more fighting form. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the day of protest the “Hate America rally”. 
“You’re going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,” Johnson told reporters. 
Republican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the “Hate America” phrase and referred to participants as the “terrorist wing” of the Democratic Party. 
Other Republicans have voiced concerns that the marches could motivate political violence, especially following the September assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk, a close confidant of Trump. 
In an interview with the Fox News show “Sunday Morning Futures”, Trump addressed the “No Kings” moniker directly. “They’re saying they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” he said. 
The movement’s organisers, a coalition of more than 300 grassroots groups led by the progressive organisation Indivisible Project, framed the day as a defence of democratic principles. 
“There is nothing more American than saying we don’t have kings and exercising our right to peacefully protest,” said Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible. 
Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said protesters wanted to convey that “we are a country of equals.” The ACLU said it had given legal and de-escalation training to tens of thousands of people acting as marshals at the marches. 
Support for the demonstrations came from top Democrats, including Sen Chuck Schumer, Sen Bernie Sanders and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
“I say to my fellow Americans this No Kings Day: Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence,” Schumer wrote Saturday on X. “Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.”



 
Beyond the United States, small protests took place Saturday in London, Madrid, Malaga, Spain and Malmo, Sweden. 
Dana Fisher, a professor at American University and an author of several books on American activism, said the day’s main point was to build solidarity. 
“The main point of this day of action is to create a sense of collective identity amongst all the people who are feeling like they are being persecuted or are anxious due to the Trump administration and its policies,” Fisher said.  
“It’s not going to change Trump’s policies. But it might embolden elected officials at all levels who are in opposition to Trump."

Globally, 27.6 per cent of jobs held by women are potentially exposed to automation or major changes from generative AI (GenAI), compared to 21.1pc of jobs held by men, the report from the UN Department of Social Affairs (DESA) found.  
These risks stem from structural inequalities, gender biases embedded in technology, and uneven access to digital resources.  
The impact is expected to be felt most acutely in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, where women are concentrated in clerical jobs, education, and public administration — sectors with high exposure to GenAI.  

Urges govts to close digital gender gap by ensuring affordable internet and digital skills training for women

This trend follows a historical pattern. Earlier stages of digitalisation, which focused on automating routine and manual tasks, also disproportionately affected women.



 
Between 2000 and 2019 in the United States, 3.5 million administrative support and assembly-line jobs held by women of prime working age were lost, compared to one million such jobs held by men.
“Job displacement is one of the primary challenges,” the UN report says, noting that while earlier automation affected low-skill tasks, GenAI “is expected to have more wide-ranging effects” by automating tasks across various skill levels.
A critical factor compounding the problem is the under-representation of women in the technology sector itself.  
The report highlights that women’s low participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields can “significantly intensify gender inequalities”. The share of women with skills in STEM remains below one-third across a sample of 73 countries.  
This gap is concerning not only for current employment but also for the future, as AI systems trained on biased datasets risk “perpetuating and amplifying discrimination in hiring processes and other critical decisions”, the report warns.  
While greater diversity in tech teams is not a complete solution, the analysis suggests more diverse teams are better positioned to identify and mitigate the risks of biased technology.  
Despite the significant risks, digitalisation also presents new opportunities for women’s economic inclusion.  
New work models like remote work, teleworking, and the gig economy can help women work around traditional barriers such as rigid schedules and caregiving responsibilities.  
The UN macro-analysis says that by “enabling more flexible and innovative employment options, digitalisation can drive greater economic inclusion and empowerment for women”.



 
In developing countries, many women have benefited from digital platforms and e-commerce, but a persistent digital gender gap continues to exclude many from these opportunities.  
To counter the risks and leverage the opportunities, the UN urges governments to prioritise closing the digital gender divide by expanding affordable internet access, providing digital skills training for women and girls, and promoting women’s employment and leadership in the tech sector.

District Judge Phyllis Hamilton ruled on Friday that NSO Group’s behaviour fell short of a “particularly egregious” standard needed to support the jury’s calculations on a financial penalty.
But in the ruling, she said the court “concluded that defendants’ conduct causes irreparable harm, and there being no dispute that the conduct is ongoing” the judge granted WhatsApp owner Meta an injunction to stop NSO Group’s snooping tactics at the messaging service.
“We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting civil society members,” WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart said in a statement.
Evidence at trial showed that NSO Group reverse-engineered WhatsApp code to stealthily install spyware targeting users, according to the ruling.
The spyware was repeatedly redesigned to escape detection and bypass security fixes at WhatsApp, the court concluded.
The lawsuit, filed in late 2019, accused NSO Group of cyberespionage targeting journalists, lawyers, human rights activists and others using the encrypted messaging service.
Hamilton ruled however that the $168m damages verdict awarded to Meta earlier this year was excessive.
“There have simply not yet been enough cases involving unlawful electronic surveillance in the smartphone era for the court to be able to conclude that defendants’ conduct was ‘particularly egregious’,” Hamilton wrote in the ruling.

• Red Zone area briefly opened to repatriate Afghan refugees
QUETTA: Calm prevailed on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border on Saturday after the extension of a ceasefire between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces, with no untoward incident reported from any area of the Chaman sector, where heavy clashes had erupted in the early hours of Tuesday last week.
 
 

Although the border crossings at Chaman and other entry points have closed for the past six days, Pakistan partially reopened the border in the Red Zone area to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Afghan refugees.
“Under tight security, several hundred Afghan refugee families, including women and children, along with their belongings crossed into the Afghanistan over the past three days, a senior official said.
The border was opened for three days, while it remained closed for the other three due to intense fighting at four locations in the Chaman sector,” he added.
Following the ceasefire, no firing or attack was reported from either side. “Forces equipped with heavy weapons remain on high alert to respond to any situation,” the official said. The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border remains intact on the Pakistani side, while the Afghan Taliban damaged the gate on their side.
The Inspector General of Fron­t­ier Corps (North) Balochistan re­­c­e­ntly visited the Chaman border, where he was briefed by senior Frontier Corps commanders on the situation following the armed cla­shes. He also visited Pakistani border posts and the Friendship Gate.
The border, however, remains completely closed for all other purposes — including Afghan transit trade, imports, exports, and cross-border business — for the past six days.
Hundreds of loaded trucks and trailers carrying Afghan transit goods, fresh fruits, vegetables, and other commodities have been stranded on both sides of the border. “Around 140 trucks loaded with grapes and pomegranates are waiting in the Vesh Mandi area of Afghanistan to transport consignments to Quetta and other Pakistani cities,” officials said.
Similarly, over 500 loaded trucks carrying Afghan transit goods and import-export items have been stranded on the Pakistani side of the border in Chaman since the clashes began.
The business community engaged in cross-border trade has reported heavy financial losses, as perishable goods — particularly fruits and vegetables — are spoiling due to the prolonged closure.
Traders’ organisations, including the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed serious concern over the situation and urged authorities to reopen the border to prevent further economic losses.

• Justice Arbab Tahir to hear petition along with office’s objections on Monday
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has raised objections to a petition filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala jail.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir is scheduled to hear the petition, along with the registrar office’s objections, on Monday.
The petition was submitted by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal through Advocate Ali Bukhari on behalf of the provincial chief minister. The petition argued that a meeting with the PTI founder was essential to discuss matters pertaining to provincial governance and the formation of a new cabinet.
However, the IHC registrar’s office objected to the maintainability of the plea, noting that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
The move came after CM Afridi was denied a meeting with PTI founder at Adiala jail. Following the refusal, the KP government approached the IHC, naming the federal and Punjab interior secretaries, the inspector general of Punjab Police, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
 
 

According to the petition, the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow the meeting, but no approval was granted. The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Advocate General Shah Faisal, who verified his biometrics at the IHC under a special power of attorney, told reporters that CM Afridi had personally attempted to meet the PTI founder but was denied access despite having sought the prime minister’s permission. He added that the chief minister also intended to raise the matter before the Chief Justice of Pakistan on the administrative side and might approach the Supreme Court if necessary.
PTI leader and counsel Ali Bukhari said the ban on political meetings, imposed on November 26 last year, was contrary to the Pakistan Prisons Rules and violated visitation rights. He argued that even court directions regarding such rights were being disregarded, asserting that “meetings with inmates are a right, not a privilege.”
The petition requested the court to direct the jail authorities to immediately allow a meeting between the KP chief minister and the PTI founder, and to issue guidelines for future consultations as part of routine governance communication. The IHC will take up the petition, along with objections, for hearing on Monday.

• Says govt ‘close to deciding’ fate of Roosevelt Hotel
• Backs global financial reforms to ease climate burden
• Briefs World Bank president on govt’s flood response
WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Saturday that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot impose any conditions on Pakistan that go against the country’s national interests.
Speaking at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, the minister said that all the reforms undertaken so far under IMF programmes were consistent with Pakistan’s own economic priorities and had contributed to improving the national economy.
“Please name any IMF-suggested reform that is not aligned with our national interest,” he asked in response to a question.
Mr Aurangzeb announced that the IMF is expected to release the $1.2 billion tranche pledged under last week’s staff-level agreement by Dec 31.
“The Fund’s executive board will soon meet to review the agreement, and the amount will be released shortly thereafter,” he added.
At the conclusion of his six-day visit to Washington, the minister also expressed optimism about finalising a trade and tariff agreement with the United States “within a week or two”.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb, who attended 65 meetings during the World Bank Group’s annual autumn session, said the government was also “close to deciding” the fate of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, a property owned by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Seven international consortia, including Citigroup, have submitted bids to advise Pakistan on the privatisation of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York — a century-old Manhattan landmark considered one of the country’s most valuable foreign assets.
According to media reports, Islamabad is pursuing a joint venture model rather than an outright sale, seeking a redevelopment partner to maximise the property’s long-term value as part of a privatisation effort agreed under its $7bn IMF programme.
Pakistan backs V20 agenda
Separately, Pakistan joined 68 other nations on Saturday in calling for reforms to the global financial system to help vulnerable economies cope with the mounting impacts of climate change.
The appeal was made at a meeting of the Vulnerable 20 (V20) — a coalition of finance ministers from 68 countries most exposed to climate risks — held on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings in Washington.
 






The group seeks fairer access to climate finance and changes in global lending rules to support adaptation and recovery efforts.
“Pakistan strongly supports the V20 agenda to reform the global financial architecture, ensuring that climate finance is more accessible and affordable,” Mr Aurangzeb said while addressing the meeting.
He emphasised the need to align climate financing with the requirements of vulnerable economies to “ensure resilient growth”.
Ranked first on the Climate Risk Index 2025 despite contributing less than 0.9 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan continues to bear disproportionate losses.
Experts warn that the country now requires $40-50bn annually to effectively mitigate and adapt to climate risks.
Mr Aurangzeb informed the V20 gathering that the government was pursuing its own reforms to align national policies with the group’s call for equitable climate finance. These efforts include developing creditworthy project pipelines, issuing green bonds and creating carbon market mechanisms to attract investment, he added.
Flood response
In a related development, the finance minister met World Bank President Ajay Banga in Washington on Friday and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts. This meeting also took place on the sidelines of the plenary sessions of the IMF and World Bank, which Mr Aurangzeb attended during his six-day visit to Washington from Oct 13 to 18.
An official statement said Mr Aurangzeb briefed Mr Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the bank’s timely support following the post-flood damage assessment.
The minister also endorsed the proposal to leverage technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience,” the statement read.
The minister requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach to reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency.
The minister highlighted Pakistan’s Climate Prosperity Plan, which aims to shift the country from vulnerability to resilience and from risk to investment.
Separately, in a meeting with Turkiye’s Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Simsek, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted Islamabad’s ongoing reform efforts in key sectors, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatisation, and public finance.

• Taliban regime seeks confirmed coordinates of TTP hideouts; pledge to address concern
• FO says govt to press Afghan Taliban to honour commitments
• Tarar rebukes ICC over ‘biased, premature’ comment on ‘airstrike deaths’
ISLAMABAD: Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan were held on Saturday amid cautious optimism on both sides for de-escalation following a week of deadly cross-border clashes, though a breakthrough remained uncertain in the absence of concrete Taliban commitments on ending terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil.
The meeting, held in a cordial atmosphere, continued well into the night behind closed doors in Doha.
Participants of the Doha dialogue reportedly kept shifting their stance on the continuation of talks. Initially, both sides considered adjourning the negotiations for a week, but later agreed to reconvene on Sunday.
However, the latest word from sources familiar with the closely guarded proceedings suggested that the discussions, held in deep secrecy, continued late into the night, with a joint communique expected to be issued.
The talks were opened by a senior Qatari intelligence official before the Pakistani and Afghan delegations began direct discussions on outstanding issues.
The Pakistani side was led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, accompanied by National Security Adviser and ISI Chief Lt Gen Asim Malik. The Afghan side was represented by Acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid and Inte­lligence Chief Maulvi Abdul Haq Wasiq.
According to diplomatic sources, Pakistan pressed that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Afghan soil was “not acceptable” and urged verifiable action against the group.
The Taliban delegation, while signalling willingness to cooperate, reportedly asked Pakistan to provide verified details of TTP hideouts and promised to address the concerns “to Pakistan’s satisfaction”.
However, Taliban representatives also cautioned that it was “unrealistic” to expect Kabul to entirely stop TTP operations inside Pakistan.
 
 

Afghan negotiators further complained that Pakistan’s public narrative had negatively impacted the Taliban’s international recognition prospects and alleged that militants of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) captured in Afghanistan had claimed to have received training in Pakistan.
Taliban negotiators, during the course of the meeting, kept consulting their leadership in Afghanistan, according to a source.
In a statement issued earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the high-level delegation would “urge the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities”, including the Fitna Al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna Al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army).
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been high for the past two years over what Islamabad calls Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border terrorism. The situation escalated sharply on Oct 9 when Pakistan launched airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan, and reportedly sent fighter jets over Kabul after which explosions were heard.
The Taliban then launched attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11 in which at least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred. Pakistan’s counter-response left about 200 Taliban fighters dead, according to security officials.
The two sides afterwards agreed on a 48-hour ceasefire and to hold dialogue during that break. The ceasefire was later extended.
Friday night’s cross-border exchange, in which Pakistani forces targeted Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group positions across the border, briefly threatened to derail the Doha dialogue. However, both sides decided to proceed with the talks as planned.
 
 

The Afghan government spokesperson claimed that Pakistan had conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan hours after the ceasefire was extended on Friday for as long as the talks continued.
He claimed that the attacks targeted civilians. Afghanistan withdrew from the Twenty20 international tri-series in Pakistan next month following the alleged death of three local cricketers that the Afghanistan Cricket Board claimed were due to military strikes in Paktika.
Govt rebukes ICC
However, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistan has targeted verified camps of the “Khawarij-affiliated” Gul Bahadur group in the border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.
In a post on X, the minister stated that during a 48-hour ceasefire, militants affiliated with the group and operating from Afghanistan attempted multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. He said all such attempts were effectively thwarted by the security forces. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan, he said.
In a later post, the minister said that Pakistan rejected the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) “selective, biased and premature comment that advances a disputed allegation, as established, that three ‘Afghan cricketers’ died in an ‘airstrike’. The ICC has cited no independent verification to substantiate these claims.”
“Pakistan strongly rejects the characterisation and contests the ICC’s claim and call for immediate correction,” he added. “Pakistan has consistently held that politics must not contaminate the sport, especially cricket, and urges the ICC to uphold its independence and the spirit of the game… Pakistan expects the ICC, led by its current Chair (Jay Shah), who happens to belong to India, to restore its neutrality, international standards of fair play and unbiased conduct.”
Amid the ongoing discussions, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim spoke separately with both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Afghan Prime Minister Muhammad Hasan Akhund, offering Malaysia’s assistance in mediating the conflict.

• Relief stalled as Israel insists Rafah crossing to stay shut until Hamas returns remains of all prisoners
• Nine members of a family killed when Israeli forces fired at bus
JERUSALEM: The United Nations aid chief on Saturday took stock of the monumental task of restoring dignity and hygiene for Palestinians struggling to survive amid Gaza’s devastation, as he witnessed residents digging latrines among the ruins, while Israel and Hamas exchanged more bodies.
A convoy of white UN jeeps carried relief coordinator Tom Fletcher and his team through the twisted rubble of shattered homes to see a wastewater treatment plant in Sheikh Radwan, north of Gaza City.
“I drove through here seven to eight months ago when most of these buildings were still standing and, to see the devastation — this is a vast part of the city, just a wasteland — and it’s absolutely devastating to see,” he told AFP.
The densely populated cities of the Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, have largely been reduced to ruins by two years of bombardment and intense fighting between Hamas and the Israeli army.
Digging latrines
Surveying the damaged pumping equ­i­pment and a grim lake of sewage at the Sheikh Radwan wastewater plant, Fle­t­cher said the task ahead for the UN and aid agencies was a “massive, massive job”.
The British diplomat said he had met residents returning to destroyed homes trying to dig latrines in the ruins.
“They’re telling me most of all they want dignity,” he said.
“We’ve got to get the power back on so we can start to get the sanitation system back in place. Fletcher outlined an ambitious relief plan. “We have a massive 60-day plan now to surge in food, get a million meals out there a day, start to rebuild the health sector, bring in tents for the winter, get hundreds of thousands of kids back into school.”
Bodies exchange and Rafah crossing
Meanwhile, Hamas has returned the final 20 surviving prisoners it was holding and has begun to hand over the remains of another 28 who died.
On Saturday, in line with the terms of the ceasefire deal, Israel returned the bodies of 15 more Palestinians to Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said.
As aid trickles in, the situation surrounding the Rafah border crossing remains disputed.
On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the crossing would remain closed until Hamas hands over the bodies of all deceased prisoners still held in Gaza.
This contradicted an earlier announcement by the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo that the crossing would reopen on Monday. Israeli authorities, who had multiple times over the past few days delayed the border’s opening, said that when the crossing does reopen, it will permit only the movement of people, not aid.
The Gaza health ministry said that some of the bodies returned on Saturday bore signs of “abuse, beatings, handcuffing and blindfolding”.
Nine family members killed
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed nine members of a single Palestinian family when they shelled a bus on Friday, after the military confirmed it had targeted a vehicle that crossed the so-called “yellow line”.
“Our teams recovered the bodies of nine martyrs, including four children and two women, after Israeli occupation forces directly targeted the vehicle they were travelling in,” Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the Gaza Civil Defence agency, said in a statement to AFP on Saturday.
Bassal said Israeli forces fired “two tank shells at the vehicle,” and noted that the bodies of two children remained missing, as their “remains were scattered due to the intensity of the bombardment”.
He said recovering the rem­­­­­ains has been particularly challenging because of the “difficult field and environmental conditions” in the area.

• Sets protocol on allegations, places limits on foreign invites
• Reviews 74 complaints; 70 closed, three to proceed
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday approved far-reaching amendments to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges, barring them from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar, while Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
 
 

Under a substituted Article V, judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
Judges are not to interact with the media, especially on issues liable to spark public debate or undermine institutional collegiality and discipline.
Where allegations are made public against a judge, the matter may be placed in writing before a committee comprising the CJP and four senior Supreme Court judges, through the registrar, for an institutional response. Judges may not publicly discuss judicial or administrative matters, nor disclose communications relating to personal or official affairs.
The council, acting on a decision first taken on July 12, deliberated on amendments proposed by the CJP. With some modifications, these were approved by the majority and ordered to be notified in the official gazette, circulated to all superior court judges and posted on the Supreme Court’s website.
The previous 2009 code had required judges to avoid publicity and political controversy, but did not contain the new media-interaction bar or response mechanism.
 
 

A new Article XII directs judges to abstain from presiding over or attending social, cultural and diplomatic functions.
Article XIII treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct; any such invitations received personally must be routed via the relevant chief justice. Article XIV bars judges from accepting dinners or receptions hosted in their honour by individual members of the bar.
Article XV says that judges must decide cases on merit alone, possess the moral integrity and intellectual capacity to resist internal or external influence, and, where legal powers are lacking, seek an immediate institutional response.
Judges must promptly inform, in writing, the CJP and the four most senior Supreme Court judges (via the registrar) of any such attempts; high court judges must also inform their respective chief justices.
High court chief justices are to place such reports before a three-judge committee within two days, with a decision due within a fortnight.
Matters sent for judicial determination are to be decided as early as possible by adhering to the principles of fair trial and due process. If a high court chief justice or committee fails to act within time, the CJP, with four senior Supreme Court judges, will take up the matter.
The code, originally framed by the SJC in 1962 and amended up to Oct 18, 2025, under Article 209 of the Constitution, is binding on all superior court judges.
Articles I to IV and VI to XI — covering personal conduct, recusals, financial dealings, extra-judicial roles, gifts, collegiality, timely judgements and fidelity to the constitutional oath — remain in place.
SJC on misconduct
Meanwhile, the SJC examined 67 complaints under Article 209 filed by different individuals, of which 65 were unanimously closed, one was deferred, and one was ordered to be processed further by the majority.
The council was later reconstituted under Article 209(3b) with the inclusion of Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah joining, after the Islamabad High Court chief justice expressed an inability to attend for certain agenda items.
The reconstituted council reviewed seven more complaints, closing five unanimously and deciding by majority to proceed further on two.
According to an informed source, the SJC deferred the complaint against Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri until Nov 20 and issued notice to another judge of the Islamabad High Court over allegations of delayed judgement.
After decisions on the 74 complaints taken up at Saturday’s sitting, 87 cases remain pending initial consideration. The SJC has dealt with 155 matters since October 2024.

Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from Kabul today in the Qatari capital Doha, the Foreign Office said today.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister noted that Pakistan has tried to resolve the issue through diplomatic channels and the military’s connections to Afghanistan, but so far these attempts have failed.
“For the first time, a third country is getting involved to convey that Afghanistan has to abide by the Doha agreement, whereby they will not allow the use of their territory for acts of terrorism by anyone,” he said.
“Through a third country, a conversation is ongoing. The only positive way forward is that Afghanistan prohibits the use of its soil to all actors using it to stage acts of terror, as laid out in the Doha agreement.”
When asked if Pakistan would respond to attacks by targeting terrorists on Afghan soil, Chaudhry replied: “Why don’t things improve? It’s because they (Afghans) lack resolve and commitment. Khawarij are trained and sponsored there before they enter Pakistan.”
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
“Now, Afghanistan is shaking hands with India and recognising [occupied] Kashmir as Indian territory. We kept saying ‘they are proxies’ and now they have proven it.”
The state minister said that “proxy forces” need to remember that Pakistan will maintain its stance and do whatever is necessary to defend its people and territorial integrity.
“If terrorism is Pakistan’s internal issue, then why do they [terrorists] come from Afghanistan?” he asked, referring to recent remarks from Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating that terrorism is a country’s internal issue.
“We have identified their camps and hideouts and how they enter Pakistan. We have sent them multiple dossiers with this information, but nothing has been done,” he emphasised.
Since last weekend, Islamabad and Kabul have been engaged in a series of border clashes.
Last Sunday, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement.
Afghanistan claims it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Clashes broke out again earlier this week on Tuesday, with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire was agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities, due to expire at 6pm PKT on Friday. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-18 16:37</small></div><hr>
