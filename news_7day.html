“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft.
“The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added.
 






According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), which is available with Dawn.com, Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match on Wednesday.
The Asia Cup match between the two sides took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May.
Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav stood firm and hit the winning six as Indian fans celebrated at a stadium, which had a lot of empty seats, and the players from both teams went off without handshakes.
After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”.
In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian army.
 






“We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”
The April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam triggered Pakistan-India hostilities in May. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing the attack — a charge Islamabad strongly denies.
After the match, the PCB confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, “registered a protest against the match referees’ behaviour.”
“It was against the sportsman spirit that the Indian team did not shakes hands,” the PCB statement quoted the manager as saying. It alleged that the “match referee had asked the captains not to shake hands at the time of the toss”.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move.
Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports.
“Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.”
 






India had resisted calls to boycott the match between the nations, with its cricket board stating it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.</p><small>2025-09-15 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/151651109d6ef5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942190/imaan-mazari-approaches-ihc-committee-sjc-against-justice-sarfraz-dogar' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari approaches IHC committee, SJC against Justice Sarfraz Dogar</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir on Monday approached an inquiry committee of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar following last week’s altercation between them.
On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
In a post on X today, the lawyer, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, said she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
 






The complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
The complaint requested the IHC inquiry committee to initiate an investigation.
It further pleaded the committee to declare she was “subjected to sexist, discriminatory, hostile, threatening, intimidating and unreasonable behaviour at the hands of the respondent chief justice” and declare that Justice Dogar was “guilty of harassing the complainant and consequently issue appropriate recommendations to the competent authority (i.e. SJC) against the respondent as envisaged under Section 4(4) of the 2010 act”.
It also requested the committee to grant any other relief “deemed fair and reasonable in the circumstances” in her favour.
The complaint said that the judge had engaged in an “unprovoked and unnecessary tirade” against her during last week’s proceedings.
“Even after the incident, the complainant felt insulted, humiliated and degraded as a result of the respondent chief justice’s brazen abuse of authority. The sentiment was shared by the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues who were present in the courtroom and witnessed the exchange. A collective sense of disbelief and anger was expressed at the unprecedented scenes.
“Unfortunately, while the respondent chief justice had earlier made clear to the complainant that he held a personal grudge/bias against her (as reflected in his conduct and remarks in multiple cases fixed before him), his conduct on September 11 crossed all limits of decency,” the complaint said, adding that in an earlier case involving journalist Asad Ali Toor on August 12, “the respondent chief justice had passed inappropriate and personal remarks towards the complainant, including: ‘Why are you so stubborn?’ Journalists and court reporters, along with the complainant’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were witnesses to the same.”
The complaint said last week’s incident was a “part of the broader pattern of intimidation and degrading treatment meted out to the complainant at the hands of the respondent chief justice, in complete abuse of his position of authority. The respondent chief justice has repeatedly, in courtrooms full of litigants, lawyers, court staff and police officials, aggressively (and often in a vulgar manner) asserted his power (which he is meant to exercise as a trust for the people of Pakistan, not to assert his personal fiefdom)”.
It further said that “apart from the fact that this conduct is completely unbecoming of a judge, the complainant was clearly subjected to a hostile, degrading and threatening work environment by the respondent chief justice, in whose court she was required to appear before for her client. The treatment meted out to the complainant was in full public view, and the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues”.
The complaint pointed out to the public condemnation and criticism in the wake of the “sexist, discriminatory and threatening remarks”, referring to the statements from various lawyer associations.
It added that instead of “acknowledging and apologising for his threatening, sexist and intimidating conduct, the respondent chief justice once again made further sexist remarks against the complainant, in her absence, in his courtroom, in an entirely unconnected case, the very next day on Sept 12 … The respondent chief justice continued to abuse his authority/position in once again threatening the complainant in her absence that he would initiate contempt of court proceedings against her, whilst also stating that he did not want to ruin her career and attempting to ridicule her by calling her a ‘child’ in a courtroom full of people, when the complainant is a well-respected lawyer in the community”.
The complaint read that the “sexist comments taken together with repeated threats of ‘contempt of court’ and ‘not wanting to destroy’ the ‘female child’s career’ are not only appalling but shocking coming from someone holding the office of chief justice of a constitutional court, meant to uphold the fundamental rights of all citizens”.
It argued that the judge’s conduct, “apart from being clear misconduct — also falls within the ambit of workplace harassment. Not only did the respondent chief justice make clear his views on women in open court but he also abused his position of authority to harass, intimidate, threaten and humiliate the complainant in a place where she is required to appear every day by virtue of her job/profession as a lawyer”.
It said the chief justice’s conduct fell within the definition of “harassment” in the 2010 act.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct on Sept 11 and 12 constitutes ‘verbal communication’ of a ‘sexually demeaning attitude’ and ‘derogatory’ expression that caused ‘interference with work performance’ and also created ‘an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment’. Further, the sexist, discriminatory and threatening conduct of the respondent chief justice also constitutes ‘discrimination on the basis of gender’ which does not necessarily have to be ‘sexual in nature’ but which ‘may embody a discriminatory and prejudicial mind set or notion, resulting in discriminatory behaviour’,” the complaint argued.
It added that Mazari was “made to feel extremely uncomfortable in her workplace and was at the receiving end of hostile, threatening and sexist language used against her by the respondent chief justice in an open court” in the presence of lawyers, police officials, journalists and litigants.
The complaint said the “power balance” between the two parties was also “evident”.
“The continued abuse of authority by the respondent chief justice has clearly been fuelled by the power imbalance between the parties, which led to his further misogynist statements/remarks on Sept 12, in the absence of the complainant,” it added.
The complaint said the Thursday incident was a “glimpse of the respondent chief justice’s opinions on women, particularly how he views them as possessions of husbands, to be controlled and reigned in when he feels they are overstepping their gender roles.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct is the clearest possible manifestation of a patriarchal mindset, which cannot be tolerated, especially in the superior judiciary which is meant to safeguard citizens’ constitutional rights, including the right to basic human dignity. The conduct of the respondent chief justice on Sept 12 was yet another manifestation of his patriarchal mindset … once again attempting to humiliate and demean her in a professional setting where she is required to appear every day”.
Separately, a district and sessions court summoned Mazari and her husband on Wednesday in connection to a case registered against them on the charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media. The challan of the case was presented in court before Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah today.</p><small>2025-09-15 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/151446457c3b1b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942178/pakistan-again-holds-interest-rate-at-11pc-as-floods-stoke-inflation-fears' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan again holds interest rate at 11pc as floods stoke inflation fears</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate steady at 11 per cent on Monday for a third straight meeting as policymakers weighed inflation risks from flood-hit crops against a fragile economic recovery.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000 basis points (bps) from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, the central bank has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community had expressed disappointment over the decision.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting today,” an SBP statement said.
The MPC noted that inflation remained “relatively moderate in both July and August, whereas core inflation continued to decline at a slower pace”.
“Economic activity — as captured by high-frequency economic indicators, including large-scale manufacturing (LSM) — gained further momentum. However, the near-term macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated slightly in the wake of the ongoing floods,” the committee noted.
 
 

It cautioned: “This temporary yet significant flood-induced supply shock, particularly to the crop sector, may push up headline inflation and the current account deficit from earlier expectation in FY26.”
Meanwhile, it added, economic growth was projected to moderate compared to the previous assessment.
“In view of the evolving macroeconomic outlook and the flood-related uncertainty, the MPC deemed today’s decision as appropriate to maintain price stability.”
Floods in the country, which have caused losses estimated at billions of rupees due to crop and land damage, have added pressure to inflation, particularly in agriculture-based products. There has been a significant price increase for items such as rice and vegetables.
Business stakeholders have expressed divergent views on the impact of floods on supply chains, with some citing delays in interprovincial cargo movement and crop damage, while others insisted supplies of food, fuel, and medicines remain normal.
However, the committee observed that the “economy is on a significantly stronger footing to withstand the negative fallout of the ongoing floods” compared to previous major flood events.
“Given the low inflation environment, moderately growing domestic demand and relatively benign global commodity price outlook, the excessive inflationary and external account pressures witnessed after the previous floods are projected to remain in check this time.
“Furthermore, the build-up in external and fiscal buffers over the past two years, which was achieved via a coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix, will need to continue to make the economy more resilient to shocks and ensure higher growth on a sustainable basis.”
The statement also said that since the last MPC meeting, SBP’s forex reserves
remained stable, despite net debt repayments and a current account deficit; inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses inched up in September in the sentiment surveys jointly conducted by the SBP and the Institute of Business Administration; tax collection by the Federal Bureau of Reserves “fell slightly short of target” during July-August 2025, though it “grew significantly” on a year-on-year basis; and the announcement of revised import tariffs by the US has led to some reduction in global trade uncertainty.
“In view of these developments and outlook, the MPC assessed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the medium-term target range of five to seven per cent, notwithstanding some expected short-term volatility in inflation out turns.”
The statement further said that inflation in the country rose 4.1pc year-on-year in July before falling to 3pc in August.
“These out turns largely reflected volatility in food and energy prices, whereas core inflation remained on downward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace.”
The MPC noted that the recent floods had increased uncertainty related to the near-term inflation outlook, particularly for food inflation, adding that weekly sensitive price index data had already recorded a “substantial increase” in prices of perishables, wheat and allied products.
Meanwhile, after dropping below the 155,000-point mark on Friday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) saw signs of recovery today as it regained that level.
Ahead of today’s meeting, the PSX gained 1,138.1 points at 10:24am to reach 155,577.78.
Shares dropped as low as 154,486.21 points at around 1pm, before closing at 155,384.50, gaining 944.82 points (0.61pc) compared to the previous session in the wake of the MPC announcement.
 

This screengrab from PSX’s data portal shows the PSX activity on Sept 15, 2025.

Last month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb noted that there was a “room” for lowering the policy rate by the end of this year, but stressed that it was the purview of the SBP and its MPC.
A recent survey conducted by the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute revealed that 92pc of respondents expected the interest rate to remain unchanged, despite trade and industry groups calling for further cuts to stimulate economic activity.
The MPC had kept the rate steady at its last meeting in July, citing potential inflation risks from rising energy prices and geopolitical tensions, even though inflation had been moderating.</p><small>2025-09-15 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15164410c8d0e0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942168/lack-of-sportsmanship-reactions-pour-in-after-india-refuse-to-shake-hands-with-pakistan-in-asia-cup' target='_blank'><strong>‘Lack of sportsmanship’: Reactions pour in after India refuse to shake hands with Pakistan in Asia Cup</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of India, who beat them by seven wickets after beating the paltry 128-run target set by the Green Shirts.
However, the match had been marred by controversy from the beginning due to calls from across the border to “boycott” the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands with their rivals at the toss and after the match.
 
 

Furthermore, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was said to have “politicised” the win by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his nation.
From cricketers and politicians to fans and analysts watching the game, social media was rife with their takes on the scene.
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X shortly after the match.
“Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace,” he wrote.
 






He later said that the PCB has also lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket” and sought his removal from the Asia Cup.
Former Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez simply wrote on X: “sportsmanship”, followed by a broken heart emoji.
 






Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, during a show aired on tapmad platform, said, “Do not make this match political, it’s a cricket match.”
“Do a handshake. I said this pre-match too, that shake hands; there is no issue in it. It’s a game of cricket. Show your grace.”
Akhtar lamented how the Indian cricketers took matters to the “next level”, adding, “I would go and shake hands with my enemies.”
The cricket legend further said he did not like the “post-match ceremony”, apparently referring to Suryakumar’s comments, and that Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha made the right move by skipping the ceremony in response.

Meanwhile, Pakistan pacer Aamir Jamal stated that when it comes to sportsmanship, “India will always lack [in] these things”.
Citing Suryakumar’s remarks about his not shaking hands being in alignment with the Indian government and its cricket board to “give a proper reply”, Jamal said: “That’s not a reply, it’s [a] game of cricket.”
 






Defence Minister Khawaja Asif lamented how India had brought “cricket to this level”.
“Loss of face and international humiliation suffered by India in the recent conflict cannot be compensated by such shabby and petty attempts,” Asif wrote.
“Wounds inflicted by [Pakistan] armed forces, loss of IAF (Indian Air Force) planes, including mighty [Rafales] won’t heal by such cheap theatrics,” he said, referring to Pakistani forces downing six Indian jets during the May conflict.
 






“India’s injection of politics into sports is shameful,” wrote PTI leader and ex-senator Faisal Javed Khan on X, as he criticised state-broadcaster PTV for purportedly airing Suryakumar’s “anti-Pakistan remarks”.
Dr Khurram Abbas, director of the India Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, recalled that Yadav was “trolled in India” after he shook hands with Salman at the trophy reveal ceremony.
“Now under pressure and perhaps [on] instructions by the BCCI, Team India refused to shake hands with team Pakistan at the time of [the] toss and at the end of the match, which is against sportsman spirit,” he wrote.
“This game is getting politicised … ICC should intervene.”

Leaders from around 50 states are expected to attend the high-level moot. which is being held under the umbrella of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
PM Shehbaz is accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, according to PTV News.
He was received by Qatar’s minister for culture, Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Hamad Al Thani .
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar is already in Doha and actively participated in a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution that will be discussed during today’s summit, which has been co-sponsored by Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz has also undertook a one-day visit to Doha on September 11, when he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli attack and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
Today’s summit has been convened to rally support for Qatar following the Israeli attack targeting Hamas leaders in the Gulf state on September 9. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed in the attack. The attack — widely condemned by major world powers — was carried out while negotiations were underway for a ceasefire in Gaza, in which Qatar has been playing an instrumental role.
 
 

The summit will also discuss the “escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians“, according to an earlier Foreign Office (FO) statement.
Analysts say the high-level moot is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Tel Aviv’s attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the UAE and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
According to a Dawn report, diplomats said leaders at the summit may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
 
 

Moreover, the United Nations Human Rights Council said today that it would host an urgent debate on Tuesday on Israel’s airstrike in Qatar.
The council said the debate would “discuss the recent military aggression carried out by the State of Israel against the State of Qatar on 9 September 2025’”.
Apart from PM Shehbaz, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraqi PM Mohammed Shia al-Sudani will also attend today’s moot in Qatar. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also expected to participate, Turkish media reported.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas also arrived in Doha on Sunday, on the eve of the summit.
Pezeshkian today urged Muslim countries to cut ties with Israel. “It is possible that Islamic countries cut their ties with this fake regime and maintain unity and cohesion as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said before departing for Doha, adding that he hoped the summit would “reach a conclusion” on measures against Israel.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry has also confirmed the attendance of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the moot.
“Upon the directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, HRH the Crown Prince departs for Qatar to head the Kingdom’s delegation participating in the extraordinary session of the GCC Supreme Council and the Arab-Islamic emergency summit in Doha,” ministry posted on X.
 






US President Donald Trump, who had dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York on Friday, made careful remarks before today’s Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies face a worsening rift.
“Qatar has been a very great ally. Israel and everyone else, we have to be careful. When we attack people, we have to be careful,” Trump told reporters.
 


The US president initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
Rubio is set to meet with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today to examine the aftermath of Tel Aviv’s military action against Qatar and its effects on efforts for a Gaza truce.
Dar seeks steps against Israel to safeguard global order
Foreign Minister Dar met with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan today. The two leaders “strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified strikes on Qatar and other nations in the region”, the FO said on X.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, underlined the importance of the OIC and the Arab League in mobilising collective action of the Muslim Ummah, and welcomed the convening of the Arab-Islamic Summit.”
 






Dar yesterday also met with OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s FM Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan, Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain and Uzbekistan’s FM Bakhtiyor Saidov.
Attending the ministerial meeting, the foreign minister called for urgent steps against Israel to “safeguard the global order”.
During his speech, Dar highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to a FO statement.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
The foreign minister listed the following “urgent steps” that need to be taken:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.

India and the US will “fast-track” trade talks, Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator and a special secretary in its commerce ministry, told reporters at an event for the release of trade data, but gave no details.
“US Trade Representative for South Asia Brendan Lynch is set to make a one-day visit to New Delhi on Tuesday,” Agarwal said.
India’s exports slowed to $35.10 billion in August from $37.24bn in July, and its trade gap narrowed to $26.49bn, from $27.35bn in July.
The US imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil starting August 27, taking the total on Indian exports to 50 per cent, among the highest for any US trading partner.
Exports to the United States fell to $6.86bn in August from $8.01bn in July. New Delhi’s shipments to Washington in the period from April to August stood at $40.39bn.

A few months ago, AJK police initiated a strike with an 11-point charter of demands. These include increases in medical allowance, conveyance allowance, house rent, and the implementation of a career progression system similar to that of Punjab police. Additionally, there are demands for improved retirement policies, training, housing, and educational facilities for the children of police personnel.
In July, AJK police observed a pen-down strike and subsequently organised a state-wide strike to demand better rights and facilities in major districts.
The manpower for law enforcement in AJK should consider the police protests and strikes in the region. Moreover, the government suspects that the AJK police may extend their protests and strikes, potentially expressing further resentment.
Sources within the interior ministry told Dawn that a few days ago, in a meeting, the heads of five departments and forces, including Islamabad Police, FC, and FIA, were instructed to mobilise forces for deployment in AJK, particularly at key, sensitive, and significant installations.
They have also arranged the equipment resources currently used by the forces for deployment in AJK.
The department heads were urged to assemble the forces promptly and prepare to respond positively. They requested time to organise the necessary manpower and equipment.
They were instructed to expedite the process; however, they will have three days to reach AJK once the deployment order is issued.
The sources revealed that 4,000 personnel from the capital police and FC were asked. In response, the capital police agreed to provide a force of 2,000 officers, and the FC and FIA also committed to arranging manpower.
Subsequently, in line with their commitments to the interior ministry, the capital police are preparing to deploy 2,000 personnel to AJK.
A letter issued by the office of the AIG Establishment on Saturday, addressed to the DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic, requested a “provision of strength”. It stated that, according to the directions of the IGP Islamabad, the specified police personnel must be sent to AJK temporarily.
DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic were asked to submit their lists of suitable police officers and officials on Saturday to ensure the timely departure of the force to AJK.

“On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat on the “reported presence of khwarij”.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added.
The ISPR added that another IBO was carried out in Bannu, where 17 more terrorists were killed in a gun battle.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored khwariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.
On Saturday, the ISPR said the military had killed 45 terrorists between September 10 and 13 and 19 soldiers were martyred during these operations in KP.
Following those developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to continue responding to terrorism in the country with “full force”.
He said terrorists and their facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan were operating from the Afghan soil with the backing of India.
“The Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan,” he added.
PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-15 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15130553bcfad51.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942160/trump-vows-national-emergency-in-washington-dc-over-ice-dispute' target='_blank'><strong>Trump vows national emergency in Washington DC over ICE dispute</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he would call a national emergency and federalise Washington DC after Mayor Muriel Bowser said its police would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the United States illegally. Trump’s threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city.
The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump’s August deployment of National Guard troops to “re-establish law, order, and public safety“, after calling crime a blight on the capital.
“In just a few weeks. The ‘place’ is absolutely booming … for the first time in decades, virtually no crime,” Trump said on Truth Social.
 


Bowser’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s post.
Earlier, he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of ICE, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end.
Trump blamed “radical left Democrats” for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, “crime would come roaring back”.
He added: “To the people and businesses of Washington DC, don’t worry, I am with you and won’t allow this to happen. I’ll call a National Emergency, and federalise, if necessary!!!”
Bowser, who has previously praised Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement.
The National Guard serves as a militia answering to the governors of the 50 states, except when called into federal service. The DC National Guard reports directly to the president.</p><small>2025-09-15 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15124022a684fa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942152/indian-forces-gun-down-top-maoist-rebel-two-others' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces gun down top Maoist rebel, two others</strong></a><br><p>Indian security forces killed a top Maoist commander and two other rebels in a gun battle on Monday, officials said, as the government intensifies efforts to crush the decades-long conflict.
India is waging an all-out offensive against the last remaining traces of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement began nearly six decades ago.
More than 12,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed since a handful of villagers rose up against their feudal lords there in 1967.
The latest gun battle took place early on Monday in the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said in a statement. The federal police described the operation as a “major breakthrough”.
Three “top Naxal commanders” were killed in the fight, the CRPF said, including Sahdev Soren, who was part of the central committee of the Maoist organisation. Authorities had issued a bounty of around $113,000 for his capture.
Last week, forces killed another Maoist commander and nine others in a fierce gun battle along the forested border between the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
The Indian government has vowed to crush the rebellion by the end of March next year.
The rebellion controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters at its peak in the mid-2000s. A crackdown by Indian troops across the “Red Corridor” has killed more than 400 rebels since last year, according to government data.
The group’s chief, Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, was gunned down in May, along with 26 other guerrillas.
The conflict has also seen several deadly attacks on government forces. A roadside bomb killed at least nine Indian troops in January.</p><small>2025-09-15 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1422563790700b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941744/pak-vs-ind-india-make-short-work-of-uninspiring-pakistan-win-by-7-wickets' target='_blank'><strong>Pak vs Ind: India make short work of uninspiring Pakistan, win by 7 wickets</strong></a><br><p>India romped to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory in their high-intensity encounter against Pakistan in the men’s Asia Cup 2025 in Dubai on Sunday.
The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgham terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
“We stand with the victim’s families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity, and we want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces,” the Indian skipper said.
Speaking at the post-match press conference, Yadav said: “Our government and the BCCI were aligned. We took a call and came here just to play the game and gave them (Pakistan) a proper reply.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha was not present at the post-match ceremony.
 






Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason the Pakistani captain was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
 


The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, “registered a protest against the Indian team’s inappropriate behaviour.”
“Manager Cheema has also registered a formal protest against the match referee’s behaviour as well for requesting the captains not to shake hands during the toss,” the PCB said.
Earlier, it was a clinical performance by the Men in Blue after the Indian spinners ruled the roost in the first innings and Pakistan stumbled to 127-9 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
 
 

The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-18 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons throughout the match.
Left-arm wrist spinner Yadav came into the attack and struck twice on successive balls to dismiss Hasan Nawaz and Mohammad Nawaz as Pakistan slipped to 64-6 before the 13 over mark.
Yadav was named player of the match for the second successive time in the tournament.
Wickets kept tumbling, but Shaheen coming in at eight down took all the Indian bowlers to the cleaners with four mighty sixes in his unbeaten 33 off 16 balls to push the total past 120.
Pakistan play UAE next on Wednesday and despite the defeat to India are expected to make the next stage and face India again next Sunday.
India, with two wins from two, are nearly through to the next Super Fours stage of the tournament with their final group match against Oman on Friday.

Over 15 — Ind - 123-3
Yadav looking to finish things off quickly as he lifts Saim for four. Dube ends the over with a massive six and it looks likely Saim will finish as Pakistan’s most successful bowler with figures of 3-35 off four overs. India need five more to win.

Over 14 — Ind - 110-3
13.4: The Indian skipper Yadav cuts Nawaz for four in a statement of authority!
Frustration for Pakistan on the second ball as Yadav flashes, but the ball falls short of point and goes for four. The India skipper adds to the misery by cutting Nawaz for four past the same fielder two balls later. Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Over 13 — Ind - 100-3
The man with the golden arm strikes again!
Saim has knocked over Verma with one that gripped and spun.
 


Shivam Dube walks in. India need 28 runs more off the last seven overs as their hundred comes up.

Where’s a miracle when you need one?
 



Mid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim:
Pakistan need a miracle. India are coasting in the chase, there is no run-rate pressure, and Pakistan are having difficulty in exerting spells of sustained pressure. The Green Shirts need quick wickets if they are to have any chance.

Over 10 — Ind - 88-2
9.1: Verma launches Sufyan for six!
Sufyan brought in as Salman tried to stymie India with spin, but Yadav lifted him over fine leg for four — his first boundary. Pakistan need a breakthrough and needed it yesterday!

Three singles off the over as Abrar keeps Verma quiet.

Over 8 — Ind - 71-2
Sufyan brought in as Salman tried to stymie India with spin, but Yadav lifted him over fine leg for four — his first boundary. Pakistan need a breakthrough, and quick.

Over 7 — Ind - 64-2

Over 6 — Ind - 61-2
Verma welcomed Nawaz with a reverse sweep for four and then got another on the third ball.
India is eating into Pakistan’s total. Required rate dips below five as the powerplay ends with Men in Blue at 61.

Over 5 — Ind - 48-2
Abrar has a loud shout for lbw against Yadav turned down. India failed to get a boundary in the over, just six runs coming off it.

Over 4 — Ind - 42-2
3.4: Saim has struck again!
Just when Abhishek Sharma looked like becoming a thorn in Pakistan’s ambitions of getting wickets and stopping the run flow, Saim struck. It was a case of one too many for the left-handed. Having hit back-to-back fours off Saim, he went for another and was caught at long-off.
 


Tilak Verma now at the crease. Only eight runs off the over. Saim looks keen to turn it around for Pakistan with the ball.

Over 3 — Ind - 33-1
Sharma v Shaheen again, and the Indian opener gets a four first-ball, slashing a wider delivery, and before hitting a monstrous six two balls later.
 


Suryakumar Yadav makes a quiet start. He comes into this match with a patchy record against Pakistan.

Over 2 — Ind - 22-1
Saim Ayub is into the attack; let’s hope he can emulate what the Indian spinners did in the first innings.
1.6: Saim has struck with his carrom ball yet again!
Pakistan is attacking with spin from the get-go, with Saim bowling the second over. Shubman Gill hits him for consecutive fours, but it’s one too many as he is stumped off the last ball. Pakistan have the wicket they wanted!

Over 1 — Ind - 12-0
0.1: Newbie Abhishek Sharma welcomes Shaheen Afridi with a boundary off the very first ball of the over.
India get off to a flier. Sharma smashed the first ball back past Shaheen for four and deposited the second ball for six over long-off.

Mid-match summary by Abyan Amir: The Indian spinners ruled the roost as Pakistan stumbled past 120 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-19 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons in the first innings.
The Green Shirts have something to defend on board, courtesy of four sixes by Shaheen to end the innings.
India will have to contend with Pakistan’s spin trio of Abrar, Sufyan and Nawaz
Will this be an Afridi cameo to remember, or will India gallop home easily? Only time will tell!
 







Over 20 — Pak - 127-9
Huge six by Shaheen off Pandya over long-on!
The next one is even bigger! It’s in the second tier as Pandya can only scratch his head.

Pakistan have something to defend.
Over 19 — Pak - 110-8
Hundred up for Pakistan!
Sufyan got back-to-back fours off Bumrah to start the over — the first a punch down the ground and the second an upper-cut. Bumrah got back by cleaning up his stumps on the last ball. Pakistan are nine runs away from 120.

Over 18 — Pak - 99-8
17.2: Shaheen smacks another six over long-off off Chakravarthy!
Pakistan suffered another blow when Faheem fell lbw two deliveries later. Shaheen keeps strike for the next over.

Over 17 — Pak - 90-7
16.1: Final hope Sahibzada’s attempt to accelerate brings about his downfall, hitting Kuldeep down Panya’s throat, after a patchy 44-ball 40.
16.3: Shaheen smacks Yadav for a huge six over wide long-on!
55 dot-balls in the Pakistan innings so far
With three overs to go, Pakistan risk falling short of even a run-a-ball total!

Over 16 — Pak - 83-6
Five runs off the over as India keep things tight. Pakistan need to push on with just four overs left

Over 15 — Pak - 78-6
14.3 Calls of shot in the newsroom as Pakistan’s only hope at the moment, Sahibzada pulls Yadav for a single.
Faheem finished the over with a four, but runs continue to be hard to come by for Pakistan.

Over 14 — Pak - 72-6
Umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge’s day is going as badly as the Pakistani batters.
He’s given two howlers, both were missing the stumps by miles.
Sahibzada saw a lbw decision overturned on review and finished the over with a four.
 



Over 13 — Pak - 64-6
12.4: Hassan Nawaz departs cheaply!
12.5: Mohammad Nawaz is gone first ball!
India will probably feel they can bowl Pakistan out in quick time. Kuldeep has once again tormented Pakistan. Two wickets in two balls — first Hasan Nawaz caught and then Mohammad Nawaz lbw. Sahibzada has been in from the start and now has all-rounder Faheem Ashraf for support. They are Pakistan’s last recognised batting pair.

Over 12 — Pak - 62-4
Sahibzada broke the shackles and launched the first ball down the ground for six. But two dot balls followed before Pakistan got two more singles. Runs are coming slowly for Pakistan.
 



Over 11 — Pak - 54-4
Singles off the first four balls in Abhishek Sharma’s first over, another off the last ball.
50 up for Pakistan in the 11th over of the innings.

Mid-innings analysis: In the four overs after the powerplay, Pakistan have only got seven runs whilst losing two wickets.
If Fakhar’s departure wasn’t enough, Salman never got going and in an attempt to get quick runs, fell to Patel, who now has two wickets.
Pakistan have to hit out of the spin trap if they are to post a match-saving total. Up to Hasan Nawaz to provide the impetus.

Over 10 — Pak - 49-4
Patel back into the attack as Salman cuts him.
It gets worse for Pakistan. Skipper Salman is caught in the deep.
Salman tried to hit out of the pressure, and only succeeded in getting a top edge off Patel. Pakistan are struggling.

Over 9 — Pak - 47-3
8.2: Salman was adjudged lbw second ball off the over as Chakravarthy changed ends, but Pakistan breathed a huge sigh of relief when it was overturned on review.
Chakravarthy continued bowling a nagging line to Salman with just two runs coming off the over.
Over 8 — Pak - 45-3
7.4: Fakhar is gone!
Axar Patel was brought on into the attack and got the big wicket of Fakhar Zaman off the fourth ball he bowled. Fakhar tried to hit him out of the park, but could only find Tilak Verma running in from long-on.
The onus is now on captain Salman Ali Agha to stabilise the innings.

Over 7 — Pak - 43-2
Only two runs off the over as India’s left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav comes into the attack. Pakistan have to start accelerating.

Over 6 — Pak - 42-2

Got two runs after a miscue on the very next ball. Pakistan will be thankful they are just two down at the end of the powerplay, especially after the start they got off to.

Over 5 — Pak - 34-2
India brings on their first spinner — Varun Chakravarthy
4.3: Fakhar slots Chakravarthy for four down the ground

Over 4 — Pak - 26-2
3.3: Sahibzada smacks Bumrah over wide long-on for a six!
Pakistan’s first six of the innings comes in the 4th over. The early inning jitters are now gone.
 


Another good over with no losses as Sahibzada and Fakhar look to rebuild Pakistan’s innings. Bumrah bowled two good balls to open the over before Sahibzada smashed him for six over long-on. Those were the the only runs in the over but crucially, Pakistan have not lost another wicket.

Over 3 — Pak - 20-2
Pandya is pulled away for a single by Fakhar.
2.3: Pakistan get their first boundary courtesy a pull by Fakhar.
Good over for Pakistan. Two singles came off the first two balls before Fakhar pulled a short one from Pandya for four — Pakistan’s first boundary. Fakhar got another with a drive through the legside off the fifth ball while three runs came from wides.

Over 2 — Pak - 7-2
1.2: Haris gets a top edge and Bumrah strikes. Pandya catches, running in from fine leg.
Pakistan have got off to the worst possible start. India have their tails up. Haris was the standout in the side’s tournament-opener against Oman but now he departs.
 


1.4: It gets worse for Pakistan. Fakhar has been adjudged lbw. The left-hander immediately reviewed
Pakistan get a reprieve, the review shows ball pitching outside leg.
Bumrah bowls a splendid first over with some searing yorkers. Gets the dangerman Haris and also had Fakhar, only for it to be overturned on review.

Over 1 - Pak 5-1
India’s Hardik Pandya starts off with a wide down the legside.
Saim Ayub falls on the very first ball of the match.
Saim Ayub’s troubles with the bat continue. He was also out first ball against Oman.

Haris flashes and misses on the next ball. He blocks the penultimate ball off the over.
He hits out on the next ball and gets two.

Anthems
The Pakistani national anthem is being played first at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
 


The Indian anthem is being played next.
Pakistan openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan make their way to the crease.

Analysis by Dawn’s Umaid Wasim: Pakistan wanted to bat first and set an above-par total. India wanted to bowl first. Both sides will be quite happy with the outcome of the toss. Pakistan, though, face a trial by spin. The pitch is the same as the one for India’s opening match against the UAE. India skipper Suyakumar Yadav said at the toss that batting got easier in the second stanza of the UAE game, and perhaps that is why he wanted his side to be batting second.

An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “We’re very excited for the match.”
According to the captain, Pakistan’s rationale behind batting first is that the surface looks to be on the slower side.
His Indian counterpart, Suryakumar Yadav, said this team was really looking forward to this game.
Both teams are unchanged since their last encounters in the tournament.
Pakistan batter Saim Ayub said on Saturday that the team was not just focusing on the Pakistan-India match, but winning the men’s Asia Cup.
 


While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
The two teams last faced each other in February, in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the ODI format.

The blueprint seeking to build “an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era” comes against the backdrop of a shifting regional and global security and economic landscape, with Beijing — in the words of a Chinese foreign ministry official — “envisioning an even greater role for Islamabad in international and regional affairs”.
China has pledged its support to help Islamabad achieve that goal, the official stated recently speaking to a delegation of Pakistani journalists visiting Beijing.
The new roadmap draws mainly on earlier milestones, including the launch of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative in 2015, and subsequent documents and pledges like the long-term CPEC plan and the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation.

In spite of a lot of optimism around the new China-Pakistan roadmap, many remain cautious as ‘an element of uncertainty still hangs’ over CPEC cooperation

It looks to expanding security ties, including stronger military cooperation and enhanced counter-terrorism coordination. Both sides described their strategic defence partnership as “irreplaceable” for regional stability, reiterating “zero tolerance” on terrorism. More importantly, while security ties remain central, both sides are consolidating economic cooperation.
The plan in question reaffirms CPEC as the “flagship” of their economic partnership and a pioneering project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), aligning its five corridors — growth, livelihoods, innovation, green and openness — with the growth goals of Islamabad’s Uraan initiative, with a focus on tighter security for Chinese nationals and projects in Pakistan amid targeted terrorist attacks against Chinese interests.
The roadmap for bilateral cooperation under what Pakistani officials often refer to as CPEC 2.0 follows Pakistan’s efforts to secure Beijing’s renewed support for its industrialisation through investment in the country’s manufacturing sector to accelerate export-led growth.
So far, energy and transport projects worth $25.2 billion have been completed under the first phase of CPEC, while schemes amounting to $26.8bn are in the pipeline.
The new five-year plan prioritises fast-tracked industrialisation in Pakistan through special economic zones, strengthening of mining and agricultural cooperation, and expansion of “small and beautiful” livelihood projects in health, education, agriculture and disaster prevention.
 
 

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal recently told a media briefing that Pakistan and China had agreed to form a consortium of bilateral and multilateral partners, including the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to finance the $7bn Karachi-Peshawar railway line.
Trade and connectivity will be bolstered through expanded use of the Khunjerab Pass for both bilateral and Afghan transit trade, while pushing forward trade liberalisation under Phase-II of their Free Trade Agreement. Besides, Beijing will encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in Pakistan while committing to providing “financial support (to Islamabad) within its capacity”.
In an interview with Associate Press of Pakistan, Professor Cheng Xizhong, a senior research fellow at Beijing’s Charhar Institute noted that the plan carries extraordinary economic significance as it will strengthen bilateral trade, investment and industrial cooperation.
With CPEC already delivering substantial outcomes, he maintained, the next phase will see greater investment, helping Pakistan boost its development capacity through industrial up-gradation and enhanced position in the global industrial chain.
In spite of a lot of optimism around the new roadmap redefining bilateral ties, many remain cautious. Speaking with Dawn, economist Adil Nakhuda noted that despite the optimism surrounding the action plan, “an element of uncertainty still hangs” over CPEC cooperation. “Security remains the foremost challenge while Pakistan’s fragile economic conditions are discouraging for Chinese investors.”
He points out that the first phase of CPEC, largely focused on energy and transport infrastructure, successfully addressed critical connectivity and growth bottlenecks. “The second phase, however, is supposed to drive industrialisation, FDI inflows and export growth. If exports don’t grow, the second phase will not be any different from the first one,” he cautioned.
For Pakistan to attract meaningful foreign investment, Mr Nakhuda said, it must first tackle security concerns, complete Special Economic Zones and carry out governance reforms. “You have to do this for foreign investors; don’t expect them to bring their capital here and also clean up your policy and governance mess for you,” he underlined, pointing to the need for ease of doing business, tariff rationalisation, factory law reforms, and a broader enabling policy framework. “We need a total policy overhaul for the success of CPEC 2.0.”
Others like Dr Safdar Ali Sohail, Executive Director at the Social Protection Resource Centre and a former civil servant, argued that “CPEC is now just one of several pillars of bilateral China-Pakistan cooperation, with military, security, political and diplomatic ties appearing to take precedence.”
Dr Sohail pointed out that linking economic cooperation with Pakistan’s Uraan programme reflects Chinese sensitivity to Islamabad’s growth priorities. For it to succeed, the plan must be backed in the next six months by targeted and definitive policies, strategies and funding commitments.

Where do Gulf states go from here?</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s recent strike in Doha crossed a line Gulf leaders had long assumed was sacrosanct: that Gulf capitals were under the American security umbrella and hence outside the operational zone of the Gaza conflict .
Not anymore. Gulf states are now grappling with a new reality: a risk-acceptant Israel willing to reorder the wider Middle East — even at the expense of US allies in the Gulf.
For Gulf leaders, the American inability to restrain Israel is perplexing. More fundamentally, a question looms: can they still trust the US security umbrella in a fracturing region?
Some allies more important than others
As a shocked Qatari leadership processed the strike, it looked to Washington and its Gulf partners for support. The US, meanwhile, issued only a mild rebuke of Israel for hitting another close ally that hosts the region’s largest US base, Al Udeid, home to CENTCOM’s regional headquarters. President Trump promised deeper defence cooperation with Qatar and claimed Doha was given last-minute notice of the strike. Qatar pushed back, terming the notification too late. Trump’s remarks dragged Doha into politically uncharted waters, forcing it to reassert its credibility as a reliable mediator.
 


For Qatar, the image of the country as a diplomatic mediator has become the lynchpin of its foreign policy in recent years. Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha struck at the very core of that strategy, shattering the perception of Qatar as a safe and neutral venue for dialogue between belligerents.
For Doha, its role as a trusted broker — backed by US support — has been central to expanding its diplomatic relevance with major powers and securing credibility in international forums. This mediation brand is not symbolic; it is Qatar’s primary tool for offsetting its geographic vulnerability and amplifying its influence in a region where it is dominated by larger neighbours such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Yet, now Qatar is looking up to these very regional neighbours to chart a regional response to Israeli aggression.
Realising the gravity of the moment, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, the regional heavyweights, moved swiftly, framing the strikes as a challenge to ‘collective Gulf security’, not just Qatari sovereignty. This aligns with Article 2 of the ‘Joint Defence Agreement’ of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which states: “any attack on any of them is an attack on all of them and any threat to one of them is a threat to all of them”.
The real dilemma now is: how to treat an Israeli strike on Qatar as an attack on GCC states, without jeopardising their security cooperation with the US, which was meant to protect them in the first place? An uncomfortable truth is now evident for Gulf states: for the US, some allies matter more than others.
What next for the GCC?
At this point, expressions of solidarity and condemnation are simply not enough. Israel will not be deterred by statements alone, knowing Riyadh and Abu Dhabi remain constrained by their dependence on the US security architecture. Despite their show of support, recent history of Qatar’s tense ties with both the UAE and KSA also weighs on the collective response.
 
 

For now, Israel’s reckless behaviour of even attacking those regional neighbours who are facilitating mediation to end the war is hurting the decades-long US security pact with the Gulf states. Among the GCC states, Washington had found a pragmatic partner in Doha, and that collaboration had delivered results in recent years. However, due to Israel’s unhinged risk-taking, both the GCC and the US are now scrambling to restore the credibility of their security cooperation.
The challenge is most acute for Qatar, which must simultaneously restore its security and its standing as a mediator. Within days, Doha moved from mediator to victim.
Drawing on its experience of mediating between the US and the Taliban to end the Afghan conflict, Doha had assumed that Tel Aviv would not strike the very mediator facilitating the only channel linking Hamas, Israel, and Washington.
Qatar’s immediate priority is to raise the reputational cost of any repeat strike while hardening security around negotiations. It is leaning on Washington to restrain Tel Aviv, while underscoring the critical nature of the Doha channel. But trust is absent when Israel appears committed to a military-only path. Beyond mediation, Gulf states, especially Qatar, will now demand firmer guardrails against Israeli aggression and clearer red lines for operations on Gulf soil.
Alternatives to US guarantees do not exist in the short term: Chinese or Russian security patronage is neither feasible nor desirable, and even a regional security architecture involving Egypt, Turkey, or Pakistan cannot function without US assent and participation.
 
 

Crucially, the US umbrella was never designed to deter strikes from Israel — a crucial US ally — on Gulf territory. To adapt, Gulf states must develop defensive capabilities outside the US framework while deepening cooperation with regional partners. Early-warning and missile-defence systems from European and Asian suppliers could provide a ring-fence of protection, creating a semi-autonomous shield.
The Doha strike is more than a breach of sovereignty: it is a stress test for the entire Gulf security order. Outrage without deterrence is noise, and the Gulf cannot afford noise.
The signals from the Gulf must be concrete: tighter airspace control, joint threat alerts, and a quiet understanding that any actor striking inside GCC territory forfeits access to Qatar-hosted mediation.
For Washington, the credibility gap is real. If the US cannot restrain an ally from striking another ally’s capital during US-brokered talks, its security protection is not credible anymore. Finally, as the Gulf ponders a regional diplomatic response to avoid becoming next battle space, Qatar faces its own decisive moment: to host, or not to host?

According to eyewitness accounts, victim Z took cover behind an iron gate as two unidentified motorcyclists allegedly opened fire on him. The victim, however, escaped unharmed and the attackers managed to escape from the scene. The Harappa police registered a case under sections 506 and 34 of the PPC against two unknown suspects, based on Z’s complaint.
Speaking to Dawn, Z said that he was standing near the gate of his house when two young men — estimated to be between 20 and 25 years old — approached on a motorcycle and fired directly at him. “It was dark, and I managed to hide. That’s what saved me,” he said. He claimed that he would be able to identify the attackers if he saw them again.
Local villagers, who witnessed the incident, confirmed hearing multiple gunshots.
The area has a documented history of communal tensions, particularly following the rise of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Notably, Z’s elder brother was also murdered by unknown assailants in a previous incident. At that time, police interrogated individuals affiliated with the Tehreek Tahafuz Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.
ASP Raosen Taj Raisani confirmed his presence at the crime scene shortly after the incident. “We are pursuing two to three leads and hope to trace the suspects soon,” he said.
WHEAT RECOVERED: Around 15,000 metric tons of wheat has been recovered from alleged hoarders during difierent raids conducted over the past three days at 15 warehouses across the Pakpattan and Sahiwal districts.
Pakpattan Deputy Commissioner Asif Raza said that the district administration, special branch and the food department conducted joint operations based on intelligence reports. He said that while some warehouse owners had declared their wheat stocks, most were found to be storing large quantities without disclosure. A total of 9,860 metric tons of wheat had been confiscated in the district.
Separately, Sahiwal Deputy Commissioner Shahid Mahmood confirmed the recovery of 4,285 metric tons of undeclared wheat from a rice mill located at 99/9-L, Sahiwal.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Asif Tufail announced the official retail prices for flour in the Sahiwal division at Rs905 for a 10kg bag and Rs1,810 for a 20 kg bag. The price of roti had been fixed at Rs14, while the wheat support price was set at Rs3,000 per 40kg. The commissioner warned that strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal stockpiling.
Despite these measures, ordinary consumers continue to face rising flour prices following the government’s announcement of the new wheat rates.

• Opposition leader asks KE to withdraw MUCT increase in electricity bills
• Mayor claims City Council approved hike in its budget session
KARACHI: In a move drawing sharp criticism from the opposition for allegedly violating “defined legal limits”, the Karachi Metropolitan Corpor­ation (KMC) has increased the rates of the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) for industrial and commercial users from Rs400 to Rs750.
Members of the business community complained that they were being charged nearly double the previous amount in the head of the MUCT.
The MUCT are collected via K-Electric bills from its consumers living within the jurisdiction of the KMC.
Leader of the Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin of the Jamaat-i-Islami has sent a legal notice to KE Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi, demanding that the power utility immediately withdraw the increase in the MUCT, which was made “unlawfully” without the approval of the elected City Council.
The notice highlighted that the KE raised MUCT rates to Rs750 per month for commercial properties, despite the last City Council resolution, which fixed the rate at Rs400 per month in June 2024. A subsequent proposal to increase the rate to Rs550 was deferred in 2025, and no new resolution has been passed since then, read the notice.
“The KE, which only acts as a collection agent on behalf of the KMC, has no legal authority to alter or enhance MUCT rates,” said Mr Saifuddin.
He said the arbitrary hike not only burdened citizens of Karachi, but also undermined the authority of the elected City Council and insulted the public mandate.
City Mayor Murtaza Wahab, however, expressed his “wonders” over “unawareness” of the opposition and its leaders about the “facts and procedures”.
“This increase has in fact been approved by the City Council in the budget session,” he told Dawn.“So this argument doesn’t stand that it’s a violation of the rules.”
He continued: “Secondly we only increased slab for the industrial and commercial users. The reason is this segment of the city is more prone to fire and other incidents where the municipal resources and utilities are spent more. We should not mislead people only for political point scoring.”
‘No new charges’
KMC officials claimed that no new charges were being imposed under the MUCT head.
“Historically, industrial and commercial consumers were charged up to Rs5,000 under the same category,” said an official.
The slab for industrial and commercial consumers had initially been reduced to Rs400 by the mayor, but it was being revised upward in the latest budget, he added.
“The funds collected through this municipal tax will be utilised for essential services, including the fire brigade and road maintenance,” added the official.
The KMC in August 2024 formally notified the collection of MUCT through K-Electric.
The KMC and the KE had signed an agreement in June 2022 which finally became effective from July 2024 after the City Council approved the levy.
The consumers are charged as per category, which is notified by the KMC from time to time.
Referring to different slabs of the MUCT, an official said that the KE consumers receiving bills of up to 100 units remain exempted from the taxes and those consuming units between 101 and 200 pay Rs20 every month.
Those consuming units between 201 and 300 pay Rs40 and those consuming between 301 and 400 units pay Rs100 through their KE bills.
The KE consumers consuming 401-500 units pay Rs125, the consumers of units between 501 and 600 pay Rs150, the consumers of 601 and 700 units pay Rs175 and those consuming more than 700 units pay Rs300 in their monthly bills.
All categories of commercial and industrial consumers pay Rs400 each with their electricity bills.

• Promises farmers emergency support packages for next sowing season
• Says loss assessment surveys likely to be completed within 15 days
TOBA TEK SINGH: As Pakistan grapples with devastating floods, a senior Inte­rnational Monetary Fund official confirmed an upcoming mission will evaluate if the country’s financial and emergency plans are adequate to handle the crisis, shortly after the finance minister signalled talks with the lender for relief.
An IMF team is expected in Pakistan by the end of the month for a review mission, Federal Minister for Finance and Reve­nue Muhammad Aur­angzeb said on Sunday, stressing that discussing flood-related financial needs with the IMF was a necessary step.
“There is nothing wrong with asking the IMF about the relief, because we are in the fund programme,” Mr Aurangzeb said during a visit to flood-affected areas in Kamalia. “The IMF responded very responsibly and the prime minister announced the relief.”
The minister’s comments came as damage assessments from the catastrophic floods, which have killed at least 972 people, are underway across the nation.
 


“Damage assessments are currently under way, and these are very important — not only for our talks with the IMF but also with other financial organisations,” he said.
While Pakistan plans a comprehensive discussion with the IMF, Aurangzeb noted that the cabinet has decided to first utilise the nation’s own resources to provide immediate aid to the millions affected.
“We have resources available for now. When the IMF team arrives, we will hold a comprehensive discussion with them about what we need at this stage, especially concerning rehabilitation and reconstruction,” he added.
 
 

Key relief measures already announced include a decision that flood victims will not be charged for their August electricity bills, with adjustments made for those who have already paid. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also set a 100-day deadline for the rehabilitation of all flood victims.
The government is also closely monitoring the economic fallout, including inflation. “Since international oil prices are falling, imported inflation is not very high,” Mr Aurangzeb said.
However, he acknowledged a discrepancy between farmers’ reports of severe crop damage and initial government assessments.
He assured that the government would not permit hoarding or price gouging and was considering special packages for farmers to help them sow their next crops on time, adding that farmers and the general public would be facilitated in every possible way so they could resume their livelihoods at the earliest.
He said the government was considering to announce special packages for farmers to enable them to sow their next crops on time.
He pointed out that both a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency had already been declared to protect agricultural productivity and ensure timely rehabilitation of the flood victims
During his visit, Mr Aurangzeb distributed aid to affected families and emphasised the need for better future planning to avoid similar devastation.
“We must learn lessons from past floods and improve planning to avoid such devastation in the future,” he remarked, adding that the location of housing schemes needed serious reconsideration.
IMF to review fiscal agility
Confirming the upcoming mission under the country’s existing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, the IMF’s resident representative in Pakistan, Mahir Binici, said the review would be critical in assessing the country’s financial capacity to respond to the disaster.
“The mission will assess whether the FY26 budget, its spending allocations and emergency provisions remain sufficiently agile to address the spending needs necessitated by the floods,” Binici said in a statement on Saturday.
In May, the IMF’s board approved a $1.4 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities, but the disbursement of funds is contingent on the successful completion of reviews under the EFF.

The president expressed this resolve during a visit to top Chinese aerospace and defence conglomerate, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which manufactures the J-10C aircraft.
According to the President’s Secr­etariat, he is the first foreign head of state to visit the facility. He was accompanied by his children, PPP Chairman Bilawal and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
During the visit, President Zar­dari met with the company’s engineers and scientists and pra­ised the Chinese-made aircraft’s capabilities, which he said were amply demonstrated during the recent Maarka-i-Haq and Opera­tion Bun­yanum Marsoos against India.
 







Head of state gets a peek at stealth fighter production; praises J-10C, JF-17 for strengthening aerial defences

The president lauded AVIC as a “symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the end­uring strategic partnership bet­ween Pakistan and China”.
He was briefed on AVIC’s capabilities, including the J-10, the co-production of the JF-17 Thun­der with Pakistan, the J-20 stea­l­th fifth-generation fighter airc­r­aft, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Paki­stan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Amb­assador to Pakistan Jiang Zaid­ong also accompanied the president.
High-speed train
President Zardari also travelled from Chengdu to Mianyang via high-speed train.
 
 

During the half-hour journey, he praised China’s achievements in developing sustainable transport, calling its pollution-free electric propulsion and earthquake early warning technologies “a marvel of railway engineering”.
He noted that such innovations offered “valuable lessons for other countries including Pak­istan”. Officials highlighted that China operates the world’s largest high-speed rail network of over 45,000 kilometres, carrying more than 2 billion passengers annually on trains that run up to 350km per hour.
With trains running at up to 350km/h, the network links almost all major Chinese cities. China has built a standardised, dedicated passenger system that became a model of modern connectivity, they said.

The 21-year-old Seville crossed the finish line in a 9.77 personal best ahead of Thompson in 9.82 and the USA’s reigning champion Noah Lyles, who won bronze with a season’s best 9.89.
“It was a good run because these two actually pushed me to run a personal best,” Seville, the youngest 100m champion, said at the post-race press conference. He became the third Jamaican sprinter to win this title.
“To come out here and run a 9.77 is something amazing, and in Japan is where I made my debut; to get a medal is something great for me.”
 






Jefferson-Wooden came in as the world lead and left Tokyo with a gold medal, proving her superiority to round off a season unbeaten. Tina Clayton continued Jamaica’s podium finish just minutes earlier when she blasted a 10.76 personal best while Olympic champion Julien Alfred took bronze with 10.84.
“This year has been nothing short of a dream. I’ve been working so hard for this moment to come out here and focus on my execution,” 24-year-old Jefferson-Wooden said. “To put on the perfect race at the perfect time, I’m just so happy and grateful.”
 






For Clayton, a medal wasn’t even a goal coming into her first senior championships.
“The goal was to execute,” Clayton told the press conference with a shyness poles apart from the confidence that won her a medal an hour earlier. “Silver was not in my thoughts, but God did so, and I’m grateful.”
The American women led the country’s gold medal rush as Olympic Champions Tara Davis-Woodhall and Valarie Allman were crowned world champions for the first time in the long jump and discus throw, respectively.
 






The men’s 10,000m also saw a rewriting of the script with two European medalists in a sport long dominated by the Ethiopians and Ugandan Joshua Cheptegi. France’s Jimmy Gressier eclipsed Ethiopia’s Yomif Keljecha in the last 10 metres to win gold, with Sweden’s Andreas Almgren taking bronze.
World championship silver medalist Jakob Ingebrigsten suffered a shock exit in the men’s 1500m heats due to an injury.
“I gave it my best today. It just wasn’t enough. I knew this could happen,” the 24-year-old Norwegian said in a post on Instagram soon after. “But giving up isn’t in my nature. I will be back.”
Much like his run at the Paris Olympics, Ingebrigsten could bounce back in the 5,000m — the heats scheduled on his 25th birthday — and win a third world title in the event.
 






Uruguay won their first medal of the competition and Julia Paternain didn’t even realise it when she crossed the finish line in third.
Earlier in the night in the women’s 100m semi-finals,there was a false start by reigning champion Sha’Carri Richardson. Veteran sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was a shock entrant into the final after a second place finish in her semis.
Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon cruised into the women’s 1500m final (4:00.34) ahead of countrywoman Dorcus Ewoi in 4:00.65. Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu fell in the first 100m of her semi-final but caught up to the pack in a flash and qualified for the final in 4:01.03.

• 48 Palestinians killed
• Netanyahu calls Rubio  ‘extraordinary friend’, says his visit shows strength of US-Israel ties
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces destroyed at least 30 more residential buildings in Gaza City and displaced thousands of residents, according to Palestinian officials, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in the region on Sunday to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At least 48 more Palestinians were killed since Sunday dawn as artillery shelling and gunfire by Israeli forces reported in Gaza City, as well as shelling from boats, according to Al Jazeera.
Israel has already announced its plan to seize the city, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering, and has intensified attacks on what it has called Hamas’ last bastion.
The Israeli army issued a new forced evacuation order for another building in Gaza City.
The military “will attack the building soon” due to the presence of Hamas infrastructure inside or adjacent to it, read a statement on X.
Israeli soldiers have been levelling one by one high-rise buildings in the northern city since starting a major offensive to occupy it.
Two more Palestinians died of malnutrition and starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the territory’s health ministry said on Sunday, raising deaths from such causes to at least 422 people, including 145 children.
Israel blocked all food from entering Gaza for many months, before allowing some aid into the enclave despite the famine declared by the United Nations, which warned that far more was needed.
Thousands of people are estimated to have left Gaza City, but mostly the Palestinians are reluctant to leave, saying there is not enough space or safety in the south, where Israel had asked them to go after designating it as a ‘humanitarian zone’. People say that Israel has repeatedly hit so-called humanitarian zones.
In a post on X, UNRWA says Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City has been “constant” on Sunday, adding that there is “no safe place” in the besieged enclave.
Many Palestinians say they cannot afford to leave while others have pinned hopes on the Doha summit to pressure Israel to scrap its planned offensive.
 






14,000 buildings, shelters destroyed in a month
Hamas said that Israeli forces have destroyed at least 1,600 residential buildings and 13,000 tents since August 11.
In one of the latest strikes, Israeli forces stormed al-Khader Girls Elementary School in Jerusalem’s Old City and assaulted the mayor, Ahmad Salah, the head of the Parents Council, and a municipality member, Issam Naim, the Wafa news agency reports.
 
 

Mahmoud Abdullah, head of the Parents Council at al-Khader Unified Schools, said Israeli forces stormed the elementary school as students were leaving.
Abdullah added that soldiers beat him, Salah and Naim with rifle butts and their hands, causing bruises. He added that the troops threatened to “close all seven schools”.
The school complex has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces who target both female and male students.
At least 64,871 people have been killed and 164,610 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza while millions have been displaced since October 2023.

The countries agreed on the draft framework, which is part of the peace deal, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the draft was now being discussed by stakeholders, including the private sector, multilateral banks, and some donor agencies of other countries.
Congo and Rwanda will likely meet in early October to finalise the framework, the source added. It would be signed by heads of state at a later date. The 17-page framework comes after the countries signed a peace deal in Washington in June at talks held by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deal aims to end fighting that has killed thousands and attract billions of dollars of Western investment to a region rich in tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper, and lithium. The draft builds on an outline for the framework reached in August and sets out implementation measures and coordination mechanisms.
The August outline called for cooperation on energy, infrastructure, mineral supply chains, national parks, and public health.
According to the draft, the parties would pledge to work with the United States and other international partners to develop additional regulatory initiatives and reforms “necessary to de-risk private sector investment in a cost-effective manner,” to reduce illicit trade and increase transparency.
They would also adopt outside transparency mechanisms, including committing to implement guidance from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, among others.
 
 

The draft framework calls for third-party inspections of mine sites and working with private sector partners to develop cross-border special economic zones, according to the draft.
The framework also sets out coordination mechanisms, including timelines for an annual high-level summit on regional economic integration and meetings of a steering committee and technical working groups.
Kinshasa and Kigali, as part of the deal reached in Washington in June, had agreed to launch the regional economic integration framework within 90 days.

The demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group (COG) group had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, adding that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.

C’wealth says report shared with govt, ECP; will be released this month

“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier,  will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the statement said.
The COG also maintained that its work is “carried out free from any interference”.
While announcing its preliminary findings on Feb 10, 2024, the COG had said that its findings and recommendations would be submitted to the Commonwealth secretary general, before being shared with the Pakistani government, and shared publicly.
 
 

The mission’s report has faced an inordinate delay, as most observation missions compile their findings and publish them within days or weeks of their compilation.
According to an excerpt from the leaked copy — whose authenticity could not be independently verified by Dawn — the report stated that: “Despite the fact that early vote counts indicated a landslide victory for candidates aligned with… the banned PTI… saw their polling leads rapidly reversed…”
In a statement issued on Sunday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the leaked report validated PTI’s longstanding reservations about widespread pre- and post-poll rigging.
Zulfi Bukhari, a former aide to ex-PM Imran Khan, also raised questions about why the report was never released.
“Tomorrow, I will be consulting legal counsel to initiate proceedings aimed at securing disclosure, both of the report itself in full and of the decision-making processes that led to its suppression,” he wrote on X.

• Report warns green channel clearances shrinking scope of pre-clearance controls
ISLAMABAD: The Faceless Customs Assessment (FCA) system, inaugurated by the prime minister last year in Karachi to combat corruption, has incurred a revenue loss of about Rs100 billion in three months.
This was revealed in a detailed analysis by the Pakistan Customs Audit — an internal arrangement of the Federal Board of Revenue — spanning December 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025.
“The scrutiny of 13,140 goods declarations (GDs) led to detection of several discrepancies in 2,530 GDs that raise serious concerns about quality of assessments, indicating revenue and compliance risks,” said the 161-page report, which did not cover 100pc operations.
Of the reviewed GDs, the audit looked into 18pc cleared through the green channel, 76pc through the red channel, and 6pc through the yellow channel, highlighting weaknesses of the system, inefficiency of the human resource, under/overinvoicing, as well as widespread trade-based money laundering.
In some cases, importers of solar panels imported shipments in 2023 and brought containers for clearance more than a year later, prima facie having advance knowledge of the launch of the faceless system.
The audit found duty/tax evasion of Rs5 billion in 1,524 GDs, alongside loss of statutory fines worth Rs2.43bn, besides clearance of restricted goods valued at Rs10.54bn in 1,006 GDs, in violation of intellectual property conditions.
Another potential revenue loss of statutory fines worth Rs30.364bn was reported due to non-framing of contravention cases — based solely on GDs involving duty/tax evasions of Rs1 million or more.
The audit also highlighted fiscal fraud involving cancellation of asse­ssed or finalised GDs (involving duty/tax evasions) and fraudulent clearances of solar panel containers on unauthorised tax numbers “involving trade-based money laundering concerns”.
The analysis revealed that by applying the lowest statutory fine slab of 20pc, under SRO 499(I)/2009, the total fine worth Rs53.549bn sho­uld have been imposed and collected.
“In contrast, only Rs3.480bn was actually imposed/collected…in the 308 cases where contraventions were framed.” Even if cases involving higher duty/tax evasions (worth Rs1 million or above) were considered, the potential revenue loss would still amount to Rs30.364bn.
Transactional audits
The Directorate General of Pak­istan Customs said that due to human resource and time constraints, the directorate primarily relied on transactional audits rather than undertaking entity-based scrutiny, which is more comprehensive in identifying revenue-sensitive factors.
 
 

Moreover, the directorate restr­icted its audit scope to those red, yellow and green channel transactions/GDs that involved payment of duty and taxes.
The massive misuse of the system could be gauged from the fact that a Rs10 million worth of used Toyota Land Cruiser was cleared for a valuation of about Rs17,635, revealing an attempt to significantly misdeclare import values.
“The case reflects a serious risk of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML). By declaring such a nominal purchase amount, the importer appears to have circumvented financial scrutiny, potentially paying the true cost through unofficial or illicit channels as declared value of vehicle had to be paid through remittances originating from foreign countries.”
In case of failure to substantiate that the actual value of the vehicle was paid through foreign country sources, it can raise concerns with regard to funds transferred through illicit channels involving hawala/hundi — a common hallmark of TBML schemes.
Discrepancies
The discrepancies included misclassification of HS Code, misdeclaration of value/non-application of valuation rulings (VRs), violations of SROs involving inadmissible concessions/exemptions, short payment of sales tax on retail price etc.
During the post-clearance audit of cancelled GDs, a fiscal fraud phenomenon was detected where assessed/finalised GDs were cancelled and refiled to evade duty/taxes. The modus operandi were such that GDs were filed by misdeclaring descriptions, HS codes, values, etc.
During examination/assessment when adverse findings were reported involving evasion of duty/taxes, instead of making payments, the importers requested the cancellation of GDs which was allowed. After a gap of a few days/weeks, the same importer again filed GD with same misdeclarations, but this time GDs were assessed at lower duty/taxes in favour of the importers. In this manner, the importers managed to evade duty/taxes while also avoiding fines.
The audit also found glaring examples of using vague descriptions, which eve­n­t­ually culminated in lower value asse­ssments. In such cases, at post-clearance stages, it becomes very difficult to detect misdeclaration beca­use primary lapse lies with the dep­artment/assessing officer who asse­ssed goods at a lower value, thus shi­fting the burden of proof to the department to prove any misdeclaration.
It said 54 solar panel containers belonging to five bogus importers were manifested in the year 2023, but fraudulently cleared through 28 GDs between Dec 2024 and Feb 2025, under different/unauthorised NTNs and Customs User IDs, reflecting exploitation of the FBR’s Registration Module and Customs Computerised System.
Even worse, some of these importers were previously arrested in similar cases and reported themselves as petty employees drawing Rs30,000 in salary. “This forms part of the broader solar panel money laundering scam—already a high-profile case—reflecting a serious systemic lapse”.
The audit highlighted that the increasing quantum of green channel clearances—now covering nearly 60pc of imports and 85pc of exports—is gradually shrinking the scope of pre-clearance controls.
Additionally, limiting visibility of GD particulars under the FCA undermined pre-clearance assessment quality. The audit observed that modern customs administrations operated on the principle of “front-end facilitation with back-end control”, maintaining an optimal balance between the two is critical.
“In Pakistan Customs’ case, front-end facilitation without proportionate back-end oversight has created a structural lag in the taxation framework, escalating both revenue and compliance risks,” the audit said, adding that the green channel had itself turned into a risk area.

RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast rain, wind and thunderstorms across the upper parts of the country from Sept 15 to 19, warning of possible flash floods, landslides and damage to weak structures.
Authorities have been asked to remain vigilant and make necessary arrangements.
The Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains from Sept 16 to 19 in the catchment areas of all major rivers in the province.
According to the Met Office, moist currents of moderate intensity from the Arabian Sea are penetrating the northern regions, while a westerly wave is likely to approach from the evening of Sept 15, persisting until Sept 19.
Under these conditions, rain with thunderstorms is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Char­sadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak and Waziristan between Sept 16 and 19, with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, scattered showers are forecast from the night of Sept 15 to 19, with heavy falls likely on Sept 16 and 18. Similar conditions are expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, including in Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar, between Sept 16 and 19.
In Punjab and Islamabad, rain and thunderstorms are predicted in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum from Sept 16 to 19, with showers likely in Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikh­upura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Faisalabad on Sept 18 and 19. Isolated heavy falls are also expected.
Sindh and most of Balochistan will remain largely dry, with partly cloudy skies in coastal areas.
The PMD warned that windstorms, hailstorms and lightning could damage weak structures such as Katcha houses, billboards, electric poles, vehicles and solar panels.
It also cautioned of landslides in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy rainfall may trigger a rise in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbo­ttabad, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Murree, Galiyat, Islam­abad, Rawalpindi and Kashmir on Sept 18 and 19.
The department advised the public, travellers and tourists to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas and stay updated on the latest weather advisories.
Flood threat in Sindh
With floodwaters moving downstream from Punjab, authorities in Sindh are on high alert as Guddu and Sukkur barrages brace for rising inflows. On Sunday, Guddu Barrage was passing a peak of 627,000 cusecs, with irrigation officials warning the figure could climb to between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs in the coming days.
The Sindh Irrigation Department has identified vulnerable points on both banks of the Indus between Kashmore and Sukkur, particularly in the kutcha (riverine) areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur and Khairpur.
 
 

Officials say constant monitoring and reinforcement work is under way, though they remain cautiously optimistic that the flood peak will pass Sukkur without causing major damage.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Mini­ster Sharjeel Inam Memon has said so far over 163,000 people have been moved from riverine areas to safer location in view of the exp­ected flood.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, he said during the last 24 hours 5,269 people were evacuated from Katcha area.
He added that 252 people from riverine areas were shifted to relief camps, where a total of 469 people are currently staying.
Mr Memon said that 11,569 cattle were moved to safe areas during the last 24 hours, raising the total number of relocated cattle to 438,835.
He added that 51,308 cattle were provided with vaccines and treatment in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number treated to 1.2 million.
He said that the Sindh government has established 177 fixed and mobile health sites, where 6,596 patients were treated in the last 24 hours. So far, a total of 84,118 patients have received medical assistance, he added.
Motorway closure
Meanwhile, Motorway Police said that due to the possibility of damage to the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) as a result of floodwater near Jalalpur Pirwala, it has been closed to traffic.
“Northbound traffic is being redirected from Uch Sharif, Jhangra and Jalalpur Interchange,” Mot­orway Police spokesman Syed Imran Ahmad said in a statement. “Southbound traffic is being diverted from Shah Shams, Sher Shah and Shujaabad South to alternative routes.”
Mr Ahmed added that NHA personnel are placing sandbags and stones to block floodwater.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, water was continuously flowing in its union council, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Bazwala, Khangarh Doma, Sarki, Muradabad, Binda Ishaq, Mudwala, Lati Mari, Kundrala and Seetpur and submerged several villages.

Cotton zones hit
Moreover, for the first time in the country’s history, all major cotton zones in Pakistan have been affected by simultaneous rains and floods.
Though initial assessments suggest no significant damage to the crop nationwide, with the exception of severe losses in the Bahawalnagar district of Punjab, this week is critical for the country’s economy as a major flood surge from south Punjab enters Sindh, with continued rains in some Sindh districts set to determine the fate of cotton and other crops.
Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said in a statement that Pakistan faces its biggest crisis due to Indian water aggression and unexpected rains. The full extent of crop damage, especially to cotton, will not be clear until the end of September.
He noted that the climate changes caused by the rains and floods have led to a minor virus attack on most cotton varieties in many cotton zones. He believes that a spray of urea fertiliser or boron could help mitigate this initial virus attack.
A high-level meeting on cotton rehabilitation, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, was held last week. It was attended by four federal ministers and various stakeholders.
While different proposals were reviewed, it’s widely believed that cotton rehabilitation will be difficult without enforcing crop zoning laws, which include a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones.
Sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones is a major concern. According to Mr Haq, it leads to environmental pollution that not only reduces the quantity of the cotton crop but also negatively impacts its quality. This is evident in regions like Balochistan and areas of Sindh and Punjab bordering Cholistan, where sugarcane is not grown.
The cotton produced in these areas sells for at least Rs500 per maund more than regular cotton because of its longer, stronger fibres and higher oil content in the seeds.
Last week, cotton trading in Pakistan was limited, and prices remained stable at Rs15,500 to Rs16,500 per maund.
Flooding continues
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding continues to ravage south Punjab as broken dykes along the Sutlej and Ravi rivers have submerged hundreds of villages, disrupted major transport routes and displaced millions.
The PDMA and local administrations were managing evacuations and relief efforts amid rising water levels due to broken dykes and controlled breaches.
The evacuation operation continued in Khanewal, Kabirwala, Pir Mahal, Multan, Jalalpur, Jhangra, Uch and Alipur tehsil in Muz­affargarh district.
In Khanewal, several more villages were submerged after a canal dyke of Chak 58 was broken on Saturday night, while the government could not seal the Mai Sufuran dyke at the Ravi River near Head Sidhnai, and the water was inundating villages in Pir Mahal, Khanewal and Kabirwala.
In Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil, the administration carried out a breach at Gillani Road to divert the flood from entering the city two days ago and it submerged several villages of Uch Sharif.
The controlled breach was also not filled after two days, and water continuously passed through it, causing a flood in the Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts.
Jalalpur city also lost its road connection with the Lodhran district after all the roads were submerged after the Noraja Bhutta dyke was broken three days ago. The Sutlej River water changed its direction and submerged several villages near Jalalpur Pirwala city and also reached the motorway exchange.
Relief operations
Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.57 million people of 4,700 mouzas were affected due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers in the province.
Sharing details about Pakistani and Indian dams, Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 93 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, while the Indian Bhakra Dam at the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam 94pc and Thein Dam 88pc.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia on Sunday visited a relief camp in Seetpur union council of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district.
He told the media that evacuations were continued in flooded areas of Alipur, Jalalpur Pirwala and Rahim Yar Khan.
He predicted that the flood situation would ease significantly over the next two days, with only the Chenab at Panjnad Headworks currently in an extremely high flood at 411,000 cusecs. The Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at a medium flood level of 98,000 cusecs, while Head Sulemanki reported a low flood with a discharge of 78,000 cusecs.
Four children drown
Four children, including three siblings, drowned in a rainwater-filled pit in the suburban area of Killi Faiz Muhammad Charmai, Kohlu district, police said on Sunday.
According to police, the children were playing near the pit when they slipped in and were unable to get out. Despite efforts to rescue themselves, all four drowned.
Police and residents rushed to the site after the incident and retrieved the bodies, which were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Kohlu. All had died before reaching the hospital, officials confirmed.
The bodies were later handed over to the families after legal formalities. Residents said they had repeatedly warned the landowner to fill the deep pits, cautioning that they posed a danger to children. However, the owner allegedly continued excavating soil for sale, ignoring the warnings.
