According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij, a term designating members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, seven Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the statement read.
However, Captain Noman Saleem (24, resident of Mianwali), Havaldar Amjad Ali (39, resident of Swabi), Naik Waqas Ahmad (36, resident of Rawalpindi), Sepoy Aijaz Ali (23, resident of Shikarpur), Sepoy Muhammad Waleed (23, resident of Jhelum) and Sepoy Muhammad Shahbaz (32, resident of Khairpur) were all martyred in the gun battle.
Captain Noman was “a brave young medical officer who, besides performing the duties of medical care, also fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his five men,” the statement added.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as relentless counter terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
On Sunday, security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, according to the ISPR.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-10-29 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2922050571d5f6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951994/pti-will-stand-with-pakistan-if-afghan-hostilities-resume-says-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will stand with Pakistan if Afghan hostilities resume, says Gohar</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party would stand with Pakistan if hostilities with Afghanistan resume.
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent weeks, which saw border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Responding to a question on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Gohar said that the PTI would stand with Pakistan in case hostilities with Afghanistan erupt once again, like they did during Islamabad’s brief war with India in May.
“We will stand with Pakistan like we did during the war with India, Afghanistan will not be any different,” he said. “But I will say that Pakistan has to live with its neighbours and it’s in its best interest to live peacefully.”
The PTI chairman quoted a saying in relation to the Afghan situation: “The one who has the most at stake must exhaust all avenues.”
“We have a lot at stake; if Afghanistan has a dialogue going, we need to try other avenues until we reach a consensus,” he stated. “As far as the Afghanistan situation is concerned, it is a serious one, because the Taliban do not completely control the country.”
“If the Afghan Taliban attacked Pakistan, obviously, the response would be like with India, but that does not mean that talking stops during war. Dialogue should happen by all means, but right now, especially, nations friendly to Pakistan should try and use their influence and talk to the Taliban.”
The PTI chairman also noted that Pakistan has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter, but that “Afghanistan has the same right”.
“As neighbours, we need to understand each other,” he said.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. They, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-10-29 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29211226b365a91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951992/hurricane-melissa-strongest-storm-ever-to-hit-jamaica-roars-onward-into-cuba' target='_blank'><strong>Hurricane Melissa, strongest storm ever to hit Jamaica, roars onward into Cuba</strong></a><br><p>Hurricane Melissa unleashed devastation in Jamaica as the strongest storm on record ever to hit the Caribbean island nation, and roared later on Wednesday into eastern Cuba, smashing the city of Santiago and flooding rural land.
A Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour when it barrelled into Jamaica, Melissa had been downgraded to a still dangerous Category 3 when it hit Cuba with sustained winds of 120mph, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
“Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and landslides, and damaging hurricane winds are ongoing this morning,” the centre said.
The historic storm blasted western Jamaica, demolishing homes, knocking down swathes of trees and washing out roadways. Authorities did not yet release details of fatalities but said they expected loss of life.
Eyewitness reports and videos on social media from Jamaica showed vehicles destroyed by flying debris, hotel doors blown off hinges and roofs scattered across neighborhoods. Video of the airport in Montego Bay showed inundated seating areas, broken glass and collapsed ceilings.
The storm was expected to weaken some as it crossed Cuba but would remain a dangerous hurricane upon reaching the Bahamas.
In eastern Cuba, around 735,000 people were evacuated from homes as the storm approached, authorities said. By mid-morning, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Cuba had already suffered extensive damage and warned residents against letting down their guard, urging them to remain sheltered.
‘Some loss of life expected,’ Jamaican leader says
In southwestern Jamaica, the parish of St Elizabeth was left “underwater”, an official said, with more than 500,000 residents without power.
“The reports that we have had so far would include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well, and damage to our road infrastructure,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said on CNN after the storm had passed.
The government had not yet received news of any confirmed deaths from the storm, but given the strength of the hurricane and the extent of the damage, “we are expecting that there would be some loss of life,” Holness said.
“It was so crazy. Like a freight train trying to come to a stop for eight hours,” said Journie Ealey, 34, a US tourist on vacation in Jamaica, reached by phone.
“I’ve never experienced anything like this before.”
Meteorologists at AccuWeather said Melissa ranked as the third most intense hurricane observed in the Caribbean, after Wilma in 2005 and Gilbert in 1988 — the last major storm to make landfall in Jamaica.
Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries.
Melissa’s winds subsided as the storm drifted past the mountains of Jamaica, lashing highland communities vulnerable to landslides and flooding.
“Our country has been ravaged by Hurricane Melissa but we will rebuild and we will do so even better than before,” Prime Minister Holness said earlier today.
US President Donald Trump said today he was prepared to assist Jamaica’s recovery. The State Department said it would send search-and-rescue teams.
In the Bahamas, next in line after Cuba in Melissa’s path to the northeast, the government ordered evacuations of residents in southern portions of that archipelago.
Farther to the east, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic had faced days of torrential downpours leading to at least four deaths, authorities there said.

Cuba hit

The storm’s centre, churning with violent wind gusts over 125mph and heavy rain, slammed early today into Guama, a rural, mountainous area 25 miles west of Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second most populous city.
The storm pressed on north-northeast across eastern Cuba. Authorities had shut down power to virtually all of eastern Cuba, evacuated vulnerable areas and had asked residents to shelter in place in the provincial capital Santiago, a city of 400,000 people.

Photos and videos posted earlier today on local media and eyewitness accounts in the city laid bare a chaotic scene, with downed power lines, shattered windows, trees and debris littering roadways.
In more rural areas to the west, videos showed torrents of brown rainwater rushing down roads through dark towns at the base of Cuba’s Sierra Maestra mountains. As the storm passed, winds remained too strong by mid-morning for residents to venture onto the streets.
Authorities reported widespread flooding of lowland areas earlier today from Santiago to Guantanamo, where upwards of 35 per cent of the population had been evacuated.

The timing could hardly be worse for the communist-run Caribbean island, already suffering from food, fuel, electricity and medicine shortages that have complicated life, prompting record-breaking emigration since 2021.
President Diaz-Canel said Cuba had mobilized 2,500 electric line workers who would begin recovery immediately following the storm’s passage across the island later today.
The hurricane was not expected to directly affect the capital Havana.</p><small>2025-10-29 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2918451355ff470.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951986/dig-traffics-vehicle-runs-afoul-of-karachis-new-e-challan-initiative-fined-rs10000' target='_blank'><strong>DIG Traffic’s vehicle runs afoul of Karachi’s new e-challan initiative, fined Rs10,000</strong></a><br><p>The vehicle of DIG Traffic Pir Mohammad Shah was issued an e-challan on Wednesday for violating traffic rules.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid the port city witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The e-ticket was issued to the DIG’s vehicle at the Lyari Interchange as the driver was not wearing a seatbelt.
“My driver was issued the e-challan for not wearing a seatbelt,” said the senior police official while speaking to Dawn.com.
He added that his driver was fined a sum of Rs10,000.
According to a press release by the Sindh police dated October 28, 1,535 challans have been issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for over speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving.
Earlier this month, Inspector General (IG) of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said the biggest problem in the metropolis is a lack of trained drivers, who are also responsible for tragic accidents.
Meanwhile, Additional IG of Karachi Javed Alam Odho said a faceless e-ticketing system would end abuse of powers by police and their negative attitude towards the public.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2919300576ed634.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951989/russia-tests-nuclear-capable-poseidon-super-torpedo-putin-says' target='_blank'><strong>Russia tests nuclear-capable Poseidon super torpedo, Putin says</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia had successfully tested the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
As United States President Donald Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon, named after the ancient Greek god of the sea, but it is essentially a nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone.
Putin, over tea and cakes at a hospital in Moscow with Russian soldiers wounded in the Ukraine war, said the test had taken place on Tuesday.
“For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,” Putin said.
“There is nothing like this,” he said, adding there was no way to intercept the Poseidon, which analysts believe has a range of 10,000 kilometres and can travel at about 185km per hour.
The Burevestnik and Poseidon tests are intended to send a clear message that Russia, in Putin’s words, will never bow to Western pressure over the war in Ukraine.
For Trump, who has called Russia a “paper tiger” for failing to swiftly subdue Ukraine, the message is that Russia remains a global military competitor, especially on nuclear weapons, and that Moscow’s overtures on nuclear arms control should be acted on.
Poseidon and the new nuclear arms race
The Poseidon is a new weapon that has appeared amid what Putin has cast as a global arms race — primarily between the United States, Russia and China — to modernise and develop their nuclear arsenals.
Poseidon, known in Nato as Kanyon, is 20 metres long, 1.8 metres in diameter and weighs 100 tonnes, according to Russian media.
Arms control experts say the weapon breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. They have estimated it would carry a two megaton warhead and perhaps is powered with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Putin said Poseidon’s power exceeded that of “even our most promising Sarmat intercontinental-range missile”, which is known as SS-X-29, or Satan II.
Since first announcing the Poseidon and Burevestnik in 2018, Putin has cast them as a response to US moves to build a missile defence shield after Washington in 2001 unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as well as to Nato’s eastern enlargement.
After Russia’s test of the Burevestnik, Trump said Putin should end the war in Ukraine instead of testing a nuclear-powered missile.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29184406d5b03d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951981/preparations-underway-to-transfer-brown-bear-rano-to-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Preparations underway to transfer brown bear Rano to GB</strong></a><br><p>Authorities have started preparations to transfer Rano, a bear currently residing in Karachi Zoo, to Gilgit-Baltistan on the Sindh High Court’s (SHC) directives.
Earlier this month, SHC ordered the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to relocate the animal from Karachi Zoological Gardens to the Bear Sanctuary managed by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board within two days, marking an end to the years-long plight of the brown bear.
Today, Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah chaired a high-level meeting at the Sindh Secretariat to review the arrangements for Rano’s relocation, a statement by the secretary’s spokesperson Farhat Imtiaz Janwari said.
The meeting was attended by the Secretary Forest and Wildlife, Municipal Commissioner KMC, Conservator Sindh Wildlife Department, representatives from the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, and other wildlife experts.
The participants briefed the chief secretary on the progress made so far regarding the bear’s transfer, the statement added. The Sindh Wildlife Department informed the meeting that a specially designed iron cage meeting all safety standards has been prepared for Rano’s relocation.
“It was further informed that wildlife experts and trainers are currently engaged in daily training sessions to help Rano adjust comfortably to the new cage.”
Dr Aamir and Mrs Abida Raees from Karachi Zoo, wildlife rangers Abbas, Anees, and Sanna Raja from the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, and wildlife trainer Abid from the Sindh Wildlife Department are jointly supervising Rano’s behavioural training, per the statement.
According to experts, Rano has shown a positive response to the training. She has developed a friendly bond with wildlife ranger Sanna Raja and eagerly awaits her daily visits near the cage. Rano has also begun eating honey directly from Sanna’s hand, indicating strong trust and progress in her behavioral adaptation.
Shah directed that Rano must not be forcibly captured or sedated during the transfer process. He emphasised that the bear should voluntarily enter the transport cage through gradual and positive reinforcement training methods.
The chief secretary also instructed that the entire transfer process be recorded on video for documentation and transparency. He also directed the Sindh Wildlife Department to ensure that all arrangements in Islamabad are completed before Rano’s transfer.
As per the Sindh High Court’s order, Rano will first be shifted to Islamabad and then to her final sanctuary destination in Gilgit-Baltistan.
He further directed the Wildlife Department to forward a case to the Sindh Cabinet proposing a complete ban on the import of exotic (non-native) animals.
Shah observed that exotic animals suffer from depression and trauma due to the lack of a natural habitat and climatic compatibility in captivity.
He added that Pakistan is a party to several international conventions, including the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Chief Secretary Shah stressed that wildlife protection and ethical management of animals must be ensured in all zoos and wildlife habitats across Sindh in accordance with both local and international standards.

Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29193317af77c88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951972/fact-check-viral-video-of-putin-warning-pakistan-while-offering-support-to-afghanistan-is-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact-check: Viral video of Putin warning Pakistan while offering support to Afghanistan is doctored</strong></a><br><p>Posts from pro-Afghan and Indian users on social media platform X on Wednesday were sharing a video claiming it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin warning Pakistan’s army and offering support to Afghanistan amid the current tensions between the two countries. However, the video is dubbed over and has nothing to do with Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of Oct 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
Today, a video of the Russian president was shared by an Afghan user on X with the following caption: “Breaking news: Putin’s warning to Pakistan’s military regime. We are ready to provide all kinds of military and civilian assistance to the people of Afghanistan when needed. We do not want anyone to disrupt the peace of Afghans.”
The audio of the video was in Persian and the transcription is provided below:
“They are encouraging Islamabad to pressure the oppressed people of Afghanistan. Their goal is clear, to break Afghanistan, to prevent the formation of a state in Kabul and to create a circle of siege against Russia, Iran and China. But we know this scenario very well and we will not allow history to repeat itself.“
Russia stands by the people of Afghanistan, the people who have been victims of occupation for decades, but still have not given up. I openly declare that any threat to the integrity of Afghanistan’s territory, any threat to the stability and the security of the region, including political and legal support, and if necessary, even military support, should be understood that Pakistan has serious consequences. We do not want this country to be turned into a battlefield of great powers.
But if the Pakistani army or its opposition groups want to invade Afghanistan, not only from Kabul, but also from other places, they will be able to do so. We told Washington in the past, and I will repeat it again, to stop the movement of the region. They have been defeated in Ukraine, they have been trapped in the Middle East, and now they are looking for a solution in Central Russia.
This is our territory, not your territory. Afghanistan is a small country, but with a big heart. The Afghan people will stand up against terrorism and occupation, and today they will stand up against rape.
We consider this standing as a legitimate right. Russia welcomes any economic, security and defence cooperation with Kabul. We are ready to strengthen our military and information infrastructure to defend the borders of Afghanistan.”
The post gained 22,000 views.
Several other pro-Afghan and pro-Indian accounts on X also shared the same video with similar claims as can be seen here here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here, collectively gaining 171,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter amid ongoing tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether Putin had actually uttered any such remarks yielded no news reports from credible mainstream Russian, international, Pakistani or Afghan media outlets.
Analysing the audio of the video using forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detects potential manipulation throughout the audio spectrum, showed a Fake-O-Meter score of 82.3 per cent.
The score indicates a very high probability of AI-generated or synthetically altered content.
 


A reverse image search using keyframes from the clip led to a Reuters YouTube video uploaded on October 24, 2025, titled: “Putin says new US sanctions won’t affect Russia’s economy | REUTERS” that notably featured the same background, location and clothing as the viral clip.
The video showed Putin addressing reporters during a media briefing in Moscow in which he said he would not bow to pressure from the United States or any other country after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies.
 


A keyword search further led to a Reuters news report published on October 23, 2025, titled “Putin defiant after Trump sanctions Russian oil companies over Ukraine”.
As per the report, Putin had criticised sanctions on its oil companies by the US and said they would not significantly affect the Russian economy while talked up Russia’s importance to the global market. He had warned that a sharp supply drop would push up prices and be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.
The article made no mention of Pakistan, Afghanistan or any related warning by Putin.
The same story was also reported the same day by Al Jazeera, confirming that the media address was focused solely on Russia’s economic response to US sanctions and the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral clip shows Russian President Vladimir Putin warning Pakistan while expressing support for Afghanistan amid the tensions between the two countries is false. The clip is doctored and has been dubbed over through AI-generated audio.

Since then, Trump has frequently highlighted his role in averting what he described as a potential nuclear confrontation between the two neighbours.
On June 19, President Trump extended an unprecedented invitation to Pakistan’s Army Chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, for a historic luncheon at the White House. The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal.”
Field Marshal Munir became the first serving Chief of Army Staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president after joining the US President.
The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Analysts are of the view that, despite decades of military cooperation between the two nations, the optics of the meeting were without precedent.
‘Honoured’ to meet field marshal
In his first comments after the White House lunch with Field Marshal Munir, Trump told the media that he “was honoured to meet him.”
“The reason I had him (Field Marshal Munir) here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago.”
Earlier, when questioned by reporters on the White House lawn about the diplomatic outcomes expected from the meeting with Field Marshal Munir, Trump remarked, “This man was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”
‘Exceptional human being, inspiring personality’
On June 25, the US president, while speaking about the India-Pakistan ceasefire, described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms.
He said: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week.“ The same day, the US president had described the army chief as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality”.
‘A great, great guy’
On September 25, before Trump was scheduled to meet PM Shehbaz and COAS during their visit to the US, the president called the army chief “a great, great guy”.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.
 


‘Very important guy’
On September 29, during an address at an event in Quantico, Virginia, Trump mentioned the Army chief.
“He is a very important guy in Pakistan … and I didn’t even realise it, as beautiful as he said it to a group of people who were with it … he said this man (Trump) saved millions of lives.
“I was very honoured, I loved the way he said it”, the US president said.
 






Lauds COAS for Gaza ceasefire proposal
On September 30, in a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump thanked PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir for their support on a Gaza ceasefire proposal.
“The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated.
“They back this 100 per cent,“ he said, referring to the ceasefire proposal.
 


‘My favourite field marshal’
On October 13, in what was possibly Trump’s most unforgettable remark about Field Marshal Munir, Trump termed him his “favourite field marshal”.
Thanking several world leaders for their role in the Gaza peace plan, Trump also did the same for Pakistan, saying: “Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and also I have to say my favourite Field Marshal from Pakistan, who is not here, but the prime minister is here and you are gonna give him his regards.”
“Where are you?” he asked as he turned around to look at the world leaders gathered in the back. Noticing PM Shehbaz in the back, Trump then called him forward and asked him to say a few words.
Field marshal, PM Shehbaz ‘great people’
Within the same week, on October 26, the US president, on the sidelines of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit, made the following comments about the COAS while speaking about the Pakistan-Afghanistan dispute.
Speaking of PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir, Trump said: “I know them both … the Pakistan field marshal and the prime minister are great people, and I know we’re gonna get that done quickly. That one started up a few days ago.“
Lauds COAS for role in Pak-India ceasefire
A day earlier, Trump, addressing a dinner with business leaders during his trip to Japan, Trump, praised the COAS and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while claiming credit for brokering the May 10 ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
“If you look at India and Pakistan, they were going at it,” he said. “Seven brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down.
“I said to [Indian] Prime Minister Modi and I said to the Prime Minister [Shehbaz Sharif], very nice man, a very good man and the Field Marshal [Asim Munir] over in Pakistan … I said, ‘look we’re not going to do any trade if you’re going to be fighting’,” Trump said.
‘Great fighter’
On October 29 (today), Trump praised the COAS, calling him a “great fighter”, while talking about India and Pakistan at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year.
In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.“

The report, written by Francesca Albanese and available with Dawn.com, notes that Israel’s actions were not carried out in isolation, but with the aid of “third states”.
“The genocide in Gaza was not committed in isolation, but as part of a system of global complicity,” the report stated.
“Rather than ensuring that Israel respects the basic human rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people, powerful third states — perpetuating colonial and racial-capitalist practices that should have long been consigned to history — have allowed violent practices to become an everyday reality.”
The report adds that foreign countries facilitating Israel and shielding it from accountability have enabled Tel Aviv to “embed its regime of settler-colonial apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territory”.

It adds that the Gaza genocide needs to be understood as an “internationally enabled crime”.
“Many states, primarily Western ones, have facilitated, legitimised and eventually normalised the genocidal campaign perpetrated by Israel,” the report read.
“By portraying Palestinian civilians as ‘human shields’ … and the broader onslaught in Gaza as a battle of civilisation against barbarism, they have reproduced the Israeli distortions of international law and colonial tropes, seeking to justify their own complicity in genocide.”
The report noted that successful measures implemented against Apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia and other colonial regimes “demonstrate that international law can be enforced to secure justice and self-determination”.
It added that the international community has the same legal and moral obligation to apply these and other measures against any state perpetrating apartheid.
“Their failure to hold Israel accountable for its long-standing international crimes — despite clear orders from international courts — exposes the flagrant double standards of the international community,” the report read.
It further noted that states have a range of options to prevent violations of international law, including the use of force, arms and trade embargoes, the denial of safe passage and prosecution and punishment.
Diplomatic and political actions
The UN report states that “influential” third countries’ support of Israel has enabled it to continue its attack on Palestine, through their adoption of Israeli narratives and Washington’s vetoing of UN Security Council resolutions against Tel Aviv.
The report added that Israel has not been expelled from international fora in sports and culture.

“States reverted to treating the situation as a humanitarian crisis to be managed, rather than resolved, by demanding that Israel end its unlawful occupation once and for all, providing further leeway to the assault on Gaza,” it stated.
 
 

It added that in February 2024, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands criticised Israel’s invasion of Rafah while simultaneously withdrawing funding from the UN Works and Relief Agency (UNRWA).
The UN also noted that sanctions on Israeli settlers and extremist organisations — including on far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir — created the “illusion of progress” and were isolated acts.
While Arab and Muslim states have long supported the Palestinian cause and produced some collective effort, “these actions have not been decisive, even amid Israeli aggression against six Arab states.”
Additionally, legal action has not borne any fruit, with only 13 states joining South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice and many Western nations “persistently” denying that a genocide took place in Gaza.
Military relations
The UN noted that while evidence of genocide has mounted, nations are still trading and sending arms to Israel.
“Israel is disproportionately dependent on weapons imports, with the proportion of their total trade more than double the OECD average, and over four times greater than that of the United States,” the report read, naming the US, Germany and Italy among the biggest suppliers.
“The third US–Israel MoU (memorandum of understanding), effective until 2028, guarantees $3.3 billion [per] year in FMF (foreign military financing) plus $500 million [per] year for missile defence.”

The report stated that since October 2023, the US has transferred 742 consignments of “arms and ammunition” and approved tens of billions in new weapon sales.
“Between October 2023 and October 2025, 26 States sent at least 10 consignments of “arms and ammunition” to Israel, the most frequent being China, including Taiwan, India, Italy, Austria, Spain, Czechia, Romania and France,” it read.
Though the UK did not directly supply arms, it did allow for a US supply line to Tel Aviv through its bases in Cyprus and flew 600 surveillance flights over Gaza during the past two years.
Weaponising aid
The report further stated that third countries were complicit in degrading the living conditions in Gaza, not only by facilitating Israel but also by failing to deliver adequate aid to Palestinians in the enclave.
“Since October 2023, Israel has turned existing restrictions into a full blockade. From October 2023 to January 2025, aid was limited to an average of 107 trucks per day — less than one-third of pre-2023 levels,” the report read, adding that by August this year, famine had been declared in the Gaza Strip.
“The genocidal campaign by Israel has deliberately sought to destroy the humanitarian system sustaining the occupied population,” it further stated.
“It (Israel) has done so through directly bombing UNRWA warehouses, food distribution sites, schools and clinics, killing more than 370 personnel, [launching] defamation campaigns against UNRWA and promoting ad hoc pseudo-humanitarian agencies.”
Instead of opposing Israel’s blockade, nations including Canada, the UK, Belgium, Denmark and Jordan airdropped aid packages in what the report calls an “expensive, inadequate and dangerous response”.
 
 

“Naval aid missions to Gaza, attempts by civil society groups to break the siege
have been unlawfully intercepted by Israel in international waters — amid silence and inaction by third states,” the report read.
Trade ties
Noting that Israel is heavily dependent on foreign trade for its economy, the report stated that no Western countries have halted trade ties in the face of Israeli violations of international law. In fact, trade between Israel and some countries grew.

Germany (+$836m)
Poland (+$237m)
Greece (+$186m)
Italy (+$117m)
Denmark (+$99m)
France (+$75m)
Serbia (+$56m)
The United Arab Emirates (+$237m)
Egypt (+$199m)
Jordan (+$41m)
Morocco (+$6m)

“Besides the suspension of the trade agreement with Israel, states must also suspend all trade with Israel in dual-use products, as the [European Union] did with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine,” the report urged. “
“Energy trade has often been subject to embargoes aimed at bringing countries in line with their international legal obligations: examples include apartheid South Africa and, currently, Russia and Iran,” it added. “In the case of Israel, only Colombia, which banned coal exports to Israel in 2024, has acted.”
The report stated in its conclusion: “Even as the genocidal violence became visible, states, mostly Western ones, have provided, and continue to provide, Israel with military, diplomatic, economic and ideological support, even as it weaponised famine and humanitarian aid.
“The horrors of the past two years are not an aberration, but the culmination of a long history of complicity.”
Through omissions and discourse in support of Israel, third countries “could and should be held liable for aiding, assisting or jointly participating in internationally wrongful acts”.
“At this critical juncture, it is imperative that third states immediately suspend and review all military, diplomatic and economic relations with Israel, as any such engagement could represent means to aid/assist/directly participate in unlawful acts, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”
The report recommended that states do the following:

Exert pressure for a complete and permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops
Take immediate steps to end the siege in Gaza, including deploying naval
and land convoys to ensure safe humanitarian access and mobile housing before winter
Support the re-opening of Gaza’s international airport and port to facilitate aid delivery
Recognise Palestinian self-determination and justice as essential to lasting peace and security
Suspend all military, trade and diplomatic relations with Israel
Investigate and prosecute all officials, corporates, and individuals involved in or facilitating genocide, incitement, crimes against humanity and war crimes and other grave breaches of international humanitarian law
Secure reparations, including full reconstruction and return
Cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice
Reaffirm and strengthen support to UNRWA and the UN system as a whole
Suspend Israel from the United Nations under Article 6 (a member of the United Nations who has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organisation by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council) of the UN Charter
Act under “Uniting for Peace”, in line with the General Assembly resolution
377(V), to ensure that Israel dismantles its occupation

A day ago, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reached a severe peak of 422 but dropped to 341 today — still categorised as “hazardous” — keeping it at the top of the list of cities with the poorest air quality.
Behind the Punjab capital in the rankings were New Delhi with an AQI score of 232, Beijing at 222, Kinshasa and Kathmandu at 155 each, and Karachi at 140.
 


The Punjab government has taken notice of the situation and raised a high alert, including revising school timings across the province to begin at 8:35am.
In response to the crisis, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has also launched a large-scale anti-smog operation, deploying 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers, and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling.
Meanwhile, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, praised the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in handling the anti-smog operations, calling her hard work “a testament to the success of the vision of improving the environment”.
“In the coming years, Punjab will see improvements like Beijing,” she said.
She added that the improvements and measures taken to reduce smog had played a role in changing the mindset of farmers.
According to a report by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), this year’s environmental violations score was 294.
“Action is underway against plants causing air pollution,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29175900f315d74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951976/airspace-constraints-a-challenge-to-air-indias-on-time-performance-says-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Airspace constraints a challenge to Air India’s on-time performance, says CEO</strong></a><br><p>Air India’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Campbell Wilson acknowledged on Wednesday that airspace closures posed a challenge to the airline’s timely performance.
The airline has faced delayed jet deliveries and airspace closures due to geopolitical tensions, including bans imposed by Islamabad since April, when tensions with New Delhi intensified.
“Airspace constraints are a challenge to on-time performance,” CEO Wilson said at an Aviation India event in India’s capital city, speaking publicly for the first time since the June crash of the Boeing Dreamliner in Ahmedabad.
 
 

“We’re always looking at how we can keep improving,” CEO Wilson stated. “This year will be quite challenging from a business perspective … We’re also working with the investigators,” he added.
On April 24, in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect.
India and Pakistan fought their fiercest military conflict in decades in May, sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in India-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people. New Delhi, without evidence, alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe.
Since then, the two nuclear-armed neighbours have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines, with Islamabad most recently extending the ban till November 24.
 
 

According to a company letter seen by Reuters, Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if the ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year.
Other Indian airlines, including IndiGo, also face higher fuel costs and longer journey times as they reroute international flights. Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Airports Authority (PAA) also reported a shortfall of Rs4.1 billion in August, just over two months after closing its airspace to Indian-registered aircraft.
The delay in jet deliveries and airspace restrictions have weighed on Air India’s performance as it strives to recover from the plane crash of June 12 that killed 260 people.
The Tata Group-owned carrier has been facing intense scrutiny ever since the crash, from warning notices for running planes without checking emergency equipment to not changing engine parts in time and forging records, along with other lapses related to crew fatigue management.
India’s air accident investigating agency published an interim report earlier this year saying the plane’s fuel engine switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291258198858603.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951961/trump-again-praises-great-guy-pm-shehbaz-and-great-fighter-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Trump again praises ‘great guy’ PM Shehbaz and ‘great fighter’ COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May.
Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both Pakistan and India, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year.
“I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
 
 

“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too.
“And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said.
The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.”
He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.
“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’.
“And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.”
Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”.
 


“But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing?
“You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.”
He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.”
The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs, saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said.
Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29162313f6997a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951974/pakistan-receives-first-ever-us-crude-oil-shipment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan receives first-ever US crude oil shipment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday received its first-ever shipment of US crude with the cargo arriving at Cnergyico’s offshore terminal, marking a new chapter in Pak-US trade relations.
The cargo arrived aboard the Suezmax vessel MT Pegasus and docked at Cnergyico’s Single Point Mooring (SPM) port situated on the coast of Balochistan.
In August, it was reported that Cnergyico will import 1 million barrels of oil from Vitol this month.
“The arrival of Pakistan’s first-ever US crude oil cargo marks an important milestone for the country’s energy sector and for Cnergyico,” Vice Chairman of Cnergyico Pk Limited Usama Qureshi told Dawn.com.
“This first shipment will be followed by another in mid-November and a third in January 2026,” he stated, adding that collectively, “these three cargoes are expected to improve Pakistan’s trade balance with the United States by around $200 million”.
Qureshi said the SPM facility, the country’s only offshore crude handling terminal, can efficiently receive large vessels, reduce logistics costs, and enhance refinery operations.
“These imports not only diversify Pakistan’s crude supply but also strengthen bilateral trade ties and contribute to the country’s long-term energy security,” the vice chairman added.
In September, Cnergyico had ordered a second shipment of US crude after finding its debut purchase commercially viable, according to its vice chairman, paving the way for more imports.
In 2023, Cnergyico had imported the country’s first private-sector shipment of Russian crude oil, taking advantage of Moscow’s discounts on its oil exports.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29171916f222b18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951977/social-media-post-case-imaan-mazaris-husband-arrested-at-islamabad-court-for-intentionally-not-appearing' target='_blank'><strong>Social media post case: Imaan Mazari’s husband arrested at Islamabad court for ‘intentionally not appearing’</strong></a><br><p>Hadi Ali Chattha, husband of rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, was arrested from outside the courtroom in Islamabad on Wednesday in a case related to controversial social media posts.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued an arrest warrant for him at the hearing and adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow.
Mazari also posted on X about the arrest, saying: “My husband, Hadi Ali, has been arrested because Judge Majoka is insistent on committing misconduct. Hadi appeared in court today and despite his appearance the … judge ordered his arrest.”
Sharing a picture of the short order, she termed it “completely illegal” in a subsequent post, saying there was video evidence inside and outside the courtroom of Hadi being present.
“Today case was fixed for framing of charge and prosecution evidence. Hadi Ali Chattha accused has intentionally not appeared in court. Hence, his bail bonds are forfeited and non-bailable warrant of arrest be issued against him” for tomorrow, the short order said.
In a video shared by journalist Matiullah Jan on X, Chattha claimed there had been three hearings in the case since morning and he was present in the courtroom but the judge had refused to come out from his chambers while conveying the message that he would issue an arrest warrant for him.
“I am saying to him that I am present so why will you issue my arrest warrant. If there is any proceeding then tell me I am present in court. This is misconduct that he is refusing to come out from his chambers and is saying from inside: ‘No, you go away and I want to issue your arrest warrant.’”
Chattha said it would be a “great injustice” if lawyers were tried in courts, proceedings were not conducted and then judges said that they would issue arrest warrants for them no matter what.
 






Journalist Saqib Bashir said the entire situation was “surprising” since arrest warrants were issued to ensure appearance in court and were normally cancelled when those undergoing trial appeared in court.
 






Journalist Baqi Sajjad termed the arrest a “continuation of the persecution of the human rights activists”.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The case has been registered under Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29170749a1e68b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951957/asif-warns-afghanistan-of-deep-strikes-if-pakistan-attacked-from-its-soil' target='_blank'><strong>Asif warns Afghanistan of ‘deep strikes’ if Pakistan attacked from its soil</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the Taliban regime on Wednesday that Islamabad would strike “deep into Afghanistan” if Afghan soil was used to launch terror attacks on Pakistan.
In a pre-dawn announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the latest round of talks between the two countries in Turkiye, which aimed to address cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil, “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
“We will conduct strikes, we definitely will,” Asif told reporters at Parliament House, when asked about the options available for Pakistan in case of cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
“If their territory is used and they violate our territory, then, if we need to go deep into Afghanistan to retaliate, we surely will,” he added.
Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”.
Speaking about the recently collapsed talks today, Asif said, “Kabul was not sincere at any level for any arrangement. On the directives of India and by becoming its proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan wants to leverage its position over Pakistan through Afghanistan.”
He added, “The entire leadership of Kabul is playing in the hands of India.”
 


The minister noted that working groups from both Pakistan and Afghanistan were present in Istanbul. He added that despite an agreement being close, Kabul prevented it.
“Again and again, whenever something was finalised and an agreement was drafted — this happened three or four times I think — they contacted Kabul and a ‘no’ came from Kabul, because of which we could not reach an agreement with them,” Asif detailed.
He further said that if those in Kabul had chosen the path of confrontation, then “so be it”.
Speaking further about the persistent issues during the recent dialogue, Asif said the other side acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
 
 

“They were agreeing with everything but were not ready to give in writing,” the defence minister said.
Responding to a query, Asif stated that including TTP in the talks was not discussed. “Even if they had said so, it would have been a total refusal from us,” he asserted.
The minister went on to say that even the mediators — Qatar and Turkiye — now knew of the “futoor (infirmity)” in Kabul’s intentions. “We made this attempt with full sincerity so that Pakistan and Afghanistan can live in peace as good neighbours.
“But if they have handed over their reins to Delhi, then this will be difficult,” he added.
“It can only be prayed, [but] there’s no medicine,” Asif quipped, when asked about the likelihood of better sense prevailing.
‘Afghanistan does not fulfil definition of state’
The minister said the legitimate status of the Afghan Taliban as the government was not clear and did not have international recognition, except for a few countries.
“That government does not have its writ in the entire Afghanistan. Afghanistan is practically shattered into pieces, where one or the other influential terrorist group … there is a congregation of international terrorism there,” Asif said.
 
 

The defence minister said Afghanistan neither “fulfils the definition of a state” nor did the interim administration consider it so. “They are the ones who are involved in the killings, and they are taking financial benefits by being the rulers.”
Asked whether the Afghan Taliban were taking their country towards a similar situation as the United States’ military operation in Tora Bora in December 2001, Asif said, “It is definitely a possibility.”
‘Test our resolve and capabilities at your own peril’
Asif’s latest remarks come hours after he issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them to test Islamabad’s resolve at their
“own peril and doom” if they wished to do so.
“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X.
 






The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”.
“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.”
 
 

Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”.
“Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said.
In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country.
 
 

“As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented.
He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”.
“If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!”
UN expresses concern over talk failure
In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”.
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN.
“Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported.
From border skirmishes to talk failure
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.

The development comes over a week after the PTI formally requested the appointment of Achakzai — whose party is also part of opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ain-e-Pakistan (TTAP) along with five other parties, including the PTI  — as leader of the opposition in the NA.
The position of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan on August 5.
On August 20, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan named Achakzai for the post of NA Opposition Leader in the NA.
According to a statement posted on JUI-F’s X account today, a PTI delegation visited Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s residence in Islamabad, “where the JUI-F agreed to support the nomination of Mehmood Khan Achakzai”.
 






The PTI delegation included Asad Qaiser, PTI Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) President Junaid Akbar and  Shahram Khan Tarakai, while JUI-F chief Fazl was accompanied by Maulana Salahuddin Ayubi, Advocate Jalaluddin, and his son, Maulana Asjad Mehmood.
During the meeting, “the PTI delegation appealed to the JUI-F chief to play a role in uniting the opposition in parliament,” the statement said, adding that the PTI also asked the JUI-F to “cooperate” with it regarding a vacant Senate seat from KP.
The two sides also discussed the current political and regional situation, it further stated.
According to the statement, the PTI also “consulted the JUI-F chief on the proposal to hold a national jirga over the law and order situation in KP”.
For his part, Fazl welcomed the proposal, the statement said.
A subsequent post on the TTAP’s X account said Qaiser “briefed Achakzai in detail about his meeting with Fazl and took him into confidence”.
 






The post also stated it was decided during the meeting that the TTAP would hold public gatherings in across the country in November.
Earlier this week, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja had said that the PTI did not see a possibility of the JUI-F supporting it for the NA opposition leader slot.
In response to a question regarding chatter of a new NA opposition leader and whether the JUI-F would support the PTI, Raja had said, “Cons­idering the past, I don’t think they will go with us at the end, and whether they form an alliance with the PPP or the PML-N, I cannot say anything about it, but we (PTI) don’t really have any interest in it.”
The same day, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had met with Fazl, where the two discussed the formulation of a joint strategy on key national issues.</p><small>2025-10-29 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29171903b07011a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951978/pakistan-iran-partners-in-regional-peace-and-stability-naqvi-says-in-meeting-with-president-pezeshkian' target='_blank'><strong>‘Pakistan, Iran partners in regional peace and stability,’ Naqvi says in meeting with President Pezeshkian</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday hailed Iran and Pakistan as partners in maintaining regional peace and stability during a meeting with President Masoud Pezeshkian.
Pakistan and Iran agreed in August that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Pakistan and Iran share close ties but persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained relations.
The interior minister is currently on a visit to Iran at a time of sustained tension with two of Pakistan’s neighbours, Iran and Afghanistan.
A press release issued today said he met President Pezeshkian, with the two discussing bilateral and bilateral cooperation.
“Iran and Pakistan are partners in regional peace and stability,” the press release quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that he conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “message of goodwill” to President Pezeshkian.
The interior minister also briefed the Iranian president on matters related to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with Pezeshkian offering to play a “fraternal role” in easing the tensions between the two countries.
 






President Pezeshkian said Iran attached “special importance” to its relations with Pakistan and it could not forget the “immense support” from Islamabad.
Expressing satisfaction over bilateral relations, the Iranian president stressed the need for enhanced cooperation between the two countries to take advantage of vast opportunities.
Islamabad and Tehran’s renewed commitment to maintaining regional peace comes at a time when Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
Meetings with Iranian security officials
Naqvi also held separate meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Ardeshir Larijani and Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni during his visit to Tehran.
Naqvi and Larijani discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the field of security.
The meeting focused on counterterrorism, anti-narcotics efforts, and improved border management between the two, with both sides emphasising the need for closer collaboration and institutional linkages to address shared challenges.
“We are keen to expand cooperation with Iran, especially in the areas of security and counter-narcotics,” Naqvi said.
Secretary Larijani described the positive progress in bilateral relations as “encouraging and constructive”.
In a separate meeting, the two interior ministers discussed expanding mutual cooperation on internal security matters. Naqvi congratulated his Iranian counterpart on the successful hosting of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Ministerial Conference, terming it a “significant milestone with far-reaching implications” for member states.
“We wish to benefit from each other’s experiences on internal security matters,” Naqvi said, extending an invitation to Momeni to visit Pakistan.
Accepting the invitation, Momeni said he would soon travel to Islamabad and also thanked Naqvi for Pakistan’s participation in the ECO conference.
Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu, senior officials from Iran’s interior ministry and diplomatic representatives were also present during the meetings.</p><small>2025-10-29 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291539146ff19a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951967/pakistan-calls-for-cessation-of-gaza-ceasefire-violations-after-israeli-strikes-kill-over-100' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations after Israeli strikes kill over 100</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday called for the immediate cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations by Israel after the latter’s strike on the Palestinian enclave killed more than 100 people.
Gaza’s health ministry said at least 104 people were killed after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory yesterday, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing a soldier, which the group denied.
The renewed Israeli bombardment prompted strong condemnation from Pakistan, one of the eight Muslim countries that worked with the United States on President Donald Trump’s peace plan.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, which have reportedly resulted in civilian casualties,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
 
 

“These actions constitute a clear and flagrant violation of international law, as well as a breach of the recently concluded peace agreement,” the FO said, warning that such “aggressive measures by the Israeli occupation forces threaten to undermine the international efforts aimed at establishing durable peace and stability in the region”.
“Pakistan calls upon the international community to ensure an immediate cessation of ceasefire violations by the Israeli occupation forces,” it added.
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s principled position for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine based on the pre-June 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital.
 






“At least 101 fatalities were brought to hospitals, including 35 children and a number of women and elderly, as a result of Israeli air strikes in less than 12 hours,” said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency.
“The Israeli strikes targeted tents for displaced people, homes and the vicinity of a hospital in the Strip,” Bassal told AFP. The agency’s toll was confirmed by an AFP tally of reports from medical officials at five Gaza hospitals that received the dead and wounded.
The territory’s main Al-Shifa hospital said one of the strikes hit its backyard.
Al-Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp.
“We had just started to breathe again, trying to rebuild our lives, when the bombardment came back,” said Khadija al-Husni, who lives in a tent at a school in the Al-Shati refugee camp.
“It’s a crime. Either there is a truce or a war — it can’t be both. The children couldn’t sleep; they thought the war was over.”
 


Gaza civil defence agency’s Bassal called the strikes “a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
However, Trump insisted that “nothing“ would jeopardise the truce he helped broker.
During a trip to Asia, the US president defended the actions of its longtime ally Israel, saying, “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back.”
The Israeli military said today it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire, claiming that “dozens of terror targets and terrorists were struck”.
It said its military forces and the Israel Security Agency, also known as Shin Bet, “struck 30 terrorists holding command positions” within fighter groups operating in Gaza.
Israel warns Hamas leadership will have no immunity
Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas leaders today that they would have no immunity after a wave of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, which Tel Aviv said was carried out in response to an attack on its troops.
“There will be no immunity for anyone in the leadership of the terrorist organisation Hamas — neither for those in suits nor for those hiding in tunnels,” Katz said, referring to several Hamas political leaders residing in Doha.
“Whoever raises a hand against an [Israeli] soldier, his hand will be severed. The [Israeli military] has been instructed to act decisively against every Hamas target and will continue to do so.”
 
 

Qatar has played a key mediating role in indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the outbreak of the war in October 2023, and is among the guarantors of the fragile peace deal, along with the US, Egypt, and Turkiye.
On September 9, Israel targeted Hamas negotiators in Doha, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack triggered widespread condemnation and drew a rebuke from Trump as well.
Weeks later, Israel and Hamas accepted a 20-point peace plan presented by Trump that called for the release of Gaza hostages and Palestinian prisoners, as well as a ceasefire after two years of deadly conflict.
Subsequently, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will head to Turkiye next week to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the Gaza peace plan to discuss the next steps.
Officials have said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force being assembled for Gaza. The reported chances of Islamabad doing so have raised questions among Pakistani politicians and journalists.</p><small>2025-10-29 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291408597426db1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951964/health-minister-saudi-counterpart-discuss-efforts-to-eradicate-polio' target='_blank'><strong>Health minister, Saudi counterpart discuss efforts to eradicate polio</strong></a><br><p>Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal and his Saudi counterpart Fahad Al-Jalajel held a discussion in Riyadh related to polio eradication from Pakistan, along with talks related to cooperation in the health sector and promotion of investment, the health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The meeting took place a day ago on the sidelines of the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh, where Kamal was part of a Pakistani delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Islamabad and Riyadh share long-standing diplomatic ties and, in recent years, have sought to expand and strengthen their partnership by adding greater strategic depth through enhanced cooperation in defence, economy, and health.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
“Both ministers held detailed discussions regarding polio eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” said the health ministry’s spokesperson, Sajjad Shah. “The upcoming polio eradication campaign was also discussed in the meeting.”
 






“Eliminating polio is one of the top priorities of the Government of Pakistan,” Kamal was quoted as saying by the spokesperson. “Under the leadership of the prime minister of Pakistan, steps are being taken to eradicate polio with complete unity.”
According to Kamal, the “historical and brotherly relations” between the two countries are built on strong foundations.
The health minister highlighted that so far, four national polio eradication campaigns have been successfully conducted during the year 2025, adding that the campaigns have ensured access to the vaccine for 45 million children.
“As a result of high-quality polio campaigns, cases have decreased significantly,” Kamal said. He, however, stressed that despite progress in the fight against polio, “the mission is not yet complete,” he added.
The Saudi delegation appreciated the steps taken by Pakistan to combat polio, per the ministry’s spokesperson. The delegation also assured of continued cooperation in combating polio in the future.
This year, at least 30 cases of the poliovirus have been reported across the country so far. In 2024, Pakistan reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-10-29 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291256391e8b2f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951954/supreme-court-tells-phc-to-decide-shibli-farazs-appeal-against-disqualification-as-senator' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court tells PHC to decide Shibli Faraz’s appeal against disqualification as senator</strong></a><br><p>A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to decide PTI leader Shibli Faraz’s appeal against his disqualification as a senator.
Faraz, along with former National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub, first approached the PHC. However, it had decided to adjourn sine die (for indefinite period) the pleas, directing the petitioners to first surrender before the competent court. Later, the PTI leaders challenged the high court’s decision before the SC.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a five-member CB resumed proceedings on Shibli’s appeal, after Ayub had withdrawn his during the last hearing on Monday. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad.
Faraz’s appeal challenges the PHC’s decision to indefinitely adjourn its hearings on his petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification de-seating him as the Senate opposition leader.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Faraz, while Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AAG) Aamir Rehman represented the state.
“We were removed by the election commission with great disgrace,” Gohar contended as the hearing began. He requested that a stay order be issued on the ECP notification removing his client as a member of the upper house of Parliament, thereby halting the by-election on the vacant seat.
 
 

Responding to Justice Rizvi’s question, Gohar replied that a by-election on just one Senate seat was to be held tomorrow. Justice Rizvi also wondered why Faraz was seeking a stay order on the by-election when the PTI had also nominated candidates.
Subsequently, the bench dismissed Gohar’s request, stating that it would not interfere in the by-election process.
A by-election to fill the general seat of the Senate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan and Irfan Saleem are contesting against PPP’s Nisar Khan and independent candidates Taj Mohammad Afridi and Abid Khan Yousafzai.
During the hearing, the ECP lawyer contended that convicts needed to surrender before a court prior to seeking any relief. Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case.
“We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case.
Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law.
At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?”
The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”.
Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.”
Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.”
After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition.
Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal.
PHC denies relief
On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution.
On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests.
The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them.
However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats.
 
 

The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications.
Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role.
Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.</p><small>2025-10-29 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291124164b00529.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951955/islamabad-court-upholds-arrest-warrant-for-gandapur-in-liquor-and-arms-case-over-persistent-no-shows' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court upholds arrest warrant for Gandapur in liquor and arms case over persistent no-shows</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Wednesday upheld a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur around a week ago over his continued absence from the hearings of a 2016 arms and liquor case.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025, Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025.
During today’s hearing, too, both Gandapur and his lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, failed to appear in court.
Subsequently, Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti upheld the court’s previous order and directed the relevant authorities to arrest and present Gandapur in the court.
The court adjourned the hearing till November 11.
Arms and liquor case
The case dates back to Oct 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on Nov 2.
Gandapur had denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the federal capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
During a previous hearing, Gandapur, while speaking to the media outside the courtroom, had dismissed the case as “politically motivated.”
“There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he had claimed.</p><small>2025-10-29 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29121050bea4e0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina warns of mass voter boycott as her party barred from election</strong></a><br><p>Millions of supporters of Bangladesh’s Awami League will boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls, ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters on Wednesday from her exile in New Delhi.
Hasina, 78, said she would not return to Bangladesh under any government formed after elections that exclude her party, and plans to remain in India, where she fled in August 2024 following a deadly student-led uprising.
An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February.
“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters.
“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.”
Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest
Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote.
The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders.
“We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.”
She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls.
 
 

Separately, in comments to AFP, Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country.
Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile.
The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.
According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.
Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13.
 
 

Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes.
“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.”
While, in written responses to AFP, Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke”
No plans to return home yet
Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it.
Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked.
“It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“
Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history.
A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her.
“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said.
Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform.
‘Open fire on crowds’
Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC.
“The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP, although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”.
“But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.”
The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters.
Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”.
She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “Operation Devil Hunt”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country.
 
 

At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule.
Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”.
This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement.
As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”</p><small>2025-10-29 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291010083deda55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951950/trump-says-nothing-will-jeopardise-gaza-ceasefire-after-israeli-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says ‘nothing’ will jeopardise Gaza ceasefire after Israeli strikes</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory accusing Hamas of violating the truce, which the group denied.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 50 people, including 22 children, and wounded around 200.
“At least 50 killed, including 22 children and a number of women and children, as a result of the ongoing Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last night,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency, told AFP.
Around 200 people were wounded “in a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”, he said, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic and terrifying”.
Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce.
“They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia.
US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”.
“We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …
but I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said.

Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful strikes” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave.
While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire.
The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza.
Escalations
Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard.
Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp.
Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”.
 


A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement.
Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins.
Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over.
‘Act decisively’
Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.
Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10.
But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office.
Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains.
“Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …
inside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages.
‘We want to rest’
On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again.
“Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said.
“We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable.
“The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP.
The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal.

Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry.
Despite the ceasefire, the toll has continued to climb as more bodies are found under the rubble.</p><small>2025-10-29 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29110542060914b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951952/250m-approved-for-glacial-melt-adaptation-programme-in-9-countries-including-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>$250m approved for glacial melt adaptation programme in 9 countries, including Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF)  has approved $250 million for a flagship adaptation programme aimed at building resilient water and agriculture systems for vulnerable communities in the glacier-dependent regions of Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and Pakistan, a press release issued on Wednesday said.
Led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the ‘Glaciers to Farms’ programme covers nine ADB developing member countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, which all rely on glacier and snow-fed rivers for agriculture, domestic water, and electricity generation.
The programme will focus on four glacier-fed river basins — the Naryn and Pyanj in Central Asia, the Kura in the South Caucasus, and the Swat in Pakistan — covering roughly 27m hectares, the ADB said in a press release.
The handout added that the GCF approved its concessional funding for the programme at its 43rd board meeting on October 29.
It said that around 13m people, including farmers and vulnerable populations in fragile mountain regions, would benefit directly from the programme, adding that it would support climate and glacier assessments that would inform national development plans and investment pipelines.
The programme will also strengthen monitoring and early warning systems to help communities manage the impacts of hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and prolonged droughts, the handout said.
It stated that accelerated glacial melt threatened ecosystem services and livelihoods, presenting a serious challenge in the aforementioned countries, where about one in four jobs are in agriculture.
GCF’s funding will be provided mostly as grants and invested alongside $3.25 billion from ADB over the next decade in a series of projects identified by the countries covered by the programme, it added.
By investing in efficient irrigation, water storage, and watershed management, the projects will help improve agricultural productivity even as accelerated glacial melt increases the frequency of droughts or floods, the handout said.
“Rapid glacial retreat is one of the most complex development challenges faced by our region,” ADB Director for Agriculture, Food, Nature, and Rural Development Yasmin Siddiqi was quoted as saying in the press release.
“We need practical, scalable, and science-based solutions to help communities adapt. With catalytic support from GCF, ‘Glaciers to Farms’ will help move the region beyond fragmented projects and towards systemic, long-term resilience that protects lives and livelihoods now and for future generations,“ she added.
GCF Director of Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Middle East Region Department Thomas Eriksson said that the programme was the “kind of large-scale, innovative, and collaborative effort that will help countries in Central and West Asia strengthen adaptation planning and cooperation to manage climate impacts on glacier-fed water systems”.
“This programme sets a transformative benchmark by improving data, coordination, and financing readiness for long-term resilience in the region’s water and food systems,“ he said.</p><small>2025-10-29 06:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29110837dd73215.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951953/china-india-had-active-communication-over-border-control' target='_blank'><strong>China, India had ‘active’ communication over border control</strong></a><br><p>The Chinese and Indian militaries have had talks on the management of the border the countries share, and both agreed to use existing mechanisms to resolve any “ground issues”, the neighbours said on Wednesday.
New Delhi and Beijing had reached a milestone pact last year on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed.
Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows.
China’s defence ministry said that in the latest round of high-level military talks held on the Indian side of a meeting point on Saturday, the neighbours agreed to continue their dialogue through military and diplomatic channels.
“Both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc.

After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital.
In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said.
“Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said.
The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan.
“In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said.
He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”.
He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue.
“Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists.
“Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said.
“The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said.
The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”.
“The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedalled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul.
“Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he said.
“I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedalled from the deal.”
“I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added.
The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Pakistan.
“India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”
When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.
“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists.”
“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.
Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks
On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”.
A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”.
From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”.
However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement.
“The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening.
Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.”
The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost was cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said.
Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue.
Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”</p><small>2025-10-29 05:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29072548651b10d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951908/after-another-denied-meeting-imran-tells-kp-cm-to-pick-his-team' target='_blank'><strong>After another ‘denied meeting’, Imran tells KP CM to pick his team</strong></a><br><p>• Uzma says PTI founder has given Sohail Afridi complete authority to pick ‘a small team’
• CM vows to file contempt plea over Adiala jail restrictions
• KP opposition says absence of cabinet impacting govt affairs
ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR: After Khyber Pakhtu­n­k­h­wa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was once again barred from meeting his incarcerated party founder, Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
On Tuesday, CM Afridi arrived in Rawalpindi for a third time to meet Imran Khan in the Adiala jail, ostensibly to discuss the KP cabinet formation. However, he was not allowed to meet the party chief despite court orders in this regard.
Meanwhile, KP opposition members in the provincial assembly criticised  the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Last week, CM Afridi was denied the meeting and held a brief sit-in before returning empty-handed. This time, he said he’d move a contempt of court petition to contest the restrictions.
Speaking to media persons outside the prison, CM Afridi said he would file a contempt plea in the Islamabad High Court. He said it was his constitutional right to meet the PTI founder, as he was nominated by Imran Khan and was the representative of the people of KP.
He reiterated that he wanted to seek guidance from the party founder regarding the composition of the provincial cabinet and vowed to nominate ministers after meeting with Mr Khan.
However, Uzma Khanum, who was allowed to meet her brother on Monday, told reporters that Mr Khan wanted Sohail Afridi to go ahead with cabinet formation.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala, Ms Khanum said she had a message for the KP CM, since he could not meet the former premier.
“The CM should form a cabinet of his choice and as per the need of the hour,” the PTI founder was quoted as saying by his sister.
The message called on CM Afridi to “pick a small team”, while Ms Khanum said her brother had not proposed any names for inclusion in the provincial cabinet.
She said Imran Khan had also expressed concerns over the delay in the notification of Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the National Assembly opposition leader. She clarified that only party secretary Salman Akram Raja was empowered to relay messages to the party on Mr Khan’s behalf, to avoid confusion.
Deployment of troops in Gaza
Meanwhile, the PTI demanded clarification from the federal government regarding reports of the proposed deployment of Pakistani troops in Gaza. “The decision to send Pakistan’s armed forces to Gaza is an extremely sensitive national matter which must only be made through transparent consultation and with broad national consensus,” the party said, asking the government to take parliament, the political leadership, and the nation into confidence.

At a Monday event in Islamabad, the tech company said it was expanding its artificial intelligence language capabilities to better serve users in Pakistan who wished to interact with AI in Urdu. The announcement was both exciting and unsettling. “The introduction of Urdu for Meta AI is a milestone in making technology more inclusive and accessible for our people, ensuring that no one is left behind in our digital transformation,” the federal IT minister said on the occasion. While the intent should be appreciated, we must also worry whether there has been enough discourse in Urdu regarding the dangers and shortcomings of AI and how users must protect against them.
There is no denying that AI models that are accessible in ordinary users’ mother tongues can open up whole new worlds of possibilities in a society like Pakistan, where social inequalities often limit who gets to benefit from modern advances and who gets left behind. Technology has always been a great leveller: each innovation has enabled humans to further their individual potential. AI is incredibly more potent than any other technology in this regard because it allows users to connect and engage with it at a very human level. However, as has already been seen, AI has brought with it its own set of dangers. Misuse of AI has already created major challenges, especially in the form of the increased spread of misinformation and disinformation. As it is introduced to new categories of users, there is a risk of contagion, and without adequate safeguards in place, this could create major problems. Therefore, it is hoped that as much effort will be put into educating users who will be interacting with AI in Urdu as has been done for English speakers. They must not be exposed to its many risks unprepared.

In the remote village of Kolahu, tucked away in the dusty hills of Tump in Balochistan’s Kech district bordering Iran, darkness was a constant — precluding the hum of a fan, the promise of refrigerated medicine and the safety of a well-lit room. A scorpion’s sting in the night was a crisis met only by the dim, choking flame of a kerosene lamp. From the school in the village to the dispensary nearby, none had power.
This changed a few months ago, when a truck with unfamiliar tools and a curious, maintenance-free battery — the key components of a home solar system, provided under a new scheme by Balochistan’s energy department. Nako was one of 40 people in his village to receive the “home solar solution.”
LET THERE BE LIGHT…
In the vast, sun-scorched expanse of Balochistan — Pakistan’s largest yet most energy-deprived province — a connection to the national power grid is a rarity. Official reports suggest that only about a third of the region is linked, and even those areas suffer from erratic supply. 
It is in this void that a transformative force is taking hold, delivered through a grant aid initiative from China. Born from a collaboration with the provincial energy department and China, the programme intends to deliver 15,000 home solar systems to the province’s remote corners. Each kit is a self-contained power source: a 250-watt panel, a charge controller and, most critically, a compact lithium-ion battery — the same technology that powers electric scooters in Karachi and laptops in Lahore.

Lithium-ion batteries, mostly made in China, are electrifying homes and powering dreams,
  including in the remote corners of Balochistan — an energy revolution in the making. 
  But without local manufacturing or disposal mechanisms, they also raise questions…

For Nako, the technical jargon was meaningless. He knew nothing of “lithium-ion” or the “Guangdong” province stamped on the battery casing. His understanding was beautifully simple: a panel that drank the sunlight, a box that held the day’s energy and the profound promise that, by evening, his one-room mud-brick home would have power enough for two steady lights and the gentle hum of a fan — a small piece of the modern world.
SCALE OF THE REVOLUTION
Nako’s small system is a single data point in a national surge. 
According to global trade data platform Volza, Pakistan imported almost 70 percent of its lithium-ion batteries from China between April 2024 to March 2025, with the rest coming from the US and Vietnam. 
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), in its June 2025 report Battery storage and the future of Pakistan’s electricity grid, reveals that lithium-ion batteries import in 2024 in the country totalled around 1.25 gigawatt-hours (GWh) and, additionally, 400 megawatt-hours (MWh) in the first two months of 2025. The IEEFA report adds this could increase to 8.75 GWh, or 26 percent of the projected peak demand in 2030, “if business as usual persists.”
This demand is set to explode further. Pakistan’s nascent Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy 2020-2025 envisages turning 30 percent of all vehicles into EVs by 2030. With leading manufacturers such as China’s BYD planning local assembly by 2026, the competition for a limited supply of batteries will intensify.
THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE
For now, importing batteries from China is a blessing, but there is a cost to this convenience. This dependency rests on a fragile foundation. While there have been announcements regarding plants to be set up, to date, the country has no local lithium mining, no cell production capabilities and no infrastructure to recycle e-waste. 
“If there is a shift in export policy by Beijing, a shipping issue or a geopolitical service cut-off, Pakistan won’t have any alternative supplier,” warns Asumi Heibitan, an electrical engineer at the University of Turbat.
Beyond trade risks, Heibitan points to a pressing issue of equity. A 5-kWh lithium-ion solar system can cost more than Rs200,000 — making it unaffordable for most low-income households. “Schemes such as the one rolled out by Balochistan’s energy department make a difference, but many marginalised communities remain excluded to-date,” he adds.
A LOOMING WASTE CRISIS
That’s not where the problems end. Pakistan currently has no formal lithium-ion recycling capacity. This means end-of-life batteries — typically containing poisonous metals such as cobalt, manganese, nickel and lithium salts — will end up in waste sites, contaminating soil and water. Without a policy for lithium waste, Pakistan risks becoming a dumping ground for its own green energy transition.
Entities such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and the International Energy Agency have identified the inherent risks in recycling lithium-ion batteries. According to them, improper handling of lithium-ion batteries at recycling facilities can lead to “thermal runaway”, a dangerous process where damaged batteries — whether from crushing, puncturing or overheating — can short-circuit internally, causing fires and explosions, while also releasing toxic gases such as hydrogen fluoride.
Compounding these dangers, the global recycling infrastructure is vastly underprepared. According to a Forbes estimate, only five percent of lithium-ion batteries are currently recycled. With demand projected to rise by 30 percent, a growing tidal wave of end-of-life batteries will exacerbate the existing safety and environmental crises, overwhelming a system that is already failing.
It does not help that technical universities, such as the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore or the NED University in Karachi, offer no specialised courses on battery recycling and management. This educational gap ensures continued reliance on foreign consultants for large-scale projects.
Though geological surveys suggest possible lithium deposits in Chagai and Gilgit-Baltistan, this potential is fragile. Chinese extraction models, local rights and environmental safety concerns present significant hurdles before Pakistan can transition from a consumer to a contributor.
The continued import of Chinese-made batteries, thus, raises critical policy questions. Should the country rely on imported green tech or start building its own local capacity? What happens when tens of thousands of these batteries pile up on garbage heaps with no disposal plan?
Our neighbours are already answering these questions. India is heavily investing in local battery production and has enacted the Battery Waste Management Rule of 2022. Bangladesh and even Rwanda are launching pilot production projects, while Pakistan remains stuck in an import-only paradigm.
A safer future requires coordinated action. The government must encourage local assembly through tax incentives and training. Agreements with China should evolve beyond trade to include joint technology development in SEZs. Critically, authorities must start mapping nationwide battery installations to forecast and manage the coming wave of waste. Public education on safety and quality is essential, as is diversifying import sources to avoid supply shocks.
THE PRICE OF LIGHT
Back in Tump, the days are getting hotter. Nako Dost Muhammad proudly tells visitors that he no longer fears the nights. His grandson can study after dark and his wife doesn’t need to cook before dusk.
But a new fear about the battery has started. A teacher in the village told Nako these batteries can catch fire in extreme heat. He wonders how long the box with Chinese letters will last, as he received no receipt, no warranty and no way to replace it.
For now, the lithium in his battery has travelled a long way — from a mine in Chile, to a factory in Guangdong, to the Karachi port and, finally, on a bumpy road to a village long forgotten by the national grid.
Lithium-ion batteries are a good fit for a country with an unreliable grid and green ambitions. But the way Pakistan is using them now — only importing, with no plan for local industry or waste — is a real risk. 
We must decide whether we will only be consumers of foreign technology, or a country that localises, manages and innovates its own green solutions.
