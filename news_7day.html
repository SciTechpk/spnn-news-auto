This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a report dated October 16, which was made public on December 15. The report outlined India‘s military response to the Pahalgam attack, as well as New Delhi’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” following the incident.
The five UN experts who compiled the report also observed that New Delhi’s actions that “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty” appeared to risk violating the rights to work and livelihood, an adequate standard of living — including the rights to water and food — a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and development.
The attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the IWT in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
UN special rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as an independent on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order discussed these events in detail in their October report.
‘Unlawful use of force’
The UN experts noted that while India maintained it had exercised its “right to respond and preempt, as well as deter … cross-border attacks” by lauching strikes in Pakistan, New Delhi “did not notify the UN Security Council that its operation was in the exercise to of the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, under the procedures required by that article“.
They emphasised that Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law “prohibits India from the threat or use of armed force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Pakistan, whether such force is targeting state or non-state actors”.
“We note further that under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and customary international law, India may only exercise the right of self-defence in foreign territory where it is necessary and proportionate in response to an armed attack committed by a foreign state, whether directly by state forces or where a state ‘sends’ non-state forces to attack,” they added.
The experts further highlighted that Article 51 required “the victim state“ to report the armed attack to the Security Council.
“There is no separate right to unilaterally use military force in foreign territory in order to counter terrorism.”
The experts also said, “We are concerned that India has not disclosed credible evidence that the militants who committed the Pahalgam attack were sent to attack India by the Government of Pakistan.”
Reiterating that India had not notified the Security Council of any claim of self-defence in carrying out strikes in Pakistan, they experts observed: “It appears that India has violated the prohibition on the use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and may itself have committed an armed attack on Pakistan, entitling Pakistan to exercise self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter, risking escalation that could pose grave danger to life in both states.”
“The unlawful use of force would consequently constitute a violation of the right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights),“ the experts said.
They further noted that “the illegal use of force on foreign territory would also constitute a violation of the foreign state’s sovereignty and the duty of non-intervention in a foreign state”.
‘Abeyance’ of IWT
Discussing the “abeyance” of IWT by India in a unilateral action, the UN experts highlighted its significance for Pakistan.
They noted that rivers irrigate 18 million hectares of farmland in the country (about 80 percent of Pakistan’s arable land), particularly in the food bowl provinces of Punjab and Sindh, contributing 24 per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product.
“The rivers are thus vital in providing food security and livelihoods within Pakistan’s population of 240 million people. Limited water storage in Pakistan means that it relies on the unimpeded flow of river water.
“Any disruption of the flow of water under the Indus Waters Treaty (such as by filling large pondage pools and reservoirs, opening dam gates to flood downstream, or the mass release of sediment) could have serious impacts onistan, human rights in Pak including the right to work and livelihood, the right to an adequate standard of living (including the right to water and the right to food), the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and the right to development,” they said.
The experts further stated that Pakistan was “already a water-stressed country and is one of the ten countries most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including water scarcity”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also mentioned the findings of the report with regard to the IWT when addressing the diplomatic corps in Islamabad on Friday.

According to Khaleej Times, a period of low-pressure systems in the Middle East has brought heavy rainfall over the last week. Conditions were forecast to intensify on Thursday, with thunderstorms expected to hit the region.
The storm was then forecast to move eastwards towards the UAE and Qatar by night, it added, citing BBC Weather.
Khaleej Times reported that large areas of Qatar had also been covered by snowfall already, sharing a video of the landscape.

In Saudi Arabia, snow and light rainfall were experienced in Trojena, a mountain destination for hiking and skiing located on Jebel Al-Lawz in the province of Tabuk that reaches up to 2,600 metres, according to Arab News.
Additionally, light to moderate rain was experienced in Bir Bin Hermas, Al-Ayinah, Ammar, Al-Ula Governorate and Shaqra and its suburbs. Several other regions, including Riyadh, also experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, the outlet added.
Riyadh experienced thick cloud cover and rainfall from early yesterday. According to Arab News, all schools in the Saudi capital switched to remote learning amid the continuing inclement weather.
“The Qassim Region, including the city of Buraidah, experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, while Tabuk Region experienced light to moderate rainfall on Thursday,” it said, citing the Saudi Press Agency (SPA).
“Parts of Hail region also witnessed snowfall on Wednesday evening in areas surrounding the city of Hail, while light to moderate rainfall was reported across the region and several of its governorates.”
The outlet added that according to the SPA, the National Centre for Meteorology (NCM) anticipated more snow in the northern parts of the Riyadh region and the governorates of Al-Majmaah and Al-Ghat, north of Riyadh, which witnessed snowfall on Thursday morning that led to accumulations over highland and open areas.

 

The official spokesperson for the NCM, Hussein Al-Qahtani, explained that the weather conditions affecting the north of the region were caused by a cold mass of air advancing into the area, accompanied by rain-bearing clouds. This contributed to temperatures dropping below zero degrees Celsius in some locations.
“Al-Qahtani noted that the centre had issued early warnings regarding the weather conditions, adding that specialised teams continued to monitor developments,” Arab News said, adding that the spokesperson expected temperatures to remain low over the coming hours with a chance of frost in several northern and central areas.
He urged citizens and residents to exercise caution, particularly while driving on exposed roads, due to the potential formation of ice.
“He also stressed the importance of following official weather updates issued by the centre through its official channels, while adhering to preventive guidelines and avoiding open areas during peak cold periods to ensure public safety,” the agency said.
Reactions to unprecedented snowfall
Many people gathered to witness the snowfall in Al-Majmaah and Al-Ghat.
Thamr Alotaibi, a Riyadh resident, told Arab News, “This is unprecedented, so we are excited to see it. Me and my friends are going to experience this winter wonder which is going to be an amazing experience.”
Meanwhile, due to gusty and dust-stirring winds, the General Directorate of Civil Defence called for caution and adherence to guidelines in light of the inclement weather conditions.
“It has advised residents to avoid going to valleys during this spell of weather,” the outlet said.
Riyadh resident Abdul Hammed told Arab News: “We had an outing planned for a family get-together at a banquet on the city’s outskirts but the prevailing weather has forced us to change the plan, and we have decided to remain indoors instead.”
Experts say snowfall not unusual
Against this backdrop, a leading Saudi astronomer said such snowfall events are not unusual during the winter months, Gulf News reported.
Mohammed bin Reddah Al Thaqafi, an astronomer and expert at the Taif Astronomical Sundial and a member of the Arab Union for Space and Astronomy Sciences, said that snowfall in northern Saudi Arabia occurs periodically each winter, even though it does not follow a fixed astronomical cycle.
Its recurrence depends largely on shifting climatic and atmospheric conditions, he explained, according to the agency.
He added that snowfall was typically recorded between December and February and was most common in regions such as Tabuk, Al-Jouf and Arar, which are more exposed to Mediterranean weather systems than other parts of the kingdom.
“He identified areas including Jabal Al Lawz, Alaqan and Al Dhahr in Tabuk; Sakaka and Dumat Al Jandal in Al Jouf; Arar in the Northern Borders; Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma in Hail; and the highlands of Abha in Asir as the locations most likely to experience snowfall,” Gulf News said.
While some seasons pass without snow, the expert noted that these areas remain among the most reliable destinations for winter conditions, the agency added.
Al Thaqafi urged motorists and outdoor visitors to exercise caution in the snow, warning of slippery roads and reduced visibility, and stressed the importance of adhering to traffic regulations to avoid accidents, it said.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19110316b25ab1c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960496/algorithmic-crowd-the-changing-anatomy-of-mobs-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Algorithmic crowd: The changing anatomy of mobs in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>For decades, public mobilisation followed a predictable path in Pakistan: political parties issued calls, clerics announced processions, and unions organised marches. The police relied on this structure for years — negotiating with leaders, planning routes, and anticipating escalation based on past patterns.
But crowds across the country no longer mobilise the way our institutions imagine them. That world is gone.
Today’s crowd forms inside a smartphone long before it appears on the street. A short video, an edited clip, a voice note, or a rumour forwarded through WhatsApp can spark movement faster than any political directive.
TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have become Pakistan’s real mobilisation engines. Their algorithms reward emotionally charged content — anger, outrage, victimhood, religious sentiment — and rapidly push it to millions.
When virality becomes a security threat
Having commanded almost 11,861 public order operations in Lahore — including political protests, religious marches, Muharram and Ashura processions, and Independence Day crowds — one reality has become increasingly clear: the crowd forms digitally before it forms physically. By the time the first police unit arrives at a disturbance, the emotional ignition has already occurred online.
This is not traditional mobilisation. This is algorithmic mobilisation.
A telling example is the fabricated rape alert that circulated among students of the Punjab College for Women last year. It went instantly viral, triggering the mobilisation of thousands in major cities across the province.
In another instance, in October 2025, a pro-Palestine protest near Lahore’s Press Club initially remained peaceful before turning violent following the spread of incendiary content and live clips online. What happened next was triggered by an algorithm-driven surge.
A crowd of hundreds and thousands attempted to target a sensitive building, creating a high-risk security situation. The protest was brought under control through rapid containment, controlled use of force, leadership isolation and engagement with organisers. Subsequently, critical infrastructure was secured.
Mobilisation, when it is religious, becomes even more rapid and volatile — a short sermon, a recycled clip, a video cunningly cropped to imply blasphemy. They travel at the speed of light. In several instances, painstaking negotiations built over days collapsed the moment such a clip began circulating, triggering spontaneous gatherings far beyond the anticipated scale.

 

Muharram and other religious events now unfold alongside a parallel digital arena that is often more combustible than the physical procession itself. During a Chehlum procession in 2024, a brief sectarian altercation occurred at Pir Makki Cut after a small group violated pre-approved procession routes. An unauthorised crossing led to verbal provocation and a minor physical confrontation.
However, context-stripped videos of the incident were rapidly amplified online, inflating the perceived threat far beyond the ground reality and creating the risk of wider mobilisation. The situation was ultimately contained through immediate physical separation, strict route enforcement, and negotiations with local Shia and Sunni elders, preventing an algorithm-driven digital escalation from translating into street-level disorder.
And Independence Day in Lahore revealed a new phenomenon altogether: performative disorder. Large groups (mostly young) were not motivated by politics or grievance but by visibility. Their behaviour was shaped by the possibility of going viral. Livestreams encouraged risk-taking, aggression and harassment.
Despite these shifts, Pakistan’s policing model remains rooted in assumptions that no longer hold.
Managing viral mobilisation beyond force
We still prepare for events by focusing on the number of participants, the political leadership involved, and the route. But algorithmic crowds do not follow leaders, do not mobilise gradually, and do not behave predictably. Their motivation is shaped less by ideology and more by emotion — and emotion today is engineered by digital platforms.
Simply put, our public order challenges now begin online.
If Pakistan is to manage these rapidly changing patterns of mobilisation, it must adopt a digital-first approach to public safety, which includes establishing specialised units dedicated to monitoring real-time digital sentiment, identifying viral triggers, and tracking the spread of provocative content. Safe City authorities, telecom regulators, and intelligence agencies must work together to create a unified operational picture that combines online signals with on-ground indicators.
This shift is already occurring, but primarily through a law-and-order lens. Punjab is moving to legislate a dedicated Riot Management Unit (RMU) under the Police Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2025, aimed at responding to “unlawful” protests and mobs through specialised training and equipment.

 

The proposed law would empower authorities to declare riot zones, cordon off areas, evacuate civilians, and provide legal cover to RMU personnel acting “in good faith”. It also seeks to hold protest organisers and instigators financially liable for damage to life and property, while expanding punitive reach through harsher penalties, including up to 10 years’ imprisonment and heavy fines for violence or vandalism during protests.
Yet, enforcement alone cannot keep pace with digitally driven mobilisation. Equally important is the use of predictive analytics and heat maps — tools that can detect when online anger is clustering around specific locations, identities, or events.
Standard operating procedures must be updated to treat digital triggers as early warning signals, not background noise. Public order units must be capable of responding within minutes, not hours, before misinformation hardens into mass mobilisation. This urgency exists within a broader security environment where the state is under constant pressure to demonstrate control.
Evolving beyond batons
Pakistan’s repeated calls for neighbouring countries to address cross-border terror concerns, alongside domestic incidents such as the killing of a key murder suspect during an Abbottabad operation, reflect an institutional climate where decisiveness is prioritised amid volatility. In such a setting, public order management risks becoming reactive and force-centric unless it is recalibrated for the digital age.
None of this means restricting speech or policing dissent. It means recognising that public order today is shaped by forces operating far faster than conventional intelligence systems were designed to handle. When a video travels faster than verification, and outrage spreads faster than reason, policing must evolve beyond batons, barricades, and after-action reports.

 

Pakistan is entering a period where crowds will form faster, disperse faster, and act more unpredictably than ever before. If institutions fail to adapt, the next major crisis will not begin with a political announcement or a religious sermon, but with a 12-second clip circulating on a platform engineered to reward emotion.
To preserve public safety, the state must begin by accepting a simple truth: the crowd now begins in the feed, not on the street.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191251041b5c2c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962016/dar-sounds-alarm-over-indias-weaponisation-of-water-following-variations-in-chenab-flow' target='_blank'><strong>Dar sounds alarm over India’s ‘weaponisation of water’ following variations in Chenab flow</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday sounded the alarm over India’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River, which have caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
He made the remarks while addressing an urgent media briefing for the diplomatic corps in Islamabad, a day after the Foreign Office said it had sought a clarification from India via a letter over the sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow.







At the beginning of his briefing, Dar said he wished to draw attention to a situation that threatened peace and stability in South Asia.
“We witnessed in April this year India’s unilateral abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) … But what we are witnessing now is material breaches by India that strike at the heart of the IWT with escalating consequences for regional stability and sanctity of international law,” he said.
“We have observed unusual, abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River twice this year,” he said, adding that these were observed from April 30 to May 21 and from Dec 7 to Dec 15.
“These variations in water flow are of extreme concern to Pakistan as they point to the unilateral release of water by India into the Chenab River. India has released this water without any prior notification or any data or information sharing with Pakistan as required under the treaty,” he said.
“India’s manipulation of water has prompted our Indus water commissioner to write a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matter as provided in the IWT,” he said.
He further said that India’s most recent action “clearly exemplifies the weaponisation of water to which Pakistan has been consistently drawing attention of the international community”.
“India’s manipulation of water at a critical time of our agricultural cycle directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as the food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
Dar said that Pakistan expected India to respond to the queries raised by the country’s Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flows, and fulfil all its obligations in letter and spirit under the IWT provisions.
“Recent violations of the treaty by India are just one example. India has consistently attempted to undermine the treaty in a systemic manner,” he said.
The deputy prime minister said that India‘s construction of hydropower projects such as Kishanganga and Ratle involved design features that violated the treaty’s technical specifications.
“India continues to build illegal dams in sheer disregard of the treaty obligations to impose fait accompli. With the building of dams, Indian capacity to store and manipulate water is also increasing which endangers Pakistan’s security, economy, and the livelihood of 240 million people,” he said.
Dar said India had halted sharing information, hydrological data, and joint oversight required by the treaty, which had exposed Pakistan to floods and droughts.
“Such illegal and irresponsible Indian conduct has all the potential to trigger a humanitarian crisis in Pakistan,“ he asserted, adding that ongoing water manipulation by India was in violation of international and humanitarian law.
“If India is allowed to violate the treaty and obligations under the treaty with impunity, we are setting a very dangerous precedent,“ he said. Dar further said that India was also subverting the treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism by refusing to participate in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and neutral expert proceedings.
“India is pursuing a deliberate strategy to sabotage a well-established arbitration process under the treaty provisions. Pakistan would like to reiterate that the IWT is a binding legal instrument that has made an invaluable contribution to the peace and stability of South Asia,” he said.
He said that violating the treaty threatened the inviolability of international treaties and also posed serious threats to regional peace and security. He noted that PCA had recently reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute resolution mechanisms.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
“These rulings leave no ambiguity that the IWT is alive and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he said, calling on the international community to reject “Indian impunity“.
He also talked about a report by UN rapporteurs, saying that they had also expressed concern regarding India’s actions in connection with the IWT. Dar noted that the report was made public on December 15.
“As per the report, on June 21, India’s home minister declared that India would never restore the treaty and would instead divert to India’s Rajasthan via a new canal,” he said.
He went on to say that the same report said that on April 21, Pakistan’s national security committee declared that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water to Pakistan under the treaty will be considered as an act of war”.
On the matter of holding the IWT in abeyance, Dar said that the report observed that the action risked affecting the “human rights of millions of people in Pakistan”.
Dar once again called on the international community to take notice of India’s “continued disregard” of a bilateral treaty and counsel India to act “responsibly”.
The minister also took note of “belligerent statements” from Indian leadership, which he said demonstrated India’s “intentions, designs to weaponise water aimed at inflicting harm to Pakistan and its people”.
“We have repeatedly brought the situation to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC),” he said. He said that he had also written to the UN secretary general and the president of the UN General Assembly to play their “due role” in the matter.
Dar once again reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes with India; however, he warned that Pakistan “will not compromise on the existential water rights of its people”.
As the minister concluded his address, he urged the international community, particularly UNSC members, “to take immediate steps to address this situation”.
He expressed optimism that the international community, in its capacity, will call on India to “restore the IWT in full, stop the weaponisation of water, uphold international law and treaty obligations and refrain from undermining the peace and stability of South Asia”.
“Water is life, and it can not be weaponised,” Dar concluded.
According to daily reports of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks on the Chenab River was found to be alarming from Dec 9 to Dec 18.
The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on Dec 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on Dec 10.
India had held the IWT in abeyance in April following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191000224809199.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962009/4-militants-killed-as-security-forces-camp-comes-under-attack-in-north-waziristans-boya' target='_blank'><strong>4 militants killed as security forces’ camp comes under attack in North Waziristan’s Boya</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists were killed after they attacked the battalion headquarters of security forces in the Boya area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district on Friday, security sources said.
The sources identified the terrorists as those belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij, a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
One of the “suicide bombers” among the terrorists rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a wall of the Boya fort on Friday morning, causing a blast, the sources said.
The powerful blast was heard as far as Miranshah city, located nearly 25 kilometres away, local sources reported.
Around four to five terrorists attempted to enter the fort after the blast, but the attempt was foiled due to timely action by security personnel, security sources said, adding that three terrorists were killed on the spot as a result of the action.
The sources said there were reports that security personnel had encircled one of the remaining terrorists, and an operation was currently under way.
According to them, only the outer wall of the battalion headquarters was partially damaged in the attack.
Initially, police had reported that assailants managed to enter the premises and opened fire. In the ensuing exchange of fire, four militants were killed while four security personnel sustained injuries, police earlier said.
Soon after the explosion, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a clearance operation.
A heavy contingent of police and security personnel reached the site, while special teams of the bomb disposal squad were dispatched to examine the scene.
Rescue 1122 and medical teams were also engaged in relief and rescue operations. Authorities said evidence was being collected from the site as investigations were under way
Following the attack, security across the district was placed on high alert, and traffic on a key highway was temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure.
The incident comes two months after four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali.
State media reported at the time that one terrorist rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more tried to enter it.
Friday’s incident comes as a spate of terrorist attacks continues in Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191221530d8d609.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962020/australias-head-slams-unbeaten-142-to-crush-englands-ashes-hopes' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Head slams unbeaten 142 to crush England’s Ashes hopes</strong></a><br><p>Danger man Travis Head crunched his fourth century in as many Tests at Adelaide Oval Friday as Australia built a 356-run lead over England to stand on the brink of retaining the Ashes.
The hosts were 271-4 at stumps on day three of the third Test with Head on 142 and first-innings century-maker Alex Carey not out 52, taking the five-match series out of England’s reach.
England must win after crashing inside two days at the first Test in Perth and inside four in Brisbane, both by eight wickets.
But it appears to be an impossible task with the highest run chase at the ground 316 by Australia against England in 1902.







Head’s crucial ton, his 11th, came off a composed 146 balls although he almost didn’t get there, dropped on 99 by Harry Brook as impatience got the better of him.
He has now scored a century in four consecutive Tests on his home ground, following 140 against India last year and 119 and 175 against the West Indies.
Australia suffered an early setback in a tense 20 minutes before lunch after England were all out for 286 on the back of Ben Stokes’ gritty 83 in response to Australia’s first innings 371.
Bryson Carse trapped Jake Weatherald lbw for one and he walked without reviewing after the umpire lifted his finger, although replays showed the ball was pitching outside leg stump.
It gave England a glimmer of hope, but after the break Head slammed the door shut, cutting and chopping boundaries to all corners of the ground.
Marnus Labuschagne went for 13 when he edged Josh Tongue to Harry Brook at slip, with reviews showing it carried.
Usman Khawaja, who hit a defiant 82 in the first innings after his last-minute call-up for the ill Steve Smith, was a perfect foil for the more aggressive Head.
But on 40 he was undone by the spin of Will Jacks, caught behind, and Cameron Green followed soon after for seven, edging Tongue to Brook.
After getting through the nervous 90s, Head finally brought up his century with a four off Joe Root, taking off his helmet and kissing the turf before pumping his fists.
While not in the same vein as his match-winning 69-ball century in Perth, it was a critical knock, supported by Carey and aided by Stokes not bowling after his exploits with the bat.
Gutsy Stokes
After a woeful batting display on Thursday, Stokes and Jofra Archer kept England’s dreams alive with a stirring 106-run ninth-wicket stand.
They resumed at 213-8 in muggy conditions with Stokes not out 45 and Archer on 30.
Stokes, who suffered leg cramps and dehydration during his gutsy rearguard action in sweltering 40 Celsius heat on Thursday, brought up his slowest ever 50 in Tests, off 159 balls.

He kept plugging away but finally fell when Mitchell Starc took the new ball and bowled him, with Stokes one of the few players who showed the fight he had demanded before the game.
Archer was another, ably helping his captain.
The fast bowler was the last man out when caught by Labuschagne off Scott Boland for 51 — his highest Test score and a maiden half-century Boland ended with 3-45 while Pat Cummins took 3-69 in his first Test since July.
England’s woes began when openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, along with the under-performing Ollie Pope, departed in a 15-ball blitz on Thursday at the hands of Cummins and Nathan Lyon.

“At president Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to pause the DV1 programme to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme,“ she said.







According to the Associated Press, the diversity visa programme makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the US, many of them in Africa.
The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges, AP reported.
Officials said earlier that the suspect was dead as investigators said he also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days after the rampage at Brown.
He had been a PhD student in physics who was familiar with the building where the shooting took place, officials said.
Providence police Chief Oscar Perez and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, speaking at a Thursday night press conference, said that Valente took his own life and investigators believe he acted alone.</p><small>2025-12-19 07:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19111156e7ec390.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962015/bangladesh-rocked-by-unrest-after-death-of-student-leader' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh rocked by unrest after death of student leader</strong></a><br><p>Police and paramilitary troops fanned out across Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh on Friday after violent protests overnight over the death of a popular youth leader, with concerns of further unrest ahead of national elections in which he was due to run.
Streets were calm in the morning, but residents in the Muslim-majority South Asian nation said they were worried there could be fresh violence after Friday prayers later in the day.
Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, was a spokesperson for the Inquilab Mancha, or Platform for Revolution, and participated in the student-led protests that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina last year.
He was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last Friday while launching his campaign for the elections.
Hadi was initially treated at a local hospital before being flown to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died after spending six days on life support.
Hadi was an outspoken critic of India, and Inquilab Mancha describes itself on its website as a revolutionary cultural platform inspired by the spirit of uprising.
In Dhaka, videos circulating on social media showed mobs vandalising the offices of the country’s largest daily newspaper, Prothom Alo, as well as The Daily Star, on Thursday night.
The demonstrations were marked by emotionally charged slogans invoking Hadi’s name, with protesters vowing to continue their movement and demanding swift justice.
Several areas remained tense, with additional police and paramilitary forces deployed to prevent further violence.
The fire service said the blaze at The Daily Star was under control. Troops were deployed to the scene, and firefighters rescued journalists trapped inside the building.
Pressure on the government
Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus since August 2024, after Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising.
The government has been grappling with fresh protests over delayed reforms, and warnings of unrest by Hasina’s party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the vote. The elections are scheduled for February 12.
In a televised address to the nation following Hadis death, Yunus said: “His passing represents an irreplaceable loss to the nation’s political and democratic sphere.”
Urging citizens to remain calm, Yunus said the government was committed to ensuring a transparent investigation and bringing all those responsible to justice.
He also appealed for restraint, warning that violence would only undermine the country’s path toward a credible election.
The interim administration has declared Saturday a day of state mourning in honour of Hadi, with national flags to be flown at half-mast and special prayers planned across the country.
The home of the country’s first president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Hasina, was vandalised and set on fire once again, after having been attacked twice previously in February and August last year.
New Age editor Nurul Kabir, who also heads the country’s Editors Council, was harassed by protesters outside The Daily Star building on Thursday night as they vandalised the premises, with videos showing him pushed into a crowd, verbally abused as an Awami League collaborator, and having his hair pulled.
In Dhaka, the premises of the prominent Bengali cultural organisation Chhayanaut were vandalised and torched.
In the northwestern district of Rajshahi, protesters demolished an Awami League party office using a bulldozer, while demonstrators blocked major highways in several other districts.
Violence was also reported in a number of cities across Bangladesh, including the port city of Chittagong, where protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission and set fire to a house belonging to a former Awami League education minister.
The unrest follows fresh anti-India protests earlier in the week, with ties between the neighbours deteriorating since Hasina fled to Delhi.
On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators under the banner July Oikya (July Unity) marched toward the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, chanting anti-India slogans, while also demanding the return of Hasina.</p><small>2025-12-19 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/190951456537b4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962007/un-general-assembly-adopts-pakistan-backed-resolution-reaffirming-right-to-self-determination' target='_blank'><strong>UN General Assembly adopts Pakistan-backed resolution reaffirming right to self-determination</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Thursday adopted by consensus a Pakistan-sponsored resolution that reaffirmed the right to self-determination for peoples still subjected to colonial, foreign, and alien occupation.
According to Pakistan‘s Permanent Mission to the UN, the resolution — titled ‘Universal realisation of the right of the peoples to self-determination’ — was adopted during the UNGA’s 80th session.
“The consensual adoption of the resolution manifests broad international support for the inalienable right of the peoples facing colonialism, alien domination and foreign occupation,“ it said in a post on X.
“For the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and Palestine, the resolution reinforces international attention to their just and legitimate cause and their aspirations for freedom and dignity in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions,” it added.







Diplomats said the adoption of the text by consensus — without a vote — underscored continued global recognition that the denial of self-determination remains a root cause of conflict in several regions, despite repeated UN commitments to bring colonialism to an end.
This year, the United States insisted on voting on almost every resolution presented in the UNGA, even on issues that had previously enjoyed consensus, both in committees and in the Assembly.
However, the Pakistan-sponsored resolution on self-determination was among the very few that the Americans did not insist on putting to a vote, allowing it to pass by consensus. Diplomats said this was likely due to Pakistan’s outreach. Otherwise, Washington had made it clear that it would not allow consensus on every issue, as it could create unnecessary pressure within the UN.
Earlier in the day, Pakistan told the UNGA that persistent failure to uphold the right to self-determination continued to undermine international peace efforts, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia.
Addressing the Assembly on the occasion of International Day against Colonialism in All Its Forms and Manifestations, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon said self-determination was “not merely a historical aspiration, but an enduring obligation” of the international community.
“Recent developments in the Middle East demonstrate that lasting peace cannot be achieved through the continued denial and suppression of the legitimate right to self-determination of the Palestinian people,“ he said.
On occupied Kashmir, the Pakistani envoy reminded the UNGA that the issue was not a bilateral dispute but an internationally recognised one.
“The UNSC, through several resolutions, has recognised the legitimate right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.
“A just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains central to the establishment of durable peace in South Asia,” Ambassador Jadoon added, warning that continued inaction risked further instability in an already volatile region.
Marking the 65th anniversary of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) — Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples — he said the implementation of the declaration and the decolonisation agenda was not confined to Non-Self-Governing Territories alone.
According to the UN, Non-Self-Governing Territories are defined as territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government.
“Rather, it also encompasses people living under alien occupation and foreign domination.
“The overarching objective, therefore, remains to ensure that all such peoples are enabled to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.
He further said that the milestone also served as a reminder of unfinished work.
“While the decolonisation process stands among the UN’s notable achievements, this anniversary compels us to acknowledge that the promise of resolution 1514 (XV) remains unfulfilled,” he said, adding that this failure continued to pose “a serious challenge to the maintenance of international peace and security”.
Aligning Pakistan with a statement delivered by Uganda on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), he said the declaration made clear that colonial domination and exploitation were violations of fundamental human rights and were contrary to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter.
“The right to self-determination is an inalienable and universal right,” he reiterated, stressing that its application could neither be selective nor politically conditional.
Emphasising the UN’s role as a symbol of hope and justice for oppressed peoples, Ambassador Jadoon called for the consistent and non-selective implementation of UN resolutions and urged member states to uphold international law without exception.
Pakistan also called for renewed international resolve to fully and unconditionally eradicate colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.</p><small>2025-12-19 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69449933b83e8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961951/in-decline' target='_blank'><strong>In decline</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN is in decline — in serious, considerable and sharp decline — as manifested by its economic, social and human development indicators. This decline is both relative to other comparable developing countries which have now steadily and increasingly outpaced Pakistan as indicated by multiple indicators, and by what Pakistan’s own indicators used to be. In other words, the economy and related and ancillary sectors, especially in human and social development, are worse now than what they were some years or decades ago. To make matters worse, Pakistan’s recent political economy reorganisation, centralisation and consolidation will ensure that these indicators deteriorate further.
The simplest and most basic indicator which encompasses economic growth, the real GDP growth rate, has been falling consistently over the last four decades and it is improbable that this long-term decline in GDP will be significantly reversed. From highs of near and above six per cent per year, this secular decline has led to a growth rate of barely 3pc. In fact, just in the last six years, GDP growth has been negative in two of those years, minus 1.3pc in 2019-20 and again minus 0.2pc as recently as 2022-23.
It is worth adding that on average, the population in Pakistan has been growing by 2.6pc annually over the last decade, and hence in real terms Pakistanis are worse off. Importantly, in just 25 years, Pakistan will become the third most populous country. At least on one count, there is huge progress and our population multiplies; over the last many years, our population growth rate has been much higher than economic growth.
Beyond these very basic numbers and economic growth rate and population trends, things are even more worrying. When one considers human development, the quality of Pakistan’s 250 million population has been falling markedly. In terms of the UN’s Human Development Index, Pakistan has gradually fallen in position. In 2020-21, Pakistan was ranked 161, in 2023-24 it fell to 164th and in the latest index it has fallen to 168th place, clearly a very considerable and sharp decline.

The PM has declared that Pakistan’s economy ‘is out of the woods’. Clearly, he is looking at a different field of woods.

Crucially, when it comes to women, unconditionally at the core of any development, social, economic or population strategy, things have deteriorated even further. The Global Gender Gap Report 2025 shows that Pakistan is ranked the lowest — 148th out of 148 countries — and has fallen three positions since 2024. Pakistan is ranked in the lower-middle income countries with 16 countries much poorer than Pakistan, yet its ranking is even lower than these countries and is the lowest of all 148 countries in terms of gender ranking. Female labour participation remains very low and access to finance is a major issue. By delaying putting women at the centre of every policy and strategy, Pakistan’s slide will be accentuated.

 

Every government official parrots the ambition of being ready for the revolution that has taken place in communication and information technology; they cite ideas related to AI which most have not even been able to grasp fully. Yet, Pakistan’s secondary enrolment rate today is at the level where South Korea’s was in 1972, while Pakistan’s tertiary enrolment rate today is where South Korea’s was in 1979. These are astonishing numbers, which show that in terms of human capital, so critical for the information and technological age, Pakistan is half a century behind South Korea. With even basic literacy, reading and numeracy skills lacking, we are decades behind other countries and this distance will increase over the next few years.
The prime minister has just declared that Pakistan’s economy ‘is out of the woods’ and the crisis is over. This, at a time when data shows that unemployment in Pakistan today is 7.1pc, the highest in 21 years, with 5.9m people unemployed of which 4.6m are illiterate. Moreover, those who remind us of a ‘demographic dividend’ from having a young population, need to be told that the hi­­­ghest unemployment is amongst those aged 15-29 years, with 3.5m young men and women entering the job market every year. Moreover, research has shown that even for those who work, the real wage of workers in Pakistan has fallen by almost 20pc in the last three years. With the overall investment-GDP ratio the lowest since 1973, at a mere 13pc, and declining further, any hope of reviving the economy seem completely absent. Clearly, the PM is looking at a different field of woods.
Relative to our peers and neighbouring countries, Pakistan is being further left behind. At the recently concluded DawnMedia Conference on Population, economist after economist showed data which emphasised the dismal state of Pakistan’s economy compared to others. Dr Hanid Mukhtar presented figures showing that in 1990, the per capita income of Pakistan was twice that of Bangladesh and 56pc higher than that of India. In 2024, Bangladesh’s per capita income is 53pc higher, and that of India is 71pc higher than that of Pakistan. Moreover, he showed how the growth of Pakistan’s per capita GDP has been lower than that of Bangladesh by 3.5pc per annum, and 3.2pc vis-à-vis India. These significant gaps will grow further, and any attempt to catch up will be outpaced by all other countries around us and in the region. Pakistan is on a losing streak, compared to its own past and compared to other countries which were once less developed than Pakistan.
Given these trends, all of which are downward — and there are a multitude of other datasets amplifying them — signifying relative and absolute deterioration, many economists feel that things have never been this bad. We have all used terms like ‘critical juncture’ or ‘crises’ at numerous points in the past, but perhaps in a highly globalised and competitive world, things may never have been where they currently are. Stabilisation has morphed into stagnation. Given the focus of those running Pakistan’s political economy and making decisions, there is no confidence in either their ability or vision to reverse these trends.

Faisal Karim Kundi

• KP governor wants PTI founder to be shifted to prison in other city or province• Says PTI workers’ daily protests near jail ‘continuous source of inconvenience’
CHINIOT: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday demanded that the government shift incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan to a prison in another city or province, as party activists, due to their daily protests near Adiala jail, had become a continuous source of inconvenience.
“Whenever any foreign dignitary arrives, PTI workers either threaten to shut down Islamabad and Peshawar or stage long protest processions in the federal capital,” he said while addressing a press co­­nference at Rajoa House in Chin­iot, where he had arrived to condo­­le with PPP Central Punjab Gen­e­ral Secretary Syed Hassan Murt­aza over the death of his father.

 

He added that after Pakistan’s success in a clash with New Delhi in May, the country had earned respect within the global community. “Heads of state are visiting Pakistan to strengthen trade ties, but foreign dignitaries are forced to put up with protests by PTI workers,” he continued.
“Even those who come from KP to Islamabad for shopping go to Adiala Jail to have their names registered on the list of those who hold press conferences outside the jail,” he added.
“I therefore request the chief minister [Maryam Nawaz] to shift him to any other jail in Punjab or another province for the protection of other prisoners and to ease the lives of the people of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.”
Mr Kundi maintained that the entire KP government, including its chief minister, visited Adiala jail instead of working for the betterment of the people of the province.
“They stage ‘shows’ there and disturb the lives of people living in and travelling through the area,” he said.
He complained that the Punjab government was not implementing the jail manual, and providing gym and other facilities to Mr Khan that were not available to any other prisoner in the country.
Illegal Afghan immigrants
He welcomed the KP government’s policy shift to send illegal Afghan immigrants and refugees back to their homeland.
He said Pakistan hosted millions of Afghans during the war and now it was time for them to return. “Whenever there is a terrorist activity or an attack on a sensitive installation, Afghan terrorists are found to be involved,” he claimed.
To a question about the ‘Minus Imran Khan’ formula, the KP governor said many PTI leaders themselves wanted to sideline him and keep him in prison so that their businesses could continue.
On the 28th Amendment, he said the amendment was a reality; however, its contents had not been shared with the PPP leadership. “We supported the 26th and 27th Amendments and will support future ones if they are needed for the sake of the country,” he said.
He said that the National Accountability Bureau had become a tool for “kidnap for ransom”, as it arrested corrupt individuals and allowed them to walk away scot-free after paying money through plea bargains.
Mr Kundi claimed that most KP Assembly members were proclaimed offenders and wanted by Islamabad police. He questioned why the police were not arresting them. “The Islamabad police must arrest them when they roam the streets of Islamabad,” he said.
He said PTI was moving ahead with “imported leaders” like Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas becau­­se the party lacked any person to run its parliamentary affairs.
Published in Dawn, December 19th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-19 04:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961955/a-clear-indictment' target='_blank'><strong>A clear indictment</strong></a><br><p>YET again, the UN Security Council’s monitoring report on Afghanistan has painted a grim picture of the presence of transnational terrorist groups on Afghan territory. The report, a regular feature, reiterates that Afghanistan remains a staging ground for some of the most lethal terrorist outfits in the world. Pakistan, which has been a victim of the TTP, based in Afghanistan, has known this painful reality for years.
The report notes that over 20 international and regional terrorist organisations currently call Afghanistan home. These include IS-K, Al Qaeda, the TTP and ETIM, among others.
With the exception of IS-K, these groups have good relations with the Afghan Taliban. Importantly, the report says that the Taliban’s claims that no militant groups are based on their soil are “not credible”.

 

For Pakistan, the TTP — largely due to the permissive environment it enjoys under Afghan Taliban rule — poses a major security challenge. The UN document says that the terrorist group has conducted over 600 attacks against this country in the current year.
Moreover, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud is believed to spend time in Kabul, while other anti-Pakistan terrorists, such as Gul Bahadur, are also based in Afghanistan.
The report highlights links between the TTP and Al Qaeda, as well as ETIM. Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, said to be a front for TTP and Al Qaeda fighters, is amongst the other terrorist groups active next door. Meanwhile, another matter of grave concern is the presence of madressahs run by IS-K near the Pakistani border.
The details mentioned in the UN report shatter any illusion that Taliban-run Afghanistan poses no threat to its neighbours. On the contrary, just as it used to be before the US-led invasion, Afghanistan has become a safe haven for extremely dangerous and violent militant outfits that threaten the region and the world.
And while the report says that there are differences within the upper echelons of the Taliban leadership on how to deal with the TTP, Kabul’s rulers are unlikely to take action against the group, as the regime may actually “lack the ability to do so”.

 

This should be a matter of great concern for the international community, particularly Afghanistan’s neighbours. Nearly all states bordering Afghanistan have experienced terrorist attacks carried out by groups based on Afghan soil, with Pakistan the hardest hit.
The way forward does not seem to be clear-cut. More conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan will not solve the problem in the long run. Talks with the Kabul regime have also failed to provide meaningful outcomes.
In such a situation, perhaps the least bad option is to reach out to the relatively ‘moderate’ elements within the Taliban set-up, and press upon them the need to stop terrorists from threatening Afghanistan’s neighbours.

Simply put, teachers matter and good teaching is important for ensuring better learning outcomes.
However, recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers gainfully and efficiently employed is not easy. In Pakistan, a couple of decades back, teacher recruitment was seen as having too much discretion with not enough reliance on rules. Allegations of corruption and nepotism in teacher recruitment were common. Many of these charges were based on facts. Two decades ago, reforms were introduced to move to more rules-based (merit-based) recruitment. This has definitely reduced the allegations, and litigation on recruitment issues has also decreased. But has it improved teacher and/or teaching quality? Has it improved student learning? And what unintended consequences has it led to? These are important follow-ups for completing the loop for feedback and continuous improvement. ‘Merit’-based recruitment might reduce corruption, but does it allow us to differentiate between good and bad teachers? If not, the reform might be of limited value.
Many places worldwide have significant requirements for specific courses, diplomas and even degrees before a person can become a teacher. When we moved towards merit-based recruitment, provincial governments removed the requirements for education degrees before joining as a teacher. This has increased the pool of candidates for teaching (a physics graduate can come into teaching directly) but many of these applicants did not choose to be teachers and have no understanding of what teaching is: you can be good at physics but teach it badly. How has this impacted learning outcomes?
Some jurisdictions even have teacher licensing. Teacher licensing has often been talked about in Pakistan but it was only recently that Sindh introduced it. But will licensing improve teaching and learning? We have 1.5 million or so teachers in Pakistan and still suffer a shortage. Will licensing help? Is it only for government schools or also private schools? Will teachers be required to have licences in low-fee private schools, where sometimes they teach Matriculation- or Intermediate-level students? Who will pay for the cost?

Recruiting, motivating, and keeping good teachers efficiently employed is not easy.

Once a teacher has been recruited, is she a teacher forever? Does she need any education, training or upgradation? Is there a role for continuous professional development and how is it to be structured? Punjab has some 450,000 teachers. How do you design effective professional development systems for such large numbers? Do we design devolved systems or centralised ones? How do we ensure quality and some level of uniformity across the system? We have had continuing professional development systems in place, but the general feeling is that they don’t seem to work and haven’t had the intended impact and definitely not the one needed.
Once deployed, how do we keep teachers motivated to teach effectively for the entire length of their careers — 30-35 years? What are effective career paths for teachers? If a teacher is a good Grade 1 teacher today, how do we ensure that she will be a good, motivated and effective Grade 1 teacher in 10, 20 or 30 years from now? What should happen to her financial returns and other ‘incentives’ so that she is able to have a rewarding career in Grade 1?
We do not have research on most of these important questions. Which means we do not have effective feedback loops on policies. Policies keep coming and getting implemented. But what consequences do they have? How can we improve if we don’t have effective feedback loops that research consequences and impact?

 

What is heartening is that there is an increasing realisation — in government and academia and among development partners and research institutions — of the need to have these feedback loops and to do relevant policy research on important questions. Most education departments already have specific implementation and planning units to structure some of this work. Development partners have historically funded and encouraged some research, but this has recently become more structured and is being given due importance. Academic research output has also been steadily increasing in education in Pakistan.
The most recent and current impetus has come from a very innovative research support programme funded by FCDO and called the Data and Research in Education-Research Consortium. DARE-RC has funded some 35 studies in the education sector, five to six of them on teacher issues. These studies are in collaboration with education departments. The programme is of medium term (it just closed the fourth round of call for proposals).
The results of the studies will allow us to bring out relevant issues more clearly, and some of them will start answering some of the questions raised above. By focusing on local researchers, the programme is also developing the capacity for research in education in Pakistan and a community of practice in the area. The hope is that other programmes, following this one and funded by government and partners, will continue to build on this approach, so that we not only have answers to the questions but also the local capacity to do such work. We will always have more questions and we need communities and people who are able to answer them so that we can keep improving outcomes in education.

 

Pakistan must have around 1.5-2m teachers today. With millions of children still out of school, and with most in-school children getting a poor quality of education across the country, we need more teachers — more motivated and committed teachers — and a lot more teacher training to ensure better content knowledge as well as a sound understanding of optimal pedagogical strategies. We also need much better policies for management and regulation of teaching, and effective feedback loops to ensure things keep improving. In this context, DARE-RC offers an interesting model for developing the capacity needed for such work. I hope education departments will not only look at the outcomes of the research studies being done under DARE-RC, but also at how the research capacity being built can be strengthened and deepened beyond the programme. This is important if we are to ensure our policies improve over time.

“They underestimated our military power and thought we will not react. They never expected a befitting response,” he said while speaking at a seminar here.
The seminar was organised by an overseas Pakistanis group led by Barrister Shehzada Hayat, in collaboration with the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS), headed by Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum to pay homage to Pakistan’s martyrs, express solidarity with the armed forces, and commemorate the 149th birth anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The former air chief said the telling response by Pakistan shattered the myth of “shining India”. He chided India for blaming Chinese help to Pakistan for its failure saying “If we have Chinese JF-17 aircraft, you also have Rafale jets.

Overseas Pakistanis’ contribution to national economy praised

He made it clear that Chinese pilots did not come to fight with India during the four-day tension between the two South Asian nuclear powers.
Highlighting the importance of air power, he referred to founding father of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam’s remarks that a nation without a strong air force is at the mercy of any aggressor.
Air Marshal Aman said wars were not just about aircraft and tanks and stressed the key role of support assets. He stressed that air power and technology-driven capabilities have become central to modern national security.
Emphasising institutional development, education, and indigenous capability, he underlined the importance of linking research, operations and innovation.
He cautioned that Pakistan must prioritise its national interest and avoid involvement in others’ wars. He also stressed the need for embracing smaller provinces and honouring those who rendered sacrifices for the country.
Federal Minister for Investment and Chairman of Board of Investment,Qaiser Sheikh, said the event reflected Pakistan’s core values of sacrifice, unity and resilience.
He paid tribute to martyrs and lauded the armed forces for safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and stability.
The minister emphasised the role of overseas Pakistanis as economic contributors and goodwill ambassadors, reaffirming the government’s commitment to improving investor confidence and promoting Pakistan as an attractive investment destination.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum highlighted the contributions of overseas Pakistanis to the country’s economy, calling them Pakistan’s ambassadors and an economic lifeline.

The proclamations specifically ask Sohail Afridi, Meena Khan, Amjad Khan, Shafiullah Jan, and Amjad Afridi to appear before the court immediately to face ongoing legal proceedings.
The court took action under Section 87 of the Anti-Terrorism Act after noting the suspects were “continuously avoiding court appearances and not complying with earlier summons”.

Officials post summon notices at judicial complex, public places in Islamabad

The court stated in its order that the defendants’ repeated absence left the bench with “no option but to initiate proclamation proceedings”.
The court has granted the group a final opportunity to surrender. The notices warned that if the accused fail to appear during the proceedings under Section 87, the court “will proceed with further legal action in accordance with the law”.
The case stems from an FIR registered in connection with a Nov 26 protest, in which the chief minister and the other named individuals were nominated as accused.
Earlier on Dec 17, ATC Judge Abual Mohammad Hasnat Zulqarnain initiated proceedings to declare CM Afridi, provincial minister Meena Khan Afridi and Shafiullah Jan Iqbal Afridi as proclaimed offenders for repeatedly failing to appear before the court.
During the hearing, none of the accused appeared despite repeated summons. Taking notice of their continuous absence, the court initiated proclamation proceedings against all three and adjourned the hearing.
A case has been registered against CM Afridi and others at Ramna police station over their alleged involvement in the November 26 protest.
Earlier, the same court had initiated similar proceedings against the chief minister and other accused in another case registered at Noon police station.

IS-K is a branch of the Islamic State terrorist organisation active in Central and South Asia, according to the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
The UN’s 16th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team noted that IS-K’s ability to operate in the region had been degraded as a result of high-profile arrests by Pakistan, such as that of Azzam from the border region this May.
The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said that Azzam was arrested by intelligence agencies during an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The APP report claimed that following his arrest, IS-K propaganda arms, such as the Al-Azaim Foundation, had suffered a major blow.
“Overall, the capability of [IS-K] has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations,” the UN report read. “Key [IS-K] commanders and ideologues have been neutralised, and the numbers of [IS-K] fighters have likely been reduced. Several plotted attacks have been disrupted.”
It further noted that IS-K’s capability to operate freely on both sides of the border has been disrupted, but acknowledged that Kabul’s claims of no terrorist groups operating in or from their soil are “not credible”.
“The Taliban contend that no terrorist groups operate in or from Afghanistan,” the report read. “Member state reporting, however, indicates that a range of terrorist groups still operate in the country, with varying degrees of autonomy and oversight from Taliban authorities.”
It added: “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, [IS-K] is reported to have indoctrinated children in madressahs, establishing a suicide training course for minors around 14 years of age.”
In a December 8 letter, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, requested that the report be brought to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC).
Who is Azzam?
The UNSC says that Azzam held the position of IS-K spokesperson since the group first established itself in Afghanistan in 2015. Islamabad-based platform The Khorasan Diary stated that he is the group’s second-in-command, while the European Council says he operated their media branch, Al-Azaim Media.
Shan A Zain wrote for Jamestown Foundation’s Militant Leadership Monitor journal that Azzam was born in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province and, before becoming IS-K’s chief propagandist, worked for at least three local radio stations and wrote books and poetry.
His major work, Travelers of the Maze, tells the purported stories of IS fighters living in the Spin Ghar mountains, according to Zain. Excerpts were shared over Telegram by would-be recruits.
“Sultan Aziz Azzam has been credited with recruiting IS members to carry out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan,” Zain wrote. “He has written several books and articles narrating stories about [fighters] in order to inspire people to join IS ranks.”
“As [IS-K’s] spokesperson, Azam has played an instrumental role in spreading ISIL’s violent … ideology, glorifying and justifying terrorist acts,” the UNSC’s website reads.
“Building on his former experience as an Afghan journalist, his activity as [IS-K’s] spokesperson has increased [IS-K’s] visibility and influence among its followers.”
Azzam claimed responsibility on behalf of IK-K for an August 26, 2021, suicide attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and circulated messages from the group following the assassination of three female journalists on March 2, 2021 and a prison attack in Jalalabad on August 3, 2020.
Previous action against IS-K in Pakistan
In June this year, then-United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism, citing the nation’s struggle against IS-K among other actors.
“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
“They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.
In November, a key IS-K commander was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn.
Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.</p><small>2025-12-19 02:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/190812211b7a962.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961907/pti-sit-ins-prompt-heightened-security-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>PTI sit-ins prompt heightened security outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>• 1,200 policemen, anti-riot personnel deployed; number of pickets increased• Party leaders return without visiting Imran after being barred by prison authorities
RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: As the PTI staged two sit-ins outside the jail in as many weeks, the Punjab government has deployed more than 1,200 police officials, installed additional pickets, and deployed anti-riot police in the vicinity of Adiala jail, in an apparent bid to pre-empt such protests.
Separately, the jail authorities also barred the PTI leaders, including KP’s former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who had arrived in Rawalpindi to meet their incarcerated party chief, Imran Khan.
According to the Islamabad High Court, Mr Khan can have two weekly meetings with his family and party leaders, but the authorities have routinely restricted such visits, much to the PTI’s chagrin. Last Tuesday, the PTI leaders staged a protest, which was dispersed by police with water cannons after midnight.
In a seemingly pre-emptive measure that would dissuade protesters from congregating outside the prison, protective measures around the jail have now been strengthened.
Besides more than 1200 police personnel, including the Elite Force and women police, four police squads have been put on standby for emergencies. The police will be equipped with rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and other anti-riot tools.
Similarly, one police picket was established at the jail’s gate and the second was established at Gate 5, while two pickets were set up at the Gorakhpur Road and near the Shaighan Factory. The area was also inspected by the Special Branch personnel and the bomb disposal squad for security measures.
In addition, traffic police wardens, remained on patrol in the area to keep the flow of traffic smooth during the proceedings of cases inside the jail. On Thursday, about 25 PTI supporters, including MPAs, visited the jail but returned empty-handed.
PTI leaders return without meeting
The PTI leaders, after spending a couple of hours outside the prison, returned after the jail administration did not allow them to meet Mr Khan. Talking to Dawn, Mr Jhagra said that the PTI leaders reached Adiala after 2pm and started waiting for permission to meet Imran Khan. He said the police told them they had no orders to allow them to enter the jail. “We waited there till 4:30pm and then decided to leave,” he said.
PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr, Liaqat Ali Khan, and Taimur Khan Jhagra, had come to meet Imran Khan but they were denied permission. This time, the PTI did not give the name of KP CM Sohail Afridi for the meeting.
Speaking to media outside the prison, he warned the ‘powers that be’ to beware of the day when things would go out of the hands of the party and people would take things into their own hands and take to the streets. Mr Jhagra said that government functionaries were claiming, while giving interviews to foreign media, including Sky News, that 870 meetings with Mr Khan had been allowed.
“However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed but not a single meeting between Imran Khan and his political friends has been allowed. Party leaders arrive here every week, but they are not allowed to meet Imran. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, Imran’s relatives have been allowed to meet him just once or twice,” he said.







To a question, Mr Jhagra said the major issue was that only Imran Khan’s narrative had credibility while the hybrid system has no credibility.
To another query, he said it was unfortunate that an ATA case was registered against peaceful protesters.
“We have been trying to convince the global community that we are fighting a war against terrorism, but cases of terrorism are being registered against PTI workers. How can we convince the world that we are against terrorism,” he wondered.
When asked why Sohail Afridi had not come, Mr Jhagra said that the KP CM has a double responsibility. “He is running the province, along with making efforts to secure the release of Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said.
To a question about why the PTI was not giving a call for street agitation, he said that it was also the responsibility of the party to protect the lives of workers and not expose them to bullets.

ISLAMABAD: No decision has been taken yet on contributing troops to the planned International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, seeking to quell renewed speculation about Washington’s pressure on Islamabad for joining the mission.
“About Pakistan’s participation in the ISF, we have not taken a decision to participate in ISF as yet,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
ISF forms a key component of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, a 20-point framework announced in September that facilitated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in October.
On Nov 17, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution, with Russia and China abstaining, endorsing the plan and authorising the establishment of the ISF as a temporary multinational force to support security, demilitarisation, and reconstruction in Gaza. Pakistan had supported the resolution.
The FO spokesperson’s clarification on Pakistan’s possible contribution to ISF came amid growing conjecture that the Trump administration is stepping up pressure on Pakistan to commit troops to the force.
Those reports were fuelled by a Reuters report, which claimed that Field Marshal Asim Munir — in his capacity as both army chief and chief of defence forces — was expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks for talks with President Trump, with the Gaza stabilisation force likely to feature prominently on the agenda.
Asked about the report, Mr Andrabi was initially noncommittal on whether such a visit was in the works. When pressed, he pushed back against the suggestion that the trip had been finalised.
“On the visit of the chief of army staff/chief of defence forces, as reported by Reuters, I can contradict the Reuters story in its essence that it seemed to suggest that the visit has been planned and there is a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that,” he said.
“We would wait for an official announcement from the government of Pakistan in the event of such a visit. Our political and military leadership visits different capitals, and when an official visit is organised, an official announcement is made prior to it, which in this case, has not been made.”
Meanwhile, the White House also said that no meeting had been scheduled. “This is not on the President’s calendar at this time,” a White House official said on background, responding to an Arab News query about a possible Trump-Munir meeting.
On the ISF itself, Mr Andrabi said discussions were continuing internationally but emphasised that Pakistan had not received any formal request to deploy troops.
“The discussion on ISF is ongoing in certain capitals. I am not aware of any specific requests made to Pakistan to send troops. As stated, we have not taken any decision on this subject as yet,” he said.
The spokesman’s remarks appeared to contrast with earlier comments by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who had said Pakistan was ready “in principle” to contribute to the force, subject to clarity on its mandate and terms of reference.
“We are definitely ready to contribute to the force; the prime minister has in principle already announced after consultation with the field marshal that we will contribute, but this decision cannot be taken until it is decided what its (ISF) mandate and TOR (terms of reference) will be,” Mr Dar said a few weeks ago.
Mr Dar had also drawn a red line over any role involving disarmament of Hamas. “We are not ready for that (disarmament of Hamas). This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said, adding that Indonesia had expressed similar reservations.
Dar noted that Indonesia had offered 20,000 troops and that PM Shehbaz Sharif had signalled that Pakistan would positively consider participation in principle.
It may be noted that the US Central Command hosted a conference in Qatar on Tuesday with dozens of partner countries to discuss ISF’s command structure and other unresolved operational issues. Pakistan was among nearly 45 countries attending the meeting.
The US State Department has formally approached more than 70 countries seeking troops or funding for the proposed force. Some 19 countries have reportedly so far indicated willingness to assist through troops, logistics, or equipment, with international deployment in Gaza potentially beginning as early as next month.

In a post on X, PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib said he met SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad and discussed issues related to digital asset adoption, the implementation of central bank digital currency and Pakistan’s regulatory road­­map for digital assets.







President Zardari promulgated the Pakistan Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025 on July 8, 2025, with the stated objective of licensing, regulating and supervising virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.
Pakistan has since set up PVARA to regulate virtual-asset and blockchain-related activities.
Separately, the Ministry of Finance has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance, a global blockchain and digital-asset technology company, to explore potential collaboration, including tokenisation initiatives.

State Bank reserves jump to $15.9bn after IMF disbursement

In a post on Wednesday, Binance said Pakistan had signed an MoU to explore tokenising up to $2bn in state-owned assets.
Under the arrangement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the initiative could involve blockchain-based distribution of Pakistan’s sovereign bonds, treasury bills and commodity reserves, including oil, gas and metals.

 

He described the MoU as a signal of Pakistan’s reform trajectory, adding that the “next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality”.
Pakistan’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has also issued preliminary clearances to Binance and HTX to begin local licensing processes. The no-objection certificates allow the exchanges to register on the country’s anti-money laundering system and prepare full licence applications, but do not permit them to operate at this stage.
Binance founder Chang­­peng Zhao, who serves as a strategic adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council, described the MoU as “a great signal” for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan, and said it marked the beginning of a move towards full deployment of the tokenisation initiative.
Mr Saqib has said Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest crypto market by retail activity, with an estimated 40 million users and annual trading volume exceeding $300bn.
In July, the SBP governor said the central bank planned to launch a pilot for a digital currency and was finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government sought to modernise the financial system.
SBP reserves hit $15.9bn
State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves rose to $15.886bn following the receipt of $1.2bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to central bank data released on Thursday.
The SBP said that during the week ended Dec 12, its foreign exchange reserves increased by $1.3bn to $15.886bn, mainly due to the receipt of SDR 914 million (equivalent to about $1.2bn) from the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility.
The country’s total liquid foreign reserves stood at $21.089bn, including $5.202bn of net foreign reserves held by commercial banks.

ISLAMABAD: Develop­ment spending under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) remained subdued in the first five months of the current fiscal year, with utilisation amounting to just 9.2 per cent of the Rs1 trillion annual allocation amid fiscal rationing to meet the IMF’s contingency measures for growing revenue shortfall.
“Development spending remained modest, with Rs92 billion utilised against Rs196bn sanctioned, led mainly by infrastructure,” the Ministry of Planning and Development said in its Monthly Development Outlook (December 2025). It added that foreign-funded projects showed relatively better utilisation, with Rs12.8bn spent out of Rs25.1bn sanctioned.
At Rs92bn, the July-November utilisation was 20pc lower than the Rs115bn spent in the same period last year. The ministry attributed the slowdown to “significant reduction in expenditure by provinces, special areas and the Ministry of Railways”.
The government has given a written commitment to the IMF for contingency measures as part of the recent $1.2bn disbursement, as a five-month revenue shortfall touched Rs430bn.
According to the undertaking, if Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collections continue to lag in the second quarter of FY26, and other tax receipts fail to bridge the gap, the government will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase the federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the Eighth Schedule of the sales tax regime to the general GST framework.
“If by the end of the second quarter of FY26, there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26,” it added.
The report said ministries and divisions were sanctioned Rs196bn for the five-month period, against which Rs92bn was reported as expenditure.
The low release and utilisation of development funds come despite a 1.6pc budget surplus in the first quarter of the fiscal year, driven by elevated State Bank profits and petroleum levy collections, and as the government has sought to close hundreds of projects to focus resources on strategically important schemes at advanced stages of development for their early completion.

 

A sector-wise expenditure breakdown showed that the infrastructure sector had been allocated Rs626.767bn (63pc) in FY26, of which Rs55.238bn had been utilised till Nov 30. Within infrastructure, the transport and communication sector received the highest allocation of Rs333.484bn, which posted an expenditure of Rs30.433bn.
The energy sector and physical planning and housing sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.52bn and Rs7bn against allocations of Rs122.653bn and Rs72.725bn, respectively. This meant the energy sector consumed less than 3pc in five months, while physical planning and housing utilised 9.6pc.
The water sector, with an allocation of Rs98bn, reported an expenditure of Rs14.281bn (14.6pc) in five months.
The utilisation was relatively better in the social sector. It was allocated Rs169.309bn (17pc) in the budget, wherein Rs60.75bn was allocated for the education sector, including higher education, which spent an amount of Rs12.292bn.
The health and nutrition sector utilised Rs211 million against an allocation of Rs16.8bn, accounting for only 1.25pc in five months. Furthermore, Rs21.7bn was allocated for “Others”, of which only Rs2.122bn (9.8pc) could be utilised in five months.
The budget entailed an allocation of Rs11.167bn to promote transparency and good governance and to provide an enabling environment for investors, but only Rs1.015bn could be utilised in five months.
The science and information technology sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.619bn as of mid-December against an allocation of Rs37.586bn, accounting for 9.6pc.
The food and agriculture sector spent Rs605m against its allocation of Rs5.1bn, while the industrial sector utilised Rs227m against Rs2.856bn and stood at 11.8pc and 7.9pc, respectively.
The report said the PSDP portfolio comprised 86 foreign-funded projects with a total foreign cost component of Rs4.2tr, of which 15 projects are fully foreign-funded, while the remaining 61 projects are implemented with counterpart local funding.
It said a PSDP review was conducted from Nov 10-12 to assess financial and physical progress on the ongoing development portfolio. The executing agencies revealed that Rs90bn had been utilised during the first quarter, and 313 projects were expected to be completed this fiscal year.
It said the government had decided to prioritise fast-moving schemes, strengthen project execution and ensure timely allocations to maximise development impact. The report said Pakistan’s economic and development outlook was optimistic, supported by stronger fiscal management, moderating inflation and resilient remittance inflows.
“The development trajectory is steadily improving as high-priority initiatives in health, education, infrastructure, energy and governance are enhancing economic efficiency and social impact,” it said.
Under the mechanism announced by the Ministry of Finance for the current fiscal year, the government should release 15pc of budgeted allocation in the first quarter, followed by 20pc in the second quarter, 25pc in the third and the remaining 40pc in the last.

“The president has approved the de-notification of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri as [a] judge, IHC, on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC verdict and in accordance with the Constitution and law,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said.







The development came hours after the an IHC division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar ruled on Thursday that Justice Jahangiri’s elevation to the superior court “without lawful authority” and that he “ceased to hold” the office of the IHC judge forthwith.
The bench, which also included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, issued the judgement, which was reserved earlier in the day, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge.
A short written order of the court, available with Dawn, said at the time of Justice Jahangiri’s appointment as an additional judge of the IHC, “as well as at the time of his confirmation as a judge of the IHC, he was not holding a valid LLB degree, which is a prerequisite for enrolment as an advocate”.
“When he could not be considered as an advocate, then consequently he was not eligible for elevation as a judge of a high court in terms of the requirements of Article 175-A of the Constitution,” it added.
On the basis of this observation, the court ruled that Justice Jahangiri’s elevation to the IHC was “without lawful authority, as he was not eligible to be elevated as a judge of a high court”.
“Thus, he ceased to hold the office of the judge of the IHC forthwith.”
The court had also directed the law ministry to denotify him as a judge of the IHC. “All the pending miscellaneous applications are also disposed of,” it added.
The bench’s decision came a day after Justice Jahangiri accused CJ Dogar of being “biased” against him and requested the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to set aside the recent IHC decision to hear a petition challenging his law degree. The same day, he also filed a formal complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — against the chief justice.
The hearing
Prior to the issuance of the judgment, University of Karachi (KU) Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted a record of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree to the court.
He said the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s degree for having been “secured through unfair means”.
“Justice Jahangiri was found cheating and creating disturbance in an examination hall in 1988,” following which he was debarred from sitting an exam until 1992, he said.
However, instead of complying with the decision, the judge appeared in an exam in 1989 under a changed name, the registrar alleged.
He also submitted a log pertaining to marksheets and results to justify the KU syndicate’s decision.
During his arguments, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, who was representing Justice Jahangiri, objected to the bench hearing the case.
He contended that a judge who faced legal proceedings could not hear the petition involving a fellow judge, who had challenged his posting.
In July, Justice Jahagiri, along with four other IHC judges, had filed an intra-court appeal against the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges requested the SC not to consider Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they took fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The intra-court appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Constitutional Amendment and eventually dismissed for non-prosecution.
Sheikh’s argument today seemed to be referring to this matter.
He also highlighted that the Sindh High Court (SHC) had issued a stay order in connection with the matter, arguing that the IHC bench should not hear the case.
This, seemingly, was a reference ot the SHC order suspending the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree by the KU syndicate.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmad, who was also representing Justice Jahangiri, requested more time from the court to submit a reply.
For his part, the petitioner in the case, lawyer Mian Dawood, alleged that Justice Jahangiri had “misused” the SHC stay order. “Instead of clearing his name […] the judge has been filing petitions and scandalising his chief justice,” he commented.
According to the court’s short written order, the bench observed that it had given “ample opportunity” to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply along with disputed education credentials, “but he failed to do so for the reasons best known to him”.
“As such, this court has left with no other option but to proceed further in the matter.”
The court also observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge “is personal to the individual and has no nexus with the performance of duties as a court or as a member of the court”.
“The qualifications for appointment of judges of the superior courts are duly provided in the Constitution. Possession of the qualifications prescribed under the Constitution is sine qua non (requirement) for an individual to hold the office of a judge of a superior court,” it said.
The court order further stated that during the case’s proceedings, it had heard arguments from counsel for the contesting parties, the representatives of the Islamabad Bar Council, IHC and Islamabad District Bar Associations, and perused the record with their able assistance.
Eventually, the court uniitiaaly reserved its judgement in the case on Thursday and removed Justice Jahangiri from his office.
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the KU controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the SJC last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by Dawood.
The controversy followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
After the IHC resumed the case’s proceedings, the Higher Education Commi­ssion (HEC) submitted a detailed report to the court on December 8, endorsing KU’s findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
The HEC claimed it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
At the next hearing on December 9, the court declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
Another notable development in the case came on December 15, when Justice Jahangiri appeared before the court in person, presented arguments in his defence and raised objections on the division hearing his case. He expressed a lack of confidence in the bench on the ground that he had filed an intra-court appeal CJ Dogar.
He also took exception to the “haste” in which the proceedings were being held and criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
The court, however, dimissed his objections.
On December 17 — a day before Thursday’s hearing — Justice Jahangiri moved a plea through senior counsel Uzair Karamat Bhandari in the FCC, requesting it to set aside the Dec 9 order that declared Dawood’s plea maintainable.
The FCC was told that CJ Dogar was biased against Justice Jahangiri and therefore disqualified from hearing any matter relating to his appointment. Justice Jahangiri recalled in the petition that he had already challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC, followed by his elevation as IHC CJ and in these circumstances judicial propriety required that the IHC chief justice should not preside over proceedings concerning the writ of quo warranto.
Separately, Justice Jahangiri also filed a formal complaint against his boss, IHC CJ Dogar, before the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution, accusing him of misconduct, bias, and violation of the Code of Conduct for Judges in relation to proceedings concerning the legitimacy of his degree and appointment.
According to the complaint, while the matter was sub judice, the IHC chief justice discussed the pending case with Justice Jahangiri and advised him, both directly and indirectly, to resign from office. Justice Jahangiri asserted that such conduct alone disqualified Justice Dogar from hearing the case.
The complaint alleged that during these discussions, the chief justice acknowledged that “tremendous pressure” was being exerted on him to decide the matter expeditiously and against Justice Jahangiri. It was claimed that Justice Dogar suggested that if he were to submit a post-dated resignation and hand it over to him for ‘safe-keeping’, it would help placate those exerting pressure and allow proceedings to be delayed.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.
He was also among the five IHC judges who submitted separate petitions at the SC together in September against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.</p><small>2025-12-19 02:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18202809e0bc2b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961827/sudden-variation-in-chenab-rivers-flow-affects-wheat-other-crops-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Sudden variation in Chenab River’s flow affects wheat, other crops in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>As the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, the situation is badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab.
“The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity.
“When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,” he said.
He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.”
“The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.”
According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18.
The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10.
No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17.
Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn, they face difficulty irrigating the wheat crop and have to purchase water from tube well owners when there is no water in designated channels.
“Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully.
“It is affecting the main and other crops as well.”
Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away.
“We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.”
Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty.
“Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums.
FO seeks clarification from India
Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week.
Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River.
“Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said.
“Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said.
“Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
“We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said.
He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”.
“The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said.
“Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
Removal of Indian woman’s hijab
During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism.
Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh. A minister from Uttar Pradesh had defended Kumar, before backtracking.
“The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said.
“The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said.
“Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added.
“We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-18 22:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18235404917032e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961864/domestic-worker-allegedly-tortured-by-suspect-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Domestic worker allegedly tortured by suspect in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A domestic worker was allegedly beaten by a man in Karachi earlier this week, it emerged on Thursday.
According to a first information report filed at Gabol Town police station — dated December 13 and available with Dawn — the complainant stated that she was working as a cleaner at a private residence when she got into an argument with the suspect on December 10.
“On December 11, when I finished working at a house, the suspect came and started beating me as I was descending some stairs,” she alleged. “He pushed me down the stairs while verbally abusing me.”
The complainant further alleged that bystanders also beat her, leaving her with facial and internal injuries.
According to the FIR, the suspect who initially assaulted the complainant was booked under Sections 337A (punishment for assault), 354 (assault or criminal force to [a] woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
After a video of the incident went viral, Sindh Minister for Women’s Development, Shahina Sher Ali, took stern notice of the incident and sought details from police, a statement from her office said.
“The provincial minister directed the police to conduct an immediate and transparent inquiry into the condemnable incident,” the statement read
“In the video, the accused is clearly subjecting the woman to the worst torture,” Sher Ali was quoted as saying. “Whatever the motives of the incident, physical violence against the woman will not be tolerated under any circumstances and the suspect should be arrested immediately and severely punished.”
Last week, seven foreign nationals were booked for assaulting local women and trespassing into a slum in Islamabad, located a kilometre away from Golra Police Station.
The case was registered under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 354 and 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), on a complaint lodged by Mohammad Khan, a resident of the slum at Chora Stop near the police station.
The police said the foreign nationals forcefully entered the slum, which comprises huts and began making videos of the women living there.</p><small>2025-12-18 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18214826d3f9022.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961862/study-reveals-rampant-labour-rights-abuses-in-textile-factories-across-karachi-and-faislabad' target='_blank'><strong>Study reveals ‘rampant’ labour rights abuses in textile factories across Karachi and Faislabad</strong></a><br><p>A new study has revealed that labour rights abuses remained rampant in major textile factories in major production hubs — Karachi and Faisalabad — manufacturing healthcare exports to Europe.
The report was titled “Public money, private harm: The role of EU procurement in perpetuating labour violations: lessons from Pakistan and Sweden”. The 52-page study was conducted collaboratively by Swedwatch and local organisations, including AwazCDS-Pakistan and NowCommunities, building on testimonies of textile factory workers from Karachi and Faisalabad, where it revealed rampant labour rights violations, enabled by weak enforcement of EU procurement rules and labour laws.
It revealed that using social audits and certifications as a way of ensuring compliance “repeatedly fail to capture or remedy these violations, raising serious concerns about their efficacy.”
At the outset of the report launch in Karachi today, Executive Director NowCommunities, Farhat Parveen, outlined the issues faced by workers in both informal and formal sectors in Pakistan, including their absence from consensus, lack of social protection, maternity benefits, occupational health and safety, and dire working conditions, noting that limited legislation exists within the country to address their issues.
AwazCDS-Pakistan founder Zia-ur-Rehman detailed that the scope of the study centred around “the textile sector, particularly products exported to the EU and the situation of labour rights at the lowest tier of the supply chain.”
European states such as Sweden, in this case, rely heavily on textile healthcare imports from Pakistan, the report said, highlighting issues within the supply chain process.
“The study was conducted in two districts across nine textile mills, which export to Sweden in Faisalabad and Karachi. The aim was to examine the labour conditions, environmental codes, whether health and safety are taken into consideration, fair wages, and the right to unionisation.”
He explained that the study was based on focus group discussions, which engaged around 98 factory workers.
The report noted that the textile industry around the world was “particularly vulnerable to labour rights abuses, including low wages, precarious employment, poor working conditions, and gender-based pay gaps.”
It noted that the problem was made “pronounced” in countries like Pakistan, “where textile factories supply goods for European public contracting authorities”, including Sweden.
It noted that in textile industries in Karachi and Faisalabad, which are the major “production hubs” of the country, workers often “endure excessive hours, unsafe workplaces, lack of social protection, and an absence of formal employment contracts.”
It detailed that the abuses were “exacerbated” by the lack of enforcement of labour laws and the lack of implementation of EU procurement rules.
It noted that the rules had failed to “prevent human rights abuses” in the lower tier of production.
The study presented ten key findings across the areas of wage theft, exploitation, gender pay gap, lack of social security, and overreliance on social audits, among others.
Contractual exploitation fueling ‘rights abuse’
Rehman revealed that the workers employed at the textile factories under review in the study were not hired contractually, as a way for companies to “evade” responsibility.
He recalled that “many of the participants in the study told us that we are given a contractor’s contract, which is usually in English, and we are forced to sign it,” adding that the process was often shrouded in “secrecy.”
As per the report, “these contractors supply labour to numerous home-textile factories serving the Swedish public sector while also collaborating with other subcontractors — creating a complex web of informal employment arrangements.”
It further noted: “Although the Pakistani labour code recognises the role of private contractors in recruitment, it does not require them to ensure minimum wages or social security.
“As a result, informal contractual arrangements have come to dominate Pakistan’s labour market, enabling factory owners to bypass legal obligations and evade accountability. This system fuels widespread labour rights abuse,” it said.
Wage theft ‘pervasive’
Rehman expressed concern that the average worker at these textile factories was getting approximately Rs25,000 per month, lower than the government-mandated minimum wage of Rs37,000 as of June 2024.

According to the report, “some factories display banners at their entrance stating that workers are paid the minimum wage by the first of each month. Yet, interviews revealed that these claims are often deceptive, with workers consistently receiving much lower pay.”
The report cited the account of a 38-year-old worker with 15 years of experience in Faisalabad’s textile sector, who was earning between Rs15,000–17,000 per month.
The AwazCDS-Pakistan founder called on European countries to notify living wages for countries involved in the downstream supply.
‘Stark’ gender pay gap
The study revealed that despite women working the same hours as their male counterparts, they earned as little as Rs6,000 at times.

“Both men and women do the same kind of work [..] despite the fact that women are given lower wages than men,” Rehman said, adding that women were also not given “adequate training”.
“Most supervisory roles are given to men,” he said, quoting the participants of the study.
As per the report, “one female worker from Karachi shared [that] even when workers perform the same tasks, women and younger employees often face wage discrimination. The management claims it’s based on performance, but the bias is evident.”
‘Significant’ barriers to unionisation
The report, in its findings, revealed that unions were often “prohibited”, and the association of a worker with a union could result in “severe repercussions such as immediate dismissal.”


Screengrab from report.

NowCommunities director Parveen told the participants that “employers view unions as something that is formed in opposition to them.”
She added that “even registering to form a union was extremely challenging.”
“And when they do try to unionise, they are fired,” she continued.
“According to the ITUC Global Rights Index 2024, Pakistani law lacks explicit protections against anti-union discrimination, leaving workers vulnerable to retaliation for union activities,” the report noted.
“The index ranks Pakistan among the ‘worst countries in the world to work in’, which means that while certain rights exist on paper, workers often have no real access to them, leaving them exposed to unfair labour practices,” it said.
The findings also revealed that a pattern of “overreliance on social audits”, which often failed to “detect” human rights abuses in the sector.
The report said: “factories are meticulously staged before audits take place —workspaces are cleaned, health and safety gear like masks and gloves are distributed, and banners proclaim that minimum wages are paid on time.”
However, these arrangements are only made during the audits and abandoned afterwards.
The study revealed that workers in Karachi described “how on audit days, gatekeepers bar outspoken employees from entering the factory, while entire sections may be shut down under the pretext of technical issues.”
The findings also revealed poor occupational health and safety within the factories, excessive working hours, lack of social security.
Detailing the report’s recommendations, Rehman called on the government to “align labour laws with international standards”, noting that most factory workers were not aware of the laws.
He also called for the need for women factory inspectors.
“They will see if there is discrimination against women or sexual harassment, and if the factory has a sexual harassment committee in place,” he said.
Rehman, citing the report, suggested that “it was hard for workers to lodge complaints without facing repercussions, hence some digital portal should be launched where they can report violations anonymously.”
He also noted that there was a “severe lack of available data”, stressing that the data of labour workers should be published annually.
There should be protective mechanisms for whistleblowers, the gender pay gap should be addressed, he said.
The AwazCDS-Pakistan founder called for a need for “collaboration between labour unions, federations, and NGOs” in negotiations with the state.</p><small>2025-12-18 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18213912337b534.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961860/gender-gap-among-voters-shrinks-to-71pc-from-118pc-in-2018' target='_blank'><strong>Gender gap among voters shrinks to 7.1pc from 11.8pc in 2018</strong></a><br><p>Gender gap among Pakistan’s voters reduced from 11.8 per cent in 2018 to 7.1pc in 2025, the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) Secretary Omar Hamid Khan said on Thursday.
According to the Human Rights Watch, for the February 8, 2024, elections, which saw the registration of 127 million voters, there were 10 million more men than women, showing a large gender gap in a country in which women make up 49pc of the population.
Khan shared the numbers at a board review meeting of the Pakistan Legislative, Electoral, Digital Governance and Empowerment (Pledge) project.
“Women voter registration has outpaced men’s over the past five years, with a 27pc increase in female voters as compared to 17pc for males,” Khan shared with the members of the meeting.
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Dr Samuel Rizk, Ministry of Economic Affairs Joint Secretary Mahmood Khan and representatives from the British High Commission and European Union were in attendance.
“The progress is attributed to a targeted campaign, comprised of four phases, for registration of women’s national identity card numbers and enrollment of voters,” he said, adding the fifth phase was ongoing in 62 districts where the gap exceeded 10pc.
Citing a Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) report, Khan said the ECP “adds around 7,599 new voters daily”, according to district-wise data published on its website, “with women leading the numbers”.
The UNDP would launch activities in 15 districts to support the fifth phase of the women-led voter registration campaign, starting from January 2026, through which 25,000 women would be facilitated to get their national identity cards, he said. “This would automatically enrol them as voters.”
After consultation with the stakeholders, the commission introduced the Gender Mainstreaming and Social Inclusion Framework (GMSIF), under which the ECP joined the ranks of the region’s “prominent” electoral institutions, he said.
Citing the ECP’s spokesman, Khan said the meeting took a detailed review of the progress of various projects initiated during the last year, while the proposed strategy and priorities for the year 2026 were also considered.
With the support of the UNDP, an election monitoring and control centre, equipped with modern technology, was established, where a gender desk was also active, facilitating the affected communities, he said.
An effective presence on social media was ensured for public awareness and prevention of fake news and misinformation, while informational videos in Braille, 3D content and sign language were introduced for the specially-abled, Khan said, adding an important project was launched on the role of Artificial Intelligence in the electoral process.
He further said the turnout of young voters in the 2024 general elections increased significantly as a result of thousands of awareness sessions organised across the country to involve the youth in the electoral process.
UNDP Resident Representative presented the Pledge project’s 2025 report and lauded the efforts of the ECP, saying the UNDP considered the partnership with the commission to be of utmost importance.
Under the Pledge project, the UNDP would continue its technical assistance to the commission from 2025 to 2029, he said.</p><small>2025-12-18 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18182040fd7d4f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961848/fo-contradicts-media-reports-of-cdf-field-marshal-munir-visiting-the-us-says-no-plan-finalised' target='_blank'><strong>FO ‘contradicts’ media reports of CDF Field Marshal Munir visiting the US, says no plan finalised</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi on Thursday denied reports that Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would undertake another visit to the United States soon.
Reuters reported a day ago that Field Marshal Munir was expected to fly to Washington to meet US President Donald Trump in the coming weeks for a meeting which would likely focus on the Gaza force, according to two sources, one of whom was described as a key player in the CDF’s economic diplomacy.
Andrabi’s statement came during the FO’s weekly press briefing today in response to a question, where he contradicted the Reuters report about the visit.
“The Reuters story was showing as if the visit had been planned, and there was a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that and I’m contradicting the fact that a visit has been agreed or planned,” Andrabi said.
“The fact is that this is information that I do not have, about the timing or any future visit that might take place. We obviously will wait for an official announcement that the Government of Pakistan makes about such a visit.”
Andrabi noted that official announcements are issued ahead of official visits to foreign capitals carried out by political and military leaders and maintained that he had no information about Field Marshal Munir visiting the US.
In an answer to another question about the CDF’s possible visit, the spokesperson said: “As regards the visit of the Chief of the Army Staff and the Chief of Defence Forces, I do not have any information right now. I have seen the reports, but I have no information to share with you.”
The field marshal is currently on a visit to Libya, where he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Tripoli, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
CDF Munir has visited the US three times over this year.
In June, Field Marshal Munir undertook a visit to the US and met with President Donald Trump over luncheon, marking the first time an American president had hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
In August, the army chief visited the US again and termed his visit a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. He also engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Meanwhile, in September, Field Marshal Munir, accompanied by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, visited the White House and met Trump to discuss regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism and other matters.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming, and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.</p><small>2025-12-18 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/181811455ecd225.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961850/nccia-uncovers-alleged-ponzi-network-in-karachi-detains-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA uncovers alleged Ponzi network in Karachi, detains foreign nationals</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), in a joint raid along with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, arrested several foreign nationals allegedly running a fraudulent Ponzi scheme network in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area on Thursday, a statement from the agency said.
A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a non-existent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.
Per the statement, the operation was conducted in DHA Phase 1 and Phase 6, where several foreign nationals were taken into custody during the action.
“Important and sensitive data was recovered from the suspects, which is now being examined as part of the investigation,” the statement said.
Preliminary inquiries suggest the detained individuals were allegedly running a “well-organised network through a Ponzi scheme,” the statement said, adding that the fraud had affected thousands of people, causing them “serious financial losses”.
However, the further details about the extent of the crime and the people involved were not confirmed.
Authorities said further legal action will be initiated against the network, while investigations are ongoing to determine the full scope of the operation and identify additional suspects.
In July, the NCCIA had also captured a Ponzi ring by raiding a factory in Faisalabad, arresting 149 suspects, including 48 Chinese nationals.
In Feb, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore had launched a crackdown against several entities for their involvement in financial scandals, drawing thousands of people to invest in fraudulent schemes.
The term ‘Ponzi’ scheme came from Charles Ponzi, who in the 1920s promised high returns through a fake investment system involving international postal vouchers. Instead of making legitimate investments, he paid returns to earlier investors with the money from new ones. This fraudulent model continues to thrive online today.</p><small>2025-12-18 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18130410d356760.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961829/cdf-field-marshal-munir-reaffirms-commitment-to-strengthening-defence-ties-with-libya' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirms commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
In a statement, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the field marshal was currently on an official visit to Libya, where he called on the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, and deputy commander in chief, Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar.
“On arrival, the field marshal was accorded a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Libyan Armed Forces,” the ISPR said.







In a meeting with the Libyan Armed Forces’ commander in chief, CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Libya, “based on shared interests”, it said.
It added that during the meeting, the two discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military-to-military cooperation.
“Both sides underscored the importance of collaboration in training, capacity building, and counter-terrorism domains,” it said.
“Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and expressed his desire to further expand defence cooperation between the two countries,” the ISPR statement added.
In July, Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa had called on Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, where the two had agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry.
“Both leaders agreed to undertake defence industrial collaboration and exchange of technical expertise to address contemporary security challenges,” an ISPR statement said at the time.</p><small>2025-12-18 09:06</small></div><hr>
