The 34-year-old Democrat took his oath of office at an abandoned subway stop under City Hall just after midnight to take the helm of the United States’ largest city. He will be New York’s first Muslim mayor.
His office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people, after the 34-year-old Democrat campaigned on promises to address the soaring cost of living.
NBC News reported that Mamdani took the oath with his hands on two copies of the Holy Quran — one belonging to his grandfather and the other from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Centre for Research in Black Culture.

“Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,” said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. “This is truly an honor and a privilege of a lifetime.”
He also called the ornate subway station “a testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health, and the legacy of our city”.
Mamdani’s private swearing-in to start his four-year term was performed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud. His wife, Rama Duwaji, was also present alongside him.

According to CNN, his parents, filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, were also in attendance.
A larger, ceremonial inauguration is scheduled later on Thursday with speeches from left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Around 4,000 ticketed guests are expected to attend the event outside City Hall.
Mamdani’s team has also organised a block party that it says will enable tens of thousands of people to watch the ceremony at streetside viewing areas along Broadway.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who’s in charge of America’s most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight.
Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at age seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing with only a relatively brief stint in politics, becoming a member of the New York State Assembly before being elected mayor.
He is surrounding himself with seasoned aides recruited from past mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden’s government.

 

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom predicted a massive exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have debunked those claims.
He has promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.
Mamdani had inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 per cent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><small>2026-01-01 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01115931e1db431.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964459/several-dead-in-explosion-at-swiss-ski-resort-town-police' target='_blank'><strong>Several dead in explosion at Swiss ski resort town: police</strong></a><br><p>Several people were killed and others injured when an explosion ripped through a bar in Switzerland’s luxury Alpine ski resort town of Crans Montana, police said on Thursday.
“There has been an explosion of unknown origin,” Gaetan Lathion, a police spokesman in Wallis canton in southwestern Switzerland told AFP.
“There are several injured, and several dead.”
He said the explosion took place at around 1:30am (local time) in a bar called Le Constellation, which is popular with tourists, as revellers rang in the new year.
Images published by Swiss media showed a building in flames, and emergency services nearby.
“The intervention is still ongoing,” he said.

Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve. Last year, over two dozen citizens were wounded in celebratory aerial firing
According to the information given by Edhi, a total of 28 people were brought to hospitals across the city after suffering injuries from stray bullets, with the youngest victim being 11-years-old.
Sixteen people were brought to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), including a 32-year-old man from North Nazimabad, a 16-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man from Mehmoodabad, a 24-year-old woman from Qayyumabad, and a 71-year-old man from Manzoor Colony.
An 18-year-old man from Korangi, a 24-year-old man from Azam Town, a 55-year-old man and an 18-year-old man from Saddar were also brought to the hospital. A 33-year-old woman from Gulistan-i-Johar Block 2, a 43-year-old woman from Scheme 33 in Gulzar-e-Hijri, and an 18-year-old boy from Landhi were also brought to the facility.
The six injured brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital included a 40-year-old man from Gulbahar, an 18-year-old man from Liqaquatabad, a 32-year-old man from near Pakistan Colony, a 40-year-old man from near New Sabzi Mandi, a 24-year-old man from Moosa Colony, and a 12-year-old boy from near Liaquatabad.
Four injured people were brought to Civil Hospital, including a 45-year-old man from Hub Chowki, a 25-year-old man from Lyari, a 40-year-old man from near Mauripur Road, and another 43-year-old man from Garden.
A 22-year-old man was brought to Liaquat National Hospital from Safoora, while an 11-year-old girl from Korangi was brought to the Sindh Government Hospital.
On Wednesday, Sindh police had urged citizens to refrain from aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling on New Year’s Eve. In a statement, police had also warned of strict legal action against those involved in aerial firing, calling on citizens to act responsibly.
First Lady and MNA, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, on Wednesday had also called on citizens to celebrate responsibly.
“Aerial firing costs innocent lives every year. Senseless shooting can turn moments of joy into tragedy. Be responsible and celebrate safely!” she said in a post on social media platform X.

In a post on the social media platform X on Thursday morning, the premier echoed the statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) a day earlier.
Calling it a “warm and most cordial telephone conversation”, PM Shehbaz said the two “reaffirmed our shared commitment to further strengthening the long-standing fraternal bonds between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, which have attained new heights in recent months”.
“While expressing Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the kingdom, we also exchanged views on the regional situation, emphasising the need for unity within the Ummah and maintaining regional peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said.







PM Shehbaz said he was “grateful” to the Saudi crown prince, who reaffirmed the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest and also “shared his intention to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the coming year”.
“Together, we envision an exciting and promising future for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said.
A similar statement was also issued by the PMO a day earlier, when the premier had also met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy at the Prime Minister’s House to discuss regional and global developments.
The prime minister reiterated the need to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy.
He expressed satisfaction over bilateral relations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further deepening ties, while appreciating Saudi Arabia’s support for Pakistan and its role in promoting regional peace and stability, the statement said.
The prime minister recalled his meetings with the crown prince during the year, which he said had been highly productive and contributed significantly to elevating Pak-Saudi ties to new levels.
He also expressed deep appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s consistent support to Pakistan in times of need and its constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability.
Ambassador Al-Malkiy conveyed greetings from the Saudi leadership and reiterated the kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.</p><small>2026-01-01 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01110550c9f5a32.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964455/us-military-says-8-dead-in-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats' target='_blank'><strong>US military says 8 dead in US strikes on alleged drug boats</strong></a><br><p>The US military said Wednesday that eight people were killed in multiple new strikes on alleged drug boats, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 115.
US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, announced two sets of strikes, which were carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Tuesday, “three narco-trafficking vessels traveling as a convoy” were targeted in “international waters,” it said in a statement on X.







“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.
Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing the vessels traveling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.
The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

 

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system,” without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.
Hours later, it issued a second statement about strikes on two more vessels conducted on Wednesday, killing five people. Again, it was not clear where the strikes took place.
Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.
International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.
In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of running a drug cartel.
Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</p><small>2026-01-01 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6955e6bce513c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964443/national-overview-chaos-and-order' target='_blank'><strong>National Overview: Chaos And Order</strong></a><br><p>SO much has happened, yet so little seems to have changed since the Earth last circled the sun. Where does one begin? The year 2025 was a year of profound structural shifts in Pakistan, characterised by high-stakes political brinkmanship, a radical re-engineering of the judiciary, and a desperate struggle for stabilisation amidst unrelenting economic pressures. If previous years had been defined by the despair they spawned, the year 2025 was when powerful actors decided to enforce the ‘new normal’ through force of law and arms. By the end of it, it was abundantly clear that most of the errant vectors within the structure of the state had been polarised.
Yet, the fruits of this monumental realignment of our state have yet to be seen. The outgoing year saw a modest economic recovery, amidst escalating security risks and the suffocation of civil and political liberties. Though macroeconomic indicators showed signs of stabilisation — inflation eased and foreign reserves recovered thanks to debt rollovers, increased remittances and IMF injections — the momentum needed for a meaningful, sustained recovery remained missing, giving the lie to sporadic claims of an economic turnaround from the government.
Political imbroglio
The omens were there from the start. In January, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were handed 14 and seven years, respectively, in the £190m Al Qadir Trust case. The sentencing would set the tone for the rest of 2025, with the state maintaining its hard line against the PTI, and the PTI, in return, hardening its stance and rhetoric against those it sees as responsible for its predicament.
Access to Mr Khan would in the latter half of the year become a key challenge for the PTI, especially after the party made it clear it would not be taking any decision, big or small, without his express consent and involvement. Whether this was a strategic decision taken to preclude the possibility of the much-talked-about ‘minus-one formula’, only the party’s bigwigs can tell. Whatever the rationale, it seems to have proven useful in keeping Mr Khan at the front and centre of national political discourse.

 

As in years past, the state seemed intent on demonstrating the logic of power over law, repeatedly blocking court orders, refusing the jailed ex-prime minister visitation rights or phone calls with his children, and breaking up opposition gatherings and protests with force. The heavy-handedness on display cemented the perception that the so-called ‘hybrid regime’ of yesteryear had evolved into something new, and that it now had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for political dissent.

 

Not all was hunky dory within the ruling coalition’s ranks either. A major dispute flared up early in the year between the PPP and PML-N over a proposal to irrigate the Cholistan desert. The PPP, which rules Sindh, accused the PML-N governments in the centre and Punjab of threatening the lower riparian province’s water rights. The proposal was eventually shelved. Another serious dispute arose when the PPP pushed for disbursal of relief and aid through the Benazir Income Support Programme after the devastating monsoon floods in Punjab, while the PML-N insisted on its own ‘relief card’ initiative. Matters turned ugly as the scions of both parties took jibes at each other. However, party elders intervened and the alliance remained intact, with the two parties even jointly contesting some by-elections in the latter part of the year.
Another development of note on the political front was the outlawing of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan. The far-right political party crossed one line too many by insisting on holding its ‘Gaza solidarity march’ in October, which was to start from Lahore and Faisalabad and culminate outside the US embassy in Islamabad. The state, still revelling in its newfound bonhomie with the Trump administration, would not have it, and made its intentions clear. Defying Section 144, internet suspensions, heavy policy deployment and road blockades, the TLP attempted to press ahead anyway. A violent confrontation ensued, which quickly turned deadly. The government was eventually successful in dispersing the party’s workers and arrested thousands in the ensuing crackdown. The party was officially banned by the federal cabinet on Oct 23, and its leaders remain absconding.

The fruits of this monumental realignment of our state have yet to be seen.

Judicial developments
Things were no quieter on the judicial front. The year saw profound changes to Pakistan’s judicial landscape, sparking intense debate over independence and institutional balance.
The seeds of the crisis were sown early in the year, when judges from other high courts were transferred to the Islamabad High Court. It quickly became clear that not only were the new judges being moved to ‘dilute’ the IHC’s ideological leaning, they would also displace its existing judges in the court’s seniority lists. Despite attempts to secure justice for the affected judges, the architects of this ‘reshuffle’ were ultimately successful in installing one of the transferred judges as the IHC chief justice.
And then came the kicker.
November brought with it the contentious 27th Amendment, which would completely upend the judiciary. Its enactment resulted in the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), and the reconstitution of key bodies like the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and the Supreme Judicial Council. There was considerable criticism.

 

It was not without reason: the FCC stripped the Supreme Court of its original jurisdiction over constitutional matters, fundamental rights, and federal-provincial disputes. Even more problematic was the fact that the amendment granted the president (on the prime minister’s advice) the power to appoint the first batch of FCC judges, and to authorise the transfer of high court judges across provinces without their consent. It was clear to many that the existing judiciary had been completely neutralised. The amendment led to the immediate resignation of two senior Supreme Court judges on Nov 14, who regretted the “hollowing out” of the Supreme Court in their parting letters.
Internal security
The same year, Pakistan was grappling with the severest resurgence of terrorism in over a decade. By the end of the first three quarters of 2025, Pakistan looked set to surpass the previous year’s numbers. Through the first 11 months, independent monitoring by the Centre for Research and Security Studies had established at least 3,187 fatalities from violence-related incidents, surpassing the entire 2024 total of 2,546 deaths by more than 25pc. Close to 1,200 terrorism incidents had been recorded, with security forces killing close to 1,800 terrorists in response.
Like the preceding year, most of this violence remained concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. KP bore the brunt, thanks to relentless TTP assaults on security forces in the form of ambushes, suicide bombings, and raids. Balochistan saw a parallel rise in separatist attacks, with groups targeting infrastructure, convoys and ‘non-locals’. The March hijacking of the Jaffar Express, which resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds held hostage, was the highest-profile example of terrorist violence in the outgoing year.

 

The year saw the term ‘fitna’ feature more consistently in security parlance, with ‘Fitna al-Khawarij’ and ‘Fitna al-Hindustan’ used as umbrella references to actors believed to either be affiliated with religious militants (khawarij) or foreign-backed elements (specifically, India). Introduced a year earlier, the narrative strategy seems to reflect a desire to focus the national security narrative on two hostile fronts, Afghanistan and India. Major security-related incidents were therefore categorised according to where the threat was perceived to have emanated from.
The making of a field marshal

The most perilous moment of the year arrived in May during the “Marka-i-Haq” (The Battle of Truth). Following a dastardly attack in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam region in April, New Delhi continuously blamed Pakistan — without any proof — of orchestrating the incident. The Pakistani military leadership, to its credit, was well-prepared for any misadventure. When it eventually transpired, in the form of airstrikes launched in the dead of the night under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan retaliated with a stunning counterpunch that saw multiple Indian jets shot down by the Pakistan Air Force with the help of superior tactics and technologies. That marked the start of the first high-intensity drone and missile battle between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. On May 10, Washington finally stepped into the fray, to de-escalate what the US president would later describe as imminent nuclear armageddon.

 

The imprint left by this military standoff bears a closer look. One of the most consequential decisions taken by the Pakistani leadership in the aftermath was the promotion of the then-Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, to the rank of Field Marshal. This made him only the second person in Pakistan’s history to hold the title. The move paid off in more ways than one.
The promotion seems to have been aimed at establishing FM Munir as more than just a ‘general’. Becoming the face of Pakistan’s military prowess, he seems to have successfully secured the attention of the American president. Mr Trump would later describe FM Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. The relationship between the two appears to have been cemented during their first meeting, a private lunch in Washington in June, shortly after which Pakistan would publicly nominate Mr Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

 

FM Munir was subsequently elevated further to Chief of Defence Forces of Pakistan through the 27th Amendment. The post, which abolishes the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, introduced a unified command structure across the armed forces of Pakistan, making the CDF the highest-ranking officer of the army, navy and air force combined. This has placed unprecedented power and authority in the hands of the field marshal, giving him authority in making strategic decisions on behalf of the entirety of the armed forces.
Whether this will yield more benefits, like reducing friction between Pakistan and potential military partners where it comes to strategic agreements, remains to be seen. With the Middle East in turmoil and new arrangements being shaped to ‘manage’ its affairs, Pakistan has emerged as one of the frontline players in the regional power matrix. It will seek to capitalise on this opportunity under its new CDF.
Conclusion: a hardened state
Pakistan witnessed a notable regression in civil rights in 2025, particularly in the realm of digital freedoms. It began with the enactment of more amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act to expand government powers over online content and expression. Critics argued that the vague provisions would enable further suppression of dissent, journalism, and criticism of state institutions. Protests by media organisations, and legal challenges in courts couldn’t amount to much.
As 2025 closes, Pakistan is a country with a vastly different institutional map than it had a year ago. With a newly minted field marshal and a government-friendly Constitutional Court, the state has centralised power more than at any point in the last two decades. However, with millions directly suffering amidst a simmering economic crisis and denied a voice in their future, the ‘stability’ claimed by the leadership remains a thin veneer over a nation under deep stress.
It is imperative upon the national leadership to secure a political ceasefire and chart a collective course forward. Immense resources have been expended on maintaining the status quo, even though it is clear it isn’t viable in the long term. The history of this present dispensation doesn’t offer much room for optimism, yet the desire for normalcy still survives. Perhaps 2026 will be the year it is finally realised. One can only hope for the best.</p><small>2026-01-01 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6955e55fb45a6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964441/economy-in-focus-the-limits-of-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Economy In Focus: The Limits Of Stability</strong></a><br><p>


THIS was the year of stabilisation, when Pakistan’s economy was pulled out from one of the worst bouts of instability it had ever seen; 2025 was also the year when the limits of stability were discovered.
Stability of the sort that an IMF programme brings is a strange place for any country to be. One cannot stay in that state for very long. In the case of Pakistan, an estimated 2.5 to three million new entrants enter the labour force every year and creating jobs for them is one of the biggest challenges for economic managers. Economists have estimated that a GDP growth rate of six per cent per annum is needed at a minimum to create enough jobs to productively employ all these people. That is the minimum required to keep pace with the core requirements of Pakistan’s society. Anything less and the ranks of the unemployed start to swell and with that comes widespread disaffection in society. If the trend of low growth and rising unemployment persists for a few years, the society turns into a pressure cooker.

 

Pakistan teetered on this edge all through 2025. The economy had just emerged from one of the biggest bouts of instability it had ever seen in its history. An inflationary fire raged from 2021 all through 2023, reaching a historic peak of 38pc year-on-year in May of that year before tapering off all through 2024. Foreign exchange reserves hit near default levels in the summer of 2022 and remained at that level until an emergency bailout from the IMF in July 2023, which pulled the country away from the edge of catastrophe. They remained around $12 billion till the opening months of 2025 when they began to climb slowly, recovering to a level sufficient to pay for 2.5 months of imports only in the second half of the year.
Both hallmarks of the extended post-Covid crisis that gripped Pakistan’s economy — inflation and foreign exchange reserve depletion — were overcome in 2025. This was the year stability took root and the economy turned the corner out of what was decidedly one of the gravest crises it had ever been through. At the start of the year the current account was registering strong surpluses, reaching $2.1bn by June 2025, what the IMF described as “Pakistan’s first surplus in 14 years”. This helped lift foreign exchange reserves to above two months of import cover after many years, and put it on course to hit the projected level of 2.7 months of import cover by the middle of 2026.

Two critical catastrophes were averted — default and inflation. But the problems had not been solved.

Inflation also receded in 2025. Having hit a peak of 38pc in May 2023, the fire died down by the end of 2024 to reach single digits. At the opening of 2025 inflation was at an all-time low of less than 1pc before starting to rise again and hit 6pc by year end. The most ferocious inflationary fire that ever raged in Pakistan’s history was finally extinguished, and 2025 was the first full year when the economy saw low inflation since Covid.
Two critical catastrophes were finally averted — default and inflation. But the problems had not been solved.
This feat, of stabilising the economy, was achieved the same way it had always been done: with an IMF programme that immediately choked off all growth. GDP growth fell to around 3pc and according to the IMF programme signed in late 2024, it cannot revive much beyond that level for at least another two years, while the programme is still on and in its immediate aftermath.
And therein lay the most critical problem facing the government and the economy. Inflation was doused and default was averted by extinguishing growth, which killed the demand for imports and brought down the trade deficit, and threw the current account into surplus. The State Bank ran up high interest rates in preceding years, cutting them slowly as inflation fell but stopped once they hit 11pc, drawing howls of protest from the business community. And the tax effort was ramped up.

 

Business was now reeling beneath the weight of high taxes and high interest rates. All year this state of affairs continued with no relief in sight. By the time 2025 ended the prospects for growth still seemed remote but the outline of how the government intends to pull itself out of this quagmire began to take shape.
The May war with India had sent a strong signal to countries around the world that Pakistan had built able defences for itself, and done so using Chinese technology. In the second half of the year countries began lining up to ask if Pakistan could help build such defences for them as well. A defence agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia and towards the end of 2025 the President of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also came to Pakistan for a trip that was in large part official, and in small part personal. And the privatisation of PIA later in the year heralded not just the restart of the privatisation programme that had been stalled since 2005. The participation of Fauji Fertiliser Company in the consortium that bought out the airline signalled an interest in the military to start acquiring stakes in the economy.
Following the departure of Sheikh Zayed, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that an agreement has been reached on a debt equity swap where the UAE will accept shares of companies owned by the Fauji Foundation in return for its $1bn deposit that is set to mature in March of 2026. The outlines of how growth could be restarted had begun to appear. A new model of public-private ownership of large assets in sectors like infrastructure, minerals and others is likely going to be used to either attract direct investment from bilateral partners, or undertake more debt equity swaps against the deposits placed in Pakistan’s central bank by Gulf countries.
The year 2025 was when the tide turned in the economy. Pakistan suddenly found a new place in the eyes of important countries around the world following its performance in the May war against India, and leveraged this to put in place bilateral partnerships that its government began using to help underwrite its transition from stabilisation to growth. In short, 2025 was the year when a new opportunity for a geopolitical rent dawned on the country and a path out of a crippling stabilisation programme began to open up.
Depending on how the government plays its cards in the first few months of the new year, the transition to growth could come about in 2026. And in the process, the shape of Pakistan’s economy could undergo a profound structural transformation, just not of the sort that reform-minded economists have been calling for.</p><small>2026-01-01 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964423/the-year-ahead' target='_blank'><strong>The year ahead</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN enters 2026 with problems it is well aware of but has failed to resolve. Three alarm bells in particular are sounding off: resurgent terrorism, economic fragility, and a steady squeeze on fundamental rights.
None of these is new. What is new is the growing sense that the state is treating each as a problem to be managed, not solved, and that habit is becoming unaffordable.
Terrorism remains the most immediate danger. Suicide bombings on police and security installations in Bannu and North Waziristan, the deadly blast near Islamabad’s district courts, and continuing violence in Balochistan demonstrated the capacity of terrorist networks. These incidents showed how violence is no longer geographically contained, nor confined to symbolic targets.

 

Yet our counterterrorism efforts value force rather than reform. Policing capacity, prosecution, local governance and political engagement in conflict-affected districts remain weak. Unless these gaps are addressed, 2026 risks becoming another year in which attacks are condemned, investigations announced and root causes ignored.
The economy presents a slower-burning crisis. The sale of a majority stake in PIA was hailed as a major breakthrough after decades of delay. It also highlighted how rare decisive action has become. One transaction, however, cannot substitute for the harder work of broadening the tax net, fixing other loss-making state enterprises, and building credibility through predictable policy. Without that, 2026 risks repeating the cycle of short-term fixes, periodic external support, and long stretches of stagnation.
The more corrosive issue is the steady narrowing of civic space. Over the past year, prolonged internet shutdowns, restrictions on public assembly, pressure on journalists, and legal action against dissenting voices became routine. Media outlets faced censorship, digital platforms were blocked, and human rights organisations reported intimidation and administrative obstruction.

 

Such measures may silence criticism, but they also weaken accountability and deepen public mistrust, especially among younger citizens already sceptical of political institutions. A state that relies on control rather than consent reduces its own capacity to govern and invites the very instability it claims to prevent.
Institutions will therefore matter greatly in 2026. Parliament must reclaim its role as a forum for debate where laws are scrutinised before enforcement, not justified after the fact, and committees are allowed to function without pressure or haste. The judiciary must demonstrate consistency and independence, not selective urgency, by upholding due process without fear or favour.
Economic decisions need clarity, consistency and equal application if confidence is to return. Security policy, meanwhile, must rest on civilian authority rather than a permanent sense of emergency. And the executive must accept that order imposed through coercion is fragile and short-lived. The country has tried control time and again. It should now try governance.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May was among the contentious matters mediated by Beijing in 2025.
India has repeatedly rejected claims made by US President Donald Trump that Washington had mediated the ceasefire.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs has not reacted to the claim made by Mr Wang. But it has maintained that the ceasefire with Islamabad was not the result of mediation. The decision to stop the firing was taken after the Pakistani director general of military operations had called his Indian counterpart, New Delhi has said.
“China’s claims of mediating betw­een India and Pakistan are concerning — not just because they contradict what has been told to the country’s people so far, but also because they appear to mock our national security,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a social media post.
Mr Wang was commenting on China’s role in a tricky world. “This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII [World War II],” Mr Wang said at a conference on China’s foreign relations in Beijing. “Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread.”
To build lasting peace, “we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes”, the Chinese minister added.
“Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he claimed.

It is not just about my own health — though my waistline surely needs it. It is a stand against habits that are quietly bleeding Pakistan dry. Sweet milky tea, sugary sweets and ghee-drenched parathas are everyday comforts that cost us over $4 billion for edible oils, $600 million for tea, and significant subsidies and spikes for sugar. They fuel our shocking 31.4 per cent diabetes rate, the highest in the world. And as climate-triggered disasters ravage us again, we see their hidden climate toll. What was once warmth and hospitality has become a national vulnerability. It is time to face facts and find fixes.
Our consumption pattern: Pakistanis drink a lot of tea. At 1.5 kilogram per person annually, we rank sixth globally — more than twice India’s rate. That is four to five cups daily in most homes, loaded with sugar and milk. We consume over 25kg of sugar per head yearly, much of it in chai and mithai. Additionally, a major share comes from juices, sodas, confectionaries and bakery products. Over the last decade, this has caused our import bill to explode. Total edible oil imports exceeded $4bn in 2024, with those high in saturated fat alone accounting for nearly $3bn. To grasp the scale: this exceeds Rs1,100bn that is nine times Pakistan’s combined federal budgets for education and health, and over 100 times what the treasury received from the PIA privatisation.

 

The combined import bill for tea and edible oils has surged over 40pc in five years. If consumption and population growth remain unchecked, this could hit $7bn annually by 2030, entrenching the ‘triple burden’ permanently. This is money we cannot spare when climate catastrophes wipe out billions every few years.
Health-planet nexus: Our consumption habits assault both human health and planetary systems in parallel. The saturated fats in ghee and trans fats in cheap vanaspati drive up bad cholesterol, making heart disease the leading cause of death. We rank first globally for diabetes prevalence, with nearly 30pc of adults hypertensive. The sugar in our chai often exceeds 60 grams daily. It fuels diabetes in one in three adults. These non-communicable diseases drain our GDP as families spend heavily on medical tests, pills and doctors, a burden worsened for the poor by widespread adulteration of unpackaged, loosely sold ghee and fake tea. The economic toll is staggering: NCDs cost Pakistan an estimated 2-3pc of GDP annually in lost productivity alone.

Our consumption habits assault both human health and planetary systems.

These same habits devastate our ecosystems. Sugarcane dominates 1.5m hectares (3.7m acres) of irrigated land, straining the Indus even as freshwater flows shrink. This expansion occurs at cotton’s expense that generates far greater export earnings per acre. Sugarcane’s 2,000-litre-per-kilogram water demand depletes aquifers that should irrigate wheat. While cotton strengthens our industrial base, sugarcane thrives through a ‘playbook of distortion’ where mill owners secure near-free irrigation water, instead of paying a water-use levy based on cane procured that would internalise water costs into sugar pricing, thereby reducing reliance on subsidies.
Governance failures: Evidently, Pakistan’s sugar, tea and edible oil sectors share a common playbook where artificial price supports and export quotas create shortages despite ample supply, while the dysfunctionality of oversight bodies enable smuggling and adulteration. In the sugar sector, operational mills benefit from near-free irrigation water. In the tea sector, the absence of the Pakistan Tea Board (defunct) enables annual smuggling losses via Afghan transit while some elite importers allegedly block local plantations through lobbying. Similarly, in the ghee sector, waivers sustain high margins despite global price drops, and loose ghee evades health regulations and enforcement. Collectively, these networks are believed to misallocate over $4.6bn in annual forex, entrench elite capture and corruption at public expense.

 

These distortions amplify Pakistan’s climate risks, particularly in flood-prone sugar belts. The governance failure extends into the climate crisis, where the sugar elite has mastered the art of turning climate-triggered disasters into profit. While the 2022 and 2025 floods devastated smallholders, destroying up to 61pc of yields in some districts, the sector paradoxically saw an export boom and value increase of over 20pc. By leveraging flood-induced local shortages to justify stockpiling and price spikes, politically wired millers ensure their unquestioned profits. This systemic capture not only sidelines high-value crops like cotton but also entrenches a water-intensive monoculture that leaves Pakistan increasingly vulnerable to the very climate shocks these elites allegedly exploit for gain.
Cultural tradition: The Indus Valley civilisation knew sugarcane and produced gur for millennia, but today’s industrial sugar dominance is recent. Pakistan’s culinary past offers alternatives our grandmothers understood instinctively: carrying both ceremony and wellness. The path to breaking this ‘triple burden’ lies in dismantling the vertical integration and regulatory capture that have turned our kitchens into profit centres for the elite. We must move to shed the entire ecosystem of ‘fried and sweet’ consumption. A critical first step is to tax high-sugar beverages and industrial trans-fats, with revenues ring-fenced to fund public health awareness.
Finally, we must internalise the true cost of production by replacing near-free irrigation for sugar with a water-use levy that reflects our national scarcity. This would naturally pivot the agricultural economy back towards cotton and pulses. These crops build industrial capacity and food security instead of draining water for elite mills. Switching to canola and sunflower, which require far less water and yield per hectare in saline lands, could help cut import reliance and reduce our carbon footprint, and ease pressure on drying aquifers. Breaking this cycle requires more than technical policy; it requires the rejection of a governance model that leverages climate disasters like the 2025 floods to justify stockpiling and price spikes.
My promise to cut back on chai, cheeni, and ghee is a personal refusal to fund these cartels. My first plain chai tomorrow is small, but it’s a start. Policymakers, join me. Turn this burden into strength. Our people — and our planet — deserve it.

Yet she commanded stature and could dominate a room full of people simply by being in it. It was the quiet authority she exuded that was her signature, the kind that seeks no validation from anyone. She steered Pakistan’s financial system through one of its most critical tests ever: the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, as governor of the State Bank at the time. And in doing so, she developed the template that was used by her successors more than a decade later.
The economy had been drifting towards crisis since 2006, when she came into the position of governor. She had already made history as the first woman governor of the State Bank, but little did she know that she would be called upon to make history one more time in dealing with the crisis coming her way. Pakistan’s foreign exchange rese­r­­ves were depleting fast, at an accelerating clip, and inflation was rising. In two years, the inflationary fire reached historic levels, and the rese­rve depletion brought the country’s financial system to the brink of a full-fledged run on the banks.

 

The financial sector had changed by the time this crisis arrived. In 1997, for example, total financial sector assets were around 95 per cent of GDP. By 2007, they had risen to 125pc. Equally important, most of this lay in private hands. And on the margins of the big banks and capital markets, a slew of smaller players operated — insurance companies, non-bank financial institutions, smaller banks that had escaped the merger and acquisition drive of the 2000s, listed private bonds, and so on. Financial risk had taken complex forms with these changes, and improving banking supervision and surveillance had become critical tasks.
Akhtar focused hard on the sources of risk and their propagation channels, and worked to develop a surveillance regime as well as upgrade regulatory requirements to shore up the resilience of banks against possible crises. To do this, she worked to identify risks to financial institutions, markets as well as infrastructure. The system faced wide-ranging risks along multiple fronts as it evolved out of public sector hands into private ownership, and strengthening banks’ capital adequacy in addition to the regulators’ visibility of systemic risk was becoming increasingly critical.

Had it not been for the deft balancing act she performed in those months, Pakistan’s inflation would have peaked far higher than it did.

Her efforts bore fruit in the year 2008, when the Great Financial Crisis engulfing the world finally landed in earnest on Pakistan’s shores. The financial system was hit by a wave of withdrawals so severe that it created a crisis that the country had never seen before: a full-fledged banking sector collapse. A number of developments began to unfold simultaneously. Widespread dollarisation began in 2007 as reserves fell and the current account deficit swelled. One devaluation in November 2007 triggered a flight into dollars, which accelerated all through 2008. Second, non-performing loans of the banking system began to skyrocket in the early months of 2008, reaching levels equal to what they were in the pre-privatisation days. Third, by the summer of 2008, banks stopped bidding for government debt paper in anticipation of an interest rate hike, forcing the State Bank to print more money to finance runaway government spending on subsidies that the Musharraf regime was unwilling to withdraw in the face of mounting challenges to the general’s rule. Fourth, a global price spiral in oil and wheat was placing unprecedented strain on the country’s external account, sending the trade deficit skyrocketing and draining foreign reserves further still.
A near-perfect storm was brewing until then, but it was completely overshadowed by the stormy political developments of the day. The economy did not stand a chance in competing for the headlines in days when the Lal Masjid crisis and the lawyers’ movement were roaring ahead.
By the summer of 2008, the perfect storm began to take shape. Dollarisation gave way to dollar flight. Banks were hit by panic-driven withdrawals of rupee liquidity so severe that the weaker among them began to shake under the strain. The government’s fiscal crisis worsened and printing of rupees accelerated. The crisis landed in the first week of October, when Eid-related cash withdrawals from the banking system combined with panic withdrawals sent at least four banks into a liquidity crisis.
The real story of those days needs to be told properly. Four owners of small banks showed up in the office of Governor Akhtar to inform her that their banks were hit by withdrawals they could no longer honour. The interbank lending window had shut down. In short, a run on the banks had begun.
Akhtar knew that the banking system needed strengthening all along. It was the steps that she had taken earlier in her tenure, building on the work of her predecessor Ishrat Husain, that helped the banks weather the intense liquidity crisis they faced in 2008. But vulnerability remained when a few smaller banks were unable to sustain themselves in the face of the severe strains they were facing. And this is precisely how banking systems face total collapse, when the weakest among them fails, panic spreads, and soon everyone starts seeing panic-driven withdrawals.
Akhtar managed this situation, trying to prevent a fully-fledged financial meltdown while at the same time trying to prevent, as far as was possible, the full impact of the crisis hitting the common citizenry in the form of inflation. Had it not been for the deft balancing act she performed in those months, Pakistan’s inflation would have peaked far higher than it did, at 25pc.
This was the first test of Pakistan’s new, post-privatisation financial system. And Akhtar was the captain of the fleet who navigated them all through the choppiest waters they had ever traversed. She was a steady hand on the tiller, a firm captain of her will and a resolute central banker who put duty above ambition. May she rest in eternal peace.

ISLAMABAD: With security taking precedence over democracy, year 2025 was characterised by consolidation and normalisation of the hybrid governance model rather than its disruption. While the democratic institutions are intact in form, their functioning has become increasingly constrained by a security-driven governance paradigm.
This has been observed in an Assessment of the Quality of Democracy in Pakistan 2025, released by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on the last day of an eventful year. The security-driven environment, particularly since the brief but intense Pakistan-India armed conflict in May 2025, has further entrenched the security establishment’s influence over all matters, including democratic institutions and governance in Pakistan.
This “hybrid” model has the full endorsement of the civilian government, which inc­reasingly views democracy through the lens of state survival. Regional security de­­vel­opments, including tensions with India and Afghanistan, alongside persistent inte­rnal insurgencies and intense political pola­ri­sa­tion, have all contributed to Pakistan’s reversion to becoming a security-centric state.
Pildat notes that rather than strengthening civilian institutions, the role of “hybrid” entities such as the SIFC continued to expand, which operate outside conventional ministerial and parliamentary oversight structures.
At the same time, the appointment of serving and retired military officers to civilian administrative posts, including the appointment of a serving major general to a key interior ministry position in August 2025, also blur the boundary between civilian governance and security institutions.
The Pildat assessment highlights that 2025 marked the institutionalisation of a hybrid governance model in which democratic institutions operate within parameters increasingly defined by security threats and priorities as they now override democratic norms and principles.
27th Amendment
Highlighting some key institutional developments during 2025, Pildat report says the parliament passed the consequential 27th Constitutional Amendment with limited debate and consensus. It observed that parliamentary representativeness and oversight were also weakened by continuing vacancies in the offices of Leader of the Opposition in both houses. Executive authority remained formally civilian but substantively constrained. The prime minister and defence minister’s statements regarding governing in collaboration with the establishment exemplified the formalisation of the hybrid model.
Judiciary experienced significant structural changes during 2025 as the constitutional amendment created a new Federal Constitutional Court, continued operation of military courts for civilians as well as high-profile accountability proceedings conduc­ted under exceptional conditions collecti­vely raised concerns regarding due process.
The security establishment’s role in natio­­nal decision-making became even more pro­m­­inent after major terrorist incidents, continued instability along the western border, and the India-Pakistan confrontation in 2025.
Restructuring
This was reflected in the restructuring of the military command through constitutional amendment, the elevation of the chief of army staff (COAS) to the rank of field marshal and increasing commentary by representatives of security institutions on governance and political issues.
The COAS was formally notified to the ad­­ditional role of chief of defence forces (CDF) in December 2025. Later, his term as COAS-cum-CDF was extended till December 2030, with the possibility of another extension till 2035.
In practice, the security sector operated with limited parliamentary oversight in 2025. The civilian government openly embraced a hybrid governance model, publicly endorsing joint civilian-military decision-making. By late 2025, the military establishment was also increasingly vocal in commenting on governance failures.
In November, the DG ISPR described lack of governance in certain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as partially responsible for resurgence of terror attacks. A month earlier, the DG ISPR had warned against bringing in “anti-state” political leadership in KP. This increasingly open participation in governance and political discourse also reflected formalisation of the hybrid model.
This hybrid model was reflected in the prominent role of the field marshal in both governance and diplomacy. He was present at events such as the Mineral Investment Forum 2025 in April and held exclusive meetings with various foreign dignitaries — including US President Trump in June, whom he then again met with the prime minister by his side in September 2025.
It referred to the court martial and sentencing to 14 years’ rigorous imprisonment of former DG of ISI, retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, saying it marked an unprecedented accountability action within the security establishment.

The draft policy estimates Pakis­tan’s annual vaccine requirement at 125 to 150 million doses in 2024-25 and suggests multi-year contra­cts of up to 10 years to reduce inves­tment risks and cut reliance on imports.
Prepared by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), the policy was finalised on Wednesday at meeting of a high-level committee formed by the prime minister.







Chairing the meeting, its chairman, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, announced that the policy would be forwarded to the premier for approval and implementation.

Proposes creating an alliance; draft will be forwarded to prime minister for approval

The meeting was co-chaired by Federal Minister for National Health Services Mustafa Kamal.
On capacity, the draft notes that Pakistan currently has only three vaccine manufacturing facilities: the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, Amson Vaccines and Pharma in Islamabad, and Dow University in Karachi.
Only one private facility produces limited vaccines, such as tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B, and it is not WHO-prequalified, restricting market access.

 

The NIH’s infrastructure is largely limited to small-scale fill-and-finish operations and would require major upgrades for end-to-end manufacturing.
To build capacity, the policy proposes a phased approach, starting with fill-and-finish operations, followed by technology transfer or joint ventures, and eventually full upstream production.
It acknowledges that WHO prequalification can take more than five years and prioritises meeting domestic needs first.
Around 40 different vaccines are administered in the country, of which 13 are included in the Expanded Programme on Immu­ni­sation (EPI).
However, due to the lack of local production, all vaccines are impor­ted, including some from India.
Guiding principles
The policy lays out guiding principles for developing local vaccine manufacturing to strengthen natio­nal health security, achieve self-suf­ficiency, enhance pandemic preparedness, and create a sustainable do­­mestic market with export potenti­­al. For FY 2025–26, the government will contribute 49 per cent of vacci­­ne costs, while Gavi will cover 51pc.
Pakistan is expected to enter the accelerated transition phase by 2030, followed by a five- to eight-year path to full self-financing.
The policy warns that reduced subsidies will increase pressure on public finances at a time when vaccine-preventable diseases remain a challenge.
To address these risks, it propo­ses establishing a National Vaccine Alliance under the Ministry of National Health Services as a coordination platform to guide investment and avoid duplication.
The alliance would include representatives from Drap, the pharmaceutical industry, public-sector manufacturers, the Federal Direc­torate of Immunisation, the Public Procurement Regulatory Autho­ri­­ty, academic institutions, development partners, and the Board of Investment.
Under its proposed mandate, the alliance would recommend buy-back guarantees or long-term procurement mechanisms, facilitate access to domestic and export markets, propose financing tools such as vaccine innovation funds and advance market commitments, and advise on regulatory reforms and incentive structures. The policy identifies high entry costs and the absence of sovereign procurement guarantees as the main barriers to local vaccine manufacturing.
Under the proposed buy-back framework, the draft calls for amendments to procurement rules to prioritise locally produced, non-WHO-prequalified vaccines once they pass lot release testing.
It proposes framework contracts of up to 10 years, with prices and volumes indexed to import parity benchmarks and efficiency targets.
Long-term contracts would be tied to technology transfer milestones, requiring manufacturers to move from fill-and-finish operations to full-scale production within the contract period.

KARACHI: Although police have claimed a significant reduction in the overall crime rate for the outgoing year, muggers, carjackers and mobilephone snatchers continue to haunt Karachiites in 2025, with official figures showing over 64,000 street crime incidents and more than 70 deaths resulting from these crimes.
The precise figure of 64,323 incidents is based on the number of FIRs registered during the outgoing year. However, the actual number of street crimes is believed to be much higher as there are a large number of victims who have either been turned away by the police or have chosen not to visit a police station to register a case of looting.
According to comparative street crime data of Karachi maintained by the police, a total of 64,323 incidents of street crimes — robbery, cell phone snatching, vehicle snatching / theft — have been reported in the outgoing year of 2025 as compared to a total 71,105 such incidents in 2024, showing a reduction of 6,782 street crimes.
The data show a total of 70 people were killed and 290 wounded by street criminals till the first week of December 2025, whereas in 2024 a total of 99 people were gunned down and 400 others injured by robbers.
The police say that during the same period of 12 months, a total of 17,706 mobile phones were snatched at gunpoint while during corresponding period in 2024, a total of 19,353 cell phones were snatched.
The police data say that 6,683 vehicles (302 cars and 6,381 motorcycles) were hijacked at gunpoint in 2025 as compared to 8,370 of last year.
As many as 39,934 vehicles (1,813 cars and 38,121 motorbikes) were stolen as compared to 43,382 vehicles of last year.
Analysis by expert
Analyst Dr Zoha Waseem, who teaches criminology at the University of Warwick, UK, and has done extensive research on policing and crimes in the metropolis, believes that a comparison of just two years is not a good benchmark as at least five- or 10-year data is required to assess whether crimes have been prevented or only a perception of “safe city” has developed.
She says there is no better data collection as all incidents are not reported because people still do not like to approach police.
She opines that maybe only half of the total cases are being reported as there is no estimation about unreported number of cases in the metropolis.
Dr Waseem says there is no study or research to assess people’s perception about police or state as to whether any improvement has occurred in the public perception.
“There has been no research that public perception has been improved and people feel safer and the city as safe,” Dr Waseem says.
“There is no study or survey that people’s perception has improved and the people are happy about performance of the police or the government. I have not seen such thing and I am not sure about the extent of achievement of the law enforcers,” she says, adding: “But if there is a trend that over a period of time, the number of crimes has gone down, then you could say they are doing good job.”
Carjacking ‘declines’ due to use of technology
Citizens-Police Liaison Commission (CPLC) Chief Zubair Habib opines that snatching of vehicles and cell phones is on decline partly because of use of technology (installation of CCTV cameras). As with the use of this technology, the criminals are being detected and arrested, he adds.
Mr Habib suggests that the way forward for controlling crimes, despite rising unemployment and closure of factories and migration of people to Dubai or other countries, lies in utilisation of technology.
Another major step that needs to be taken pertains to improving “Thana culture”, he adds.
He says that the Thana culture should be turned into service oriented.
As the use of technology has “ended” the “corruption” of traffic police through e-challan system, such technology should also be used at the police stations to end corruption of the police, he suggests.
IGP takes pride in crime reduction
Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn that there is an overall reduction in crime despite significant challenges.
He says this achievement has been made “despite severe socio-economic challenges, including inflation, unemployment, urban migration, and population growth”.
Regarding street crimes in Karachi, the IG says this crime has also been “contained”.
“Karachi is witnessing a stabilisation and gradual containment and reduction in street crime in 2025, preventing escalation despite economic stress and population growth,” says the top cop of Sindh.
“The daily average street crimes has declined from 1.36 per day in the year 2024 to 1.04 per day in the year 2025.” He says “violent robberies” have also been kept under check.
“The incidents of robbery with murder and injury have remained contained and closely monitored, with 70 fatalities and 290 injuries recorded during the year 2025 as compared to 99 fatalities and 400 injuries during the year 2024.”
The IGP cites a host of steps behind the reduction in street crimes. He says that the police are focused on operations against armed gangs and habitual offenders, which has helped prevent “a wider spike in violent crime”. Besides, targeted and intelligence-led policing has also been initiated, he adds.
He says that the police have emphasised data-driven deployments, snap checking, weapons recovery, and repeat offender tackling, which have delivered “tangible results in high-crime corridors”.

He hoped that the concerns of the telecom industry would be addressed and the spectrum would be offered under favourable terms during the auction.







Mr Bamatraf was addressing a press conference with the management of Telenor Pakistan, where they formally anno­unced PTCL’s acquisition of 100pc of Telenor Pakistan’s issued share capital and Orion Towers for Rs108bn.
Unresolved $800m issue
The PTCL CEO did not comment on the unresolved issue regarding the $800 million withheld by Etisalat since 2006, when the UAE-based company took control of PTCL. The Pakistani government still holds 62pc of PTCL’s shares, with the remaining 38pc divided between Etisalat (26pc) and public investors (12pc).
Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers are now fully owned subsidiaries of PTCL, alongside Pak Telecom Mobile Ltd (Ufone) and U Micr­ofinance Bank. Telenor Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate legal entity for the next 5-6 months before integrating with Ufone as a merged entity (Mer­geCo), subject to approval from the Pakistan Telecomm­unication Authority (PTA) and the Islamabad High Court.
Mr Bamatraf said the merged company would optimise spectrum reso­urces, expand network capabilities, and deliver seamless, secure, digitally enabled services aligned with Pakistan’s digital ambitions.
He also assured Telenor Pakistan employees that there would be no job losses due to the merger, emphasising respect for talent and the integration of industry best practices.
Following PTCL’s acquisition of Telenor Pakistan, the merged entity, which includes Ufone, will become the country’s second-largest telecom operator, with approximately 35pc of the subscriber base. Jazz Pakistan will remain the market leader with 37pc, while Zong will retain its position as the third-largest operator.
Acting CEO
In another development, the newly formed board of Telenor Pakistan appointed Awais Vohra as acting CEO.
Mr Vohra, a founding member of Telenor Pakistan’s launch team, was previously the company’s Chief Technology Officer. Telenor Pakistan, now an autonomous subsidiary of PTCL, completed all necessary regulatory approvals to finalise the acquisition.
PTA annual report
The Pakistan Teleco­mmunication Auth­ority’s Annual Report 2024-25 shows telecom revenues exceeding Rs1 trillion, up 12pc year-on-year. Subs­cribers crossed 200 million, broadband users topped 150m, and coverage exceeded 92pc. Fiscal contributions rose to Rs402bn, while investment reached $838m. Data usage surged to 27,727 petabytes. However, PTA official Naveed Butt said high electricity costs and dollar-linked government payments continue to strain operators despite revenue growth.

This is the third time the police have used force to break up the sit-in outside the prison. Imran’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan, and Noreen Niazi, besides scores of supporters, have been staging weekly protests outside the jail to demand a meeting with Mr Khan.

TTAP says struggle to continue despite govt ‘heavy-handedness’

Videos shared by the PTI Punjab account on the social media platform X after 1am showed water cannons targeting protesters. “In the severe cold, an attack with water cannons was carried out on unarmed, peaceful children, women, and citizens,” the X post said.







In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan condemned the use of water cannons and the arrest of Imran’s sisters and other PTI workers. The police, in a late-night operation, used water cannon to disperse the protesters and also arrested the sisters. However, they were later released near Chakri on the motorway.
In its statement, the opposition alliance alleged that the water used to scatter the PTI supporters was laced with a chemical and hundreds of supporters were “badly affected”. The TTAP spokesperson said that such tactics would not deter them from their stance that the violation of basic human rights should be stopped. They will continue the struggle, the statement added.
On the other hand, the PTI shared another list of six persons with the Adiala Jail administration, requesting it to allow them to meet Imran Khan on Thursday. The letter, written to the Adiala jail superintendent and signed by Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, mentioned Dr Amjad, Sibghatullah, Usman Bhattani, Jamal Khan, Iqbal Khattak, and Shoaib Ameer Awan.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 has mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the court order was not being complied with.

Terrorist attacks went down by almost 17 per cent in December, preceded by 9pc decline in November. Terrorist violence-linked fatalities among civilians and security officials also fell in the last quarter of 2025, by nearly 4pc and 19pc each in November and December, shows data collected by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of its annual security report 2025.

 

With an almost 34pc surge in overall violence, the year 2025 went by as the most violent year for Pakistan in a decade, says the report. The country has suffered a sustained escalation in violence for five consecutive years since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan; with almost 38pc in 2021, over 15pc in 2022, 56pc in 2023, nearly 67pc in 2024, and 34pc in 2025.
The comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveals a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2555 in 2024 to 3417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34pc year-on-year surge in violence.

CRSS report says most significant surge in violence recorded in KP

The most significant surge in violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the fatalities rose from 1620 in 2024 to 2331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.
Balochistan also had an upward trend, with fatalities increasing from 787 to 956; an additional 169 deaths, which are nearly 22pc higher than the previous year’s figures.
Regional impact of violence
Violence remained heavily concentrated in the country’s northwestern KP and southwestern Balochistan provinces, with both accounting for over 96pc of all fatalities and almost 93pc of violent incidents recorded during the entire 2025.
KP was the worst-hit region, suffering over 68pc (2331) of the total violence-linked fatalities, and around 63pc (795) of the incidents of violence, followed by Balochistan, accounting for 28pc (956) of the fatalities and over 30pc (386) of the incidents of violence.

 

In contrast, Punjab and Sindh experienced comparatively lower levels of violence. The former recorded 25 incidents of violence resulting in 40 fatalities and 24 injuries, representing just 1.15pc of total casualties, while the latter saw 51 incidents causing 56 fatalities and 40 injuries; 1.73pc of the total.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory though incidents numbers remained minimal, the injury figures were relatively high, with the former recording 103 injuries, and the latter registering 38, from just five incidents at each location.
Gilgit-Baltistan remained the least affected region. Compared to last year, though small in absolute numbers, the region recorded a four-fold increase from one to four fatalities.

Basant is returning to Lahore after 18 years, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025 by the provincial assembly on December 24.
So far, only the Lahore deputy commissioner has notified the three-day festival starting on February 6, 2026, while deputy commissioners in other districts were expected to follow suit.
However, the 46th Cabinet Committee on Law and Order — chaired by Khawaja Salman Rafique — met at the Punjab Home Department today and noted that Basant would be celebrated only in Lahore and on a limited scale.
Though there was no need for all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to be present at the meeting, sources in the Home Department told Dawn that they were specially invited to attend via video link, particularly for the “Basant agenda”.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told the cabinet committee meeting, “The provincial cabinet had allowed limited Basant on February 6, 7 and 8 in Lahore only,” adding that kite-flying would remain completely banned elsewhere in the province under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
A divisional commissioner, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that an official informed the meeting that Basant would not be allowed across the district.
The Home Department had held several meetings on the revival of Basant and discussed permitting the festival at specific locations or at specially notified rooftops, both in the Walled City and elsewhere in the district.
The department had also instructed all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to begin registering twine and kite manufacturers ahead of Basant.
Meanwhile, the divisional commissioner said the government was piloting Basant in Lahore, calling it an opportunity for citizens to demonstrate responsibility and adherence to instructions, a move that could lead to the festival’s revival on a larger scale.
“People should watch their neighbourhoods and ensure that no illegality is committed and that no one is injured … in the best interest of the Basant festival,” he said.
Expressing apprehension, the commissioner noted that any serious accident during the festival could lead to Basant being banned for good.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed buses and rickshaws on city roads to offer free rides and minimise the use of motorcycles in Lahore. The government may employ buses from city colleges and universities during the three-day festival.
Eventually, the Home Department wrote to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and senior police officers in the province regarding incidents of kite flying and injuries caused by stray kite twines on Wednesday, seeking action against those involved in the activity in violation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
The home department has expressed concern in the letter about illegal kite flying observed in certain parts of the province. It stated that incidents were being reported in which passersby had been injured.
In the letter, the department said, “such practices pose a serious threat to human life and public safety,” adding that action could be taken against violators, including the arrest of kite fliers and the manufacturers and suppliers of kite flying material, in accordance with the law.
The meeting also instructed authorities to adopt foolproof security arrangements for New Year’s Eve, besides taking strict action against those involved in aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling.
Additionally, the meeting approved the extension of the deployment of Rangers in Mianwali, Attock, and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Kite flying has been the cause of multiple injuries and fatalities across the province, usually caused by kite strings coated with chemicals or glass, or made from metal.
Last Saturday, a six-year-old girl was injured by a kite string near Adda Maan on Ganda Singh Road, within the jurisdiction of the Saddar Police Station.
The victim was riding on the front of a motorcycle with her brother when a chemical-coated twine slashed her throat. She was immediately rushed to the DHQ Hospital for medical treatment.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/01074904b18ecf5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964303/petrol-price-slashed-by-rs1028-diesel-by-rs857-for-next-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol price slashed by Rs10.28, diesel by Rs8.57 for next fortnight</strong></a><br><p>The government on Wednesday slashed the rates for petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs10.28 and Rs8.57, respectively, for the coming fortnight.
In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot petrol price was reduced to Rs253.17 per litre from its previous price of Rs263.45. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Meanwhile, the ex-depot price of HSD was decreased to Rs257.08 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs265.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2026-01-01 02:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964388/president-pm-urge-unity' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM urge unity</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday called upon the people and political forces to recommit themselves to safeguarding the country amid global, domestic challenges and hailed the nation’s resilience and paid tribute to the country’s martyrs.

The Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA) approved the merger of Telenor Pak­i­stan with PTCL earlier in December.
The regulator, however, imposed strict conditions to prevent abuse of market power and to bind the new entity to invest in upcoming spectrum auctions.
“Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers will operate as 100% owned subsidiaries of PTCL, alongside Pak Telecom Mobile Limited (PTML) commonly known as Ufone 4G, and U Microfinance Bank.”
However, Telenor Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate entity during the transition period, said the statement, adding that PTML and Telenor will then be merged as a single entity in “due course of time”, subject to regulatory approvals.
Acknowledging the contribution of Telenor to Pakistan’s telecom landscape, PTCL said the telco “played a defining role in elevating service quality and expanding connectivity over nearly two decades”.
“This milestone brings together complementary strengths to create a platform with a stronger focus on customer centricity, broader reach, and accelerated innovation,” added the press release.
“This is a proud moment for PTCL and a significant milestone for Pakistan’s telecom sector. Our focus remains on delivering a customer-centric, seamless, and high-quality services for improvement in user experience as we bring combined strengths at scale upon completion of regulatory approvals,“ said the press release, quoting President & Chief Executive Officer PTCL and Ufone Hatem Bamatraf.
“Together, we will build a stronger, future-ready organisation that serves customers better, empowers its people, and advances Pakistan’s digital future,” he added.
In October, the policy board of PTCL accepted the terms and conditions set by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) for the merger with Telenor Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-31 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31211126d3c94d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964299/world-begins-to-bid-goodbye-to-2025-with-fireworks-and-icy-plunges' target='_blank'><strong>World begins to bid goodbye to 2025 with fireworks and icy plunges</strong></a><br><p>As Wednesday turned to Thursday, people around the world said goodbye to a sometimes challenging 2025 and expressed hopes for the new year to come.
Midnight arrived first on the islands closest to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean, including Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tonga and New Zealand.
In Australia, Sydney began 2026 with a spectacular fireworks display, as per tradition. Some 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretched 7 kilometres across buildings and barges along its harbour and featured a waterfall effect from the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
This year, it was held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Organisers held a minute’s silence for the victims of the attack at 11pm local time (5pm PKT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah — a symbol of Judaism — projected onto its pylons.
“After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026,” Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.
In Croatia, revels got off to an early start. Since 2000, the town of Fuzine has held its countdown at noon, a tradition that has since spread across the country. Crowds cheered, toasted each other with champagne and danced to music - all in the middle of the day. Some brave souls in Santa hats took a plunge into the icy waters of Lake Bajer.

Elsewhere, preparations got underway for the more traditional midnight toast. In subzero temperatures in New York, organisers began putting up security barriers and stages ahead of the crowds that will flock to Times Square for the annual ball drop.
In Seoul, thousands gathered at the Bosingak bell pavilion, where a bronze bell is struck 33 times at midnight — a tradition rooted in Buddhist cosmology, symbolising the 33 heavens. The chimes are believed to dispel misfortune and welcome peace and prosperity for the year ahead.

The change in command comes after incumbent IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon relinquished charge today after attaining the age of superannuation.







According to a notification issued by Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah, “Mr. Allah Bux alias Javed Akhtar Odho, an officer of Police Service of Pakistan (BS-21), Additional Inspector General of Police, Karachi Range, is assigned the additional charge of the post of Inspector General of Police, Sindh, in addition to his own duties, until further orders.”

Karachi police chief Odho, who took charge as additional inspector general of Karachi last year, has assumed the additional charge of IGP Sindh on the same day that his predecessor relinquished his position, said a police spokesperson.
Meanwhile, in his farewell message, the outgoing IGP said that he had prioritised ‘technology-driven policing’ and ‘systemic investigation reforms’ as key components of the policing strategy.
Memon, a BS-21 officer, took charge as IGP Sindh in March, 2024. He was serving as State Life Insurance Corporation executive director before his posting.
He also served in the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as a director in Karachi from 2006 to 2008, and later as joint director of IB Sindh twice between 2011 and 2016.
The government awarded him the Sitara-i-Shujahat and Tamgha-i-Imtiaz for his professional achievements.</p><small>2025-12-31 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311945346d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964294/pakistan-expresses-complete-solidarity-with-saudi-arabia-reiterates-support-for-territorial-integrity-of-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses ‘complete solidarity’ with Saudi Arabia, reiterates support for ‘territorial integrity’ of Yemen</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday expressed “complete solidarity” with Saudi Arabia amid a resurgence of violence in Yemen, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).

Islamabad also reiterated its support for the “unity and territorial integrity” of Yemen, along with all efforts to establish “lasting peace and stability” in the country.







“In this regard, Pakistan strongly opposes unilateral steps by any Yemeni party that may further escalate the situation, undermine peace efforts, and threaten the peace and stability of Yemen as well as that of the region,” the statement read, adding that Islamabad welcomes regional efforts for de-escalating the situation.

The CDF made these remarks during the 18th National Workshop on Balochistan at General Headquarters (GHQ), where he highlighted the continued efforts of Indian sponsored proxies to “propagate violence and disrupt development”, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement added that the field marshal reaffirmed that these groups’ plans would be thwarted through “stern actions” by the security forces to rid the province of terrorism and unrest.
“Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, the COAS & CDF also emphasised that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity, whether direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response,” the statement read. “[The] Pakistan Armed Forces remain committed to protect the lives and well-being of its citizens.”
The ISPR said that today’s workshop focused on exploring Balochistan’s socio-economic development and its strategic importance for Pakistan.
In an address, Field Marshal Munir appreciated the resilience of the people of Balochistan and highlighted their pivotal importance for Pakistan’s prosperity and development.
“He lauded the wide-ranging initiatives being undertaken by the federal and provincial governments, underscoring a people-centric approach that aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of the province and unlock its vast economic potential for the benefit of its people,” the statement added.
According to the ISPR, the CDF also hailed the role of civil society in his address, highlighting their role in countering disinformation and propaganda, as well as their driving sustainable development.
“He stressed the importance of rejecting vested political agendas to ensure that Balochistan’s future is shaped by long-term prosperity for all its residents,” the statement read.
In May and October this year, Pakistan saw violations of its sovereignty by neighbours India and Afghanistan, respectively.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, in October, Pakistan – Afghanistan relations deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with Islamabad pressing Kabul to curb cross-border terrorism.
After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire followed talks in Doha and later in Istanbul, but successive rounds of negotiations failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar.
Pakistan has also witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.</p><small>2025-12-31 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311849495a411df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291/na-speaker-sadiq-indian-fm-jaishankar-shake-hands-in-dhaka-in-first-high-level-contact-since-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>NA Speaker Sadiq, Indian FM Jaishankar shake hands in Dhaka in first high-level contact since May conflict</strong></a><br><p>Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year.
Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.
A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.
“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.
“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [sic].”







The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.
Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.
Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.
Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.
However, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.</p><small>2025-12-31 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31150256cffbac2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964287/dar-to-visit-beijing-for-strategic-dialogue-scheduled-for-jan-4' target='_blank'><strong>Dar to visit Beijing for strategic dialogue scheduled for Jan 4</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will visit Beijing to co-chair the seventh round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue, which is scheduled to be held on January 4, 2026, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday.
According to the FO, Dar will be visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
It said that the dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism between Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.







It added that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
“The visit forms an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflects their shared determination to broaden and deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development,” the FO statement said.
While the FO did not give the exact dates for Dar’s visit, the Chinese foreign ministry said he would be visiting from January 3 to 6, 2026.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in August, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2025-12-31 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3113540664070b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964281/rules-amended-to-legally-recognise-facial-iris-scans-as-biometric-identities' target='_blank'><strong>Rules amended to legally recognise facial, iris scans as biometric identities</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has amended the National Identity Card (NIC) Rules, widening the definition of biometrics to legally recognise facial and iris scans as valid biometric identifiers, besides fingerprints, the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) said on Wednesday.
The amendment, made on the authority’s recommendation, provides a robust legal foundation for the implementation of a multi-biometric verification system in Pakistan.
Based on this legal framework, Nadra has introduced technical innovations enabling contactless fingerprint and facial recognition-based biometric verification.
In a statement, Nadra said this system is currently available both at the authority‘s registration centres and on the Pak ID mobile application for services falling within the authority’s jurisdiction. It is already being utilised for biometric verification in transferring Islamabad-registered vehicles and online passport applications.
In the near future, proof-of-life certificates for federal government pensioners will also be issued under this system, while the scope of these digital services is being expanded in phases.
Effective from Jan 20, 2026, Nadra will start issuing facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates at all its registration centres for those citizens for whom fingerprint-based verification is not possible. Wherever any institution requires such verification, citizens may obtain this certificate from any Nadra registration centre after paying a nominal fee of Rs20.
Under this procedure, if fingerprint-based biometric verification fails at the service provider’s end, the citizen will visit the nearest Nadra registration centre to have a fresh photograph taken.
This photograph will be matched with the image already available in Nadra’s records. Upon successful verification, Nadra will issue a certificate containing the purpose of verification, the citizen’s recent photograph alongside the photograph on record, their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number, name, father’s name, a unique tracking ID and a QR code.
The certificate will be valid for seven days. The citizen will submit it to the relevant institution where biometric verification is required and the concerned institution will incorporate the certificate into its records and verify it online through Nadra.
In the future, facial image-based biometric verification certificates will also be available through Nadra’s e-Sahulat franchises. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, this facility will be made available for all services through the Pak-ID application.
In a statement, Nadra said it was fully prepared to implement this system. However, for its effective execution, it requested all regulators, relevant public institutions and private sector organisations to progressively upgrade their hardware and software in accordance with approved standards to enable the use of this biometric verification service.
In the first phase, technical upgrades to institutional software applications will be required to allow the integration of facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates issued by Nadra. In the second phase, it will be necessary for institutions to install cameras at service counters or integrate cameras into existing know your customer (KYC) biometric machines, as without these upgrades, the authority cannot provide this facility directly at such locations.
If citizens encounter any issues regarding the availability of this service after Jan 20, 2026, they may lodge complaints with the relevant institution or department, as the service will be available from Nadra’s end.
To ensure the earliest possible operationalisation of this facility, Nadra has also requested the interior ministry to issue appropriate instructions to all institutions concerned. It is envisaged that, following the rollout of this system, the difficulties faced by citizens due to faded fingerprints will be effectively resolved.
Upon full implementation, citizens will be able to avail this facility directly at the relevant institution without the need to visit a Nadra Registration Centre. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, citizens will also be able to access this facility independently through the Pak-ID application.

 

On the occasion of the new year, Nadra reaffirmed its commitment to further enhance its services through technological innovation while strengthening safeguards against identity fraud and misuse.
Due to age or certain medical conditions, the fingerprints of many citizens gradually fade over time. When such citizens approach banks, SIM card franchises, housing societies or seek services related to property transfer and other transactions where biometric verification through fingerprints is mandatory, they often face significant difficulties.
Moreover, at many service points, biometric verification is also not possible due to the use of substandard or low-quality fingerprint readers. Although the State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority have prescribed mechanisms to facilitate such citizens, in practice individuals continue to face considerable challenges in availing these services.
To ensure an immediate and effective resolution of this issue, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had issued directives to Nadra and key measures have been taken in compliance.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:56</small></div><hr>
