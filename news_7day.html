Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail-led subcommittee met on Friday with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq H. Naek from the treasury benches and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar from the opposition in attendance.
The JCP subcommittee decided to consolidate and circulate each suggestion among all members for discussion at the next meeting, scheduled for the coming week and postponed proceedings, with an understanding to thoroughly discuss draft suggestions on framing benchmarks to assess judicial performance of sitting judges of the high courts.
One of the proposals was to consider the time period within which a judgement is delivered after it has been reserved by a high court judge, since inordinate delays ultimately frustrate litigants.

Members put forward suggestions, to be consolidated for discussion next week

The committee also suggested making it obligatory for high court judges to pronounce judgements within three months, as held in 2015 Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd case by a three-judge Supreme Court bench.
Presided over by Justice Saqib Nisar, the apex court in its ruling had held that a reasonable time for the pronouncement of judgements should be 90 days, since the enunciation of law requires considerable research, reflection and deliberation.
Ninety days, it noted, should be adequate for composition of judgements. If judges are unable to deliver judgements within this time period, they must record sufficient reasons and may order the case to be reheard.
Number of cases
Another proposal under consideration was for the JCP to evaluate how many cases a judge decides in a month, and whether those decisions involve substantive matters that advance jurisprudence or merely routine bail matters.
The proposals also included assessing whether a judge exhausts the entire cause list for the day or merely hears a few cases and adjourns the rest.
However, questions remain about how benchmarks will account for cases withdrawn after judges point out jurisdictional flaws. A legal expert, noted that such withdrawals save judicial time by avoiding unnecessary appeals, yet they are never reported in law digests. “Should a judge be penalised for thoroughly understanding the case and prompting withdrawal?” the expert asked.
The expert further explained that performance cannot simply be measured by the number of cases heard in a day, as much depends on the type of cases assigned by the chief justice. For example, civil revision cases are time-consuming and complex, whereas other categories may involve issuing directions to departments and can be decided more quickly. Comparing judges across such different case types would be unfair, he argued.
 
 

On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee on judicial performance evaluation of high court judges. The committee, comprising members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and legal fraternity, was tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations and developing criteria for the selection of judges.
The 26th Amendment to Article 175A allows the JCP to give underperforming high court judges time to improve, and if they fail, recommend their removal to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
And after the completion of the period so granted, the performance of the judge is again found to be inefficient; the commission will send its report to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) with a recommendation to remove the judge.
Moreover, the commission will hold annual evaluations of high court judges and may set rules to define performance standards.

He also denounced several Western countries for embracing Palestinian statehood, accusing them of pushing his country into “national suicide”.
The Israeli leader, who has an International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes, addressed mostly empty chairs in the UN General Assembly, as scores of delegates — including the Pakistan contingent — walked out when he took the stage.
At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic near Times Square in New York to protest the killing of more than 65,000 people in Gaza by Israeli strikes in less than two years.

“War criminals don’t deserve any peace of mind. They don’t deserve any sleep,” said Andrea Mirez, a young woman who kept up an overnight noisy protest outside Netanyahu’s hotel.
In his speech, days after France, Britain and other Western powers amid worldwide protests against the ongoing war on Gaza recognised the state of Palestine, he showed a map of the Middle East, taking out a pen to cross out adversaries Israel has killed. He also vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, even as President Donald Trump said he thought he had sealed a deal on a ceasefire.
 
 

A senior White House official told Reuters that Trump will meet Netanyahu on Monday in Washington with the aim of reaching a framework for a deal.
In his speech, Netanyahu claimed that over time, many world leaders buckled. “They buckled under the pressure of a biased media, radical Islamist constituencies and antisemitic mobs… Behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals,” he claimed.
However, he did not touch on the issue of annexing the occupied West Bank.

Response to speech
Gaza authorities described Netanyahu’s speech as one “filled with lies and blatant contradictions” and condemned it as a “desperate attempt to justify the war crimes and acts of genocide.”
“Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement.
Also, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, earlier speaking by video after the US denied him a visa, condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza as “a war of genocide”. He thanked the countries that recognised Palestinian statehood, pledged that Palestinian Authority would be ready to govern post-war Gaza.
New coalition to back Palestine
On the other hand, 12 countries — Britain, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland — announced a new coalition to financially support the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority as Israel withheld tax revenues of Palestinian Authority for past two years.
The Emergency Coalition for the Financial Sustainability of the Palestinian Authority “was established in response to the urgent and unprecedented financial crisis” confronting the PA, the Spanish foreign ministry said.
It aims to stabilise the Ramallah-based body’s finances, preserve its ability to govern, provide essential services and maintain security, “all of which are indispensable to regional stability and to preserving the two-state solution”, the statement added.

Justice Raheel Kamran, delivering a detailed 20-page judgement, observed that the ordinance was enacted in a pre-digital era to regulate films exhibited through cinematographs in cinemas and other public venues, and was not designed for online streaming services.
The petitioners, including NC Entertainment (Pvt) Ltd, had argued that requiring cinemas to obtain film certification while leaving digital platforms unregulated was discriminatory and infringed their fundamental rights.
They contended that censorship principles under Section 6 of the Ordinance, derived from Article 19 of the Constitution, should apply equally across all platforms to uphold social norms of decency and morality.

Says extending Motion Pictures Ordinance to streaming services will be ‘judicial legislation’

The counsel argued that provisions of the ordinance had not been enforced equally against all mediums and platforms of public and private exhibition and the same were being applied selectively and arbitrarily against the petitioners, leaving all other digital platforms to continue unchecked.
A law officer for the federal government opposed the writ petitions as not maintainable.
He said the petitioners were not aggrieved and none of their established rights had been restricted or hindered by any of the respondents.
He maintained that following the 18th constitutional amendment, the subject of cinematograph censorship devolved upon the provinces, granting them exclusive authority in this regard.
He contended that the term “cinematograph” shall be construed keeping in view the context of the ordinance and OTT platforms were not covered by it.
A law officer for the Punjab government stated that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) exclusively deals with electronic media and that the jurisdiction of the Punjab Film Censor Board was only restricted to the censorship of films.
He also emphasised that the term “cinematograph” was to be construed in the context of the ordinance, which had no application to the OTT platforms.
A lawyer for Pemra argued that the body was a regulatory authority for the broadcasting media and distribution of services and it was responsible only for improving the quality standards of the channels shown to the people of Pakistan.
He contended that Pemra had no nexus with the motion picture law and the petitioners. He also questioned the locus standi of the petitioners.
A counsel for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) also stated that it had no mandate or jurisdiction to regulate matters pertaining to content that was available for viewership on OTT platforms.
Advocate Zeeshan Zafar Hashmi, an amicus curiae (an impartial adviser to a court of law), also stated that the ordinance essentially deals with the exhibition of films by means of cinematograph, which is controlled by the Censor Board through censorship.
Justice Kamran observed that OTT platforms, which operate globally and deliver content directly to users on personal devices, fall outside the framework of the ordinance.
The judge noted that pre-censorship of OTT platforms was not only legally untenable but also logistically impossible given the vast, continuously updated nature of digital content.
 
 

Justice Kamran ruled that extending the motion pictures ordinance to cover OTT platforms would amount to judicial legislation, which is beyond the court’s domain.
The judge observed that cinemas and OTT platforms are fundamentally distinct and therefore not “similarly circumstanced” entities under Article 25 of the Constitution.
The judge also dismissed the petitioners’ contention that importing digital content is exempt from the Import Policy Order 2022, holding that once content is exhibited publicly in Pakistan, it must comply with domestic laws governing public exhibition.
Justice Kamran then dismissed the petitions, declaring that they were not maintainable on legal or practical grounds.

The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil.
The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan.
They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.”
The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”.
The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan.
 
 

The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions.
They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution.
They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

• FBR analysis points to widespread reluctance in voluntary asset valuation
ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic U-turn, the government on Friday scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
The lightning-fast reversal, prompted by criticism from tax practitioners, lawyers and other groups, has reignited debate over policy consistency and digital reforms aimed at documenting the cash economy.
The income tax return form for 2025, released on July 7, had required taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form. Since then, taxpayers had been submitting returns with the flexibility to either declare the estimated market value of their assets or enter zero in the designated column.
This practice continued even as nearly 2.7 million taxpayers filed their returns under the same arrangement. However, internal analysis by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) revealed a widespread reluctance to voluntarily declare market values.
In response, the FBR introduced a technical adjustment to the system, eliminating the option to enter zero and effectively making it mandatory for all filers to disclose a fair estimate of their asset values. This move triggered strong resistance from multiple quarters, highlighting persistent reluctance to support the formal documentation of the country’s largely cash-driven economy.
On Thursday, the FBR issued a strongly worded clarification, urging taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets in good faith. It assured filers that such disclosures would not be used as grounds for additional taxation and that no supplementary documentation would be required for verification, nor would tax notices be issued solely on the basis of declared asset values.
Despite these assurances, the controversy persisted. In response, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
 
 

The committee was tas­ked with evaluating the implications of the provision for taxpayers and recommending corrective measures to ensure clarity, fairness and administrative feasibility.
On Friday, the committee held consultations with top tax officers to assess the legal aspect of the column.
“The requirement to declare the true market value of assets is firmly embedded in the income tax law,” a senior tax official said, adding that many taxpayers were reluctant to disclose the actual value of their assets, reflecting broader resistance to financial transparency.
Following deliberations, the committee decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister, an FBR announcement said.
The committee included the federal minister for petroleum, the minister of state for finance, the attorney general for Pakistan, the special assistant to the prime minister on coordination, the finance secretary, the FBR chairman and its member customs.
After detailed discussions in its meeting on Friday, the committee recommended that the new column requiring taxpayers to declare estimated fair market values of their assets be withdrawn in the interest of simplifying the filing process.
The recommendation was submitted to the prime minister, who approved it.
According to the statement, in line with the premier’s directives and considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, the “Estimated Fair Market Value” column has been removed from the income tax return form.
It clarified that the column had been introduced solely for data collection to support the Economic Survey and had no bearing on the assessment of income or tax liability.
The FBR reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating taxpayers and urged all eligible individuals to file their returns accurately and in good faith before the Sept 30, 2025, deadline.

• 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says
• Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced
ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains, the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m.
More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala.
 
 

The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts.
Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes.
According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes.
Health facilities
A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara.
In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed.
By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability.
 
 

The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases.
Educational institutions
According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools.
Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15).
Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur.
 
 

Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal.
Livestock
Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity.
Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days.
Ex-gratia assistance
Meanwhiel, the Senate standing committee on cabinet secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion.
The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded.
The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued.
The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

“Wi-Fi 7 delivers ultra-high data rates, low latency, and robust reliability, enabling 8K streaming, AR/VR, and industrial automation,” the press release read.
“By easing congestion in legacy bands and reducing broadband delivery costs, it will strengthen connectivity for households, SMEs (small-medium enterprises), campuses, healthcare, and smart cities.”
This development comes a week after Information and Technology Secretary Zarrar Hasham said that restoring damaged undersea internet cables may take four to five weeks.

In a related development, the University of Karachi (KU) issued a fresh declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of the IHC judge’s degree.
On Thursday, heated scenes were witnessed at the SHC as a two-judge bench declined to entertain the plea of the IHC judge to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it.
In its written order on Friday, the CB noted that it had “given an opportunity of hearing to all the lawyers for the petitioners on the question of maintainability” of these pleas, but they “deliberately chose not to avail this opportunity and instead walked out of [the] courtroom while causing a rumpus”.
It added that it was for the court to regulate its own proceedings and it could not be held hostage to the “whims or wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”.
The order read that Justice Jahangiri, with the permission of the bench, addressed the court with dignity and patience, but “not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, were accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left [the] courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard”.
On the objections raised by the counsel for the petitioners, the CB noted that if they had any reservations about the transfer of these pleas from one bench to another, the appropriate course was to approach the apex court, which they failed to do.
The order further read that it was up to a judge to decide if they wanted to recuse themselves from a case or not based on their conscience.
The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the University of Karachi (KU) syndicate, challenging the decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
However, the dismissal of these petitions over non-prosecution has led to the withdrawal of the earlier interim stay and restraining order.
The SHC, in its order, observed that the superior courts possessed the “inherent power to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default regulate proceedings under Articles 199 of the Constitution, a principle confirmed by the Supreme Court in PLD 1993 SC 341 and 2006 SCMR 1154, where a persistent lack of diligence justifies dismissal”.
“Therefore, this court is compelled to dismiss the petitions due to non-prosecution,” it added.
It noted that when the counsel representing the parties, along with other members of the bar, insisted that their objections be decided first, the court informed them that all matters would be heard and decided together.
The bench further noted that they began shouting slogans against the judiciary. completely disrupting the decorum of the court.
“Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession,” it added.
“Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court. However, by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices. It is expected that the concerned counsel should maintain court decorum in future.”
The CB directed the SHC registrar to immediately preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of September 25, both inside and outside of the courtroom.
KU declaration
After the dismissal of the petitions, the KU issued a new declaration about the withdrawal and cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In August last year, the KU syndicate had cancelled the judge’s law degree on the recommendation of its UMC.
The decision came a few hours after the alleged detention of academic and syndicate member Dr Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by the police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate had decided to cancel the degree.

While trade negotiations are on a positive track, a US official said, more work is needed to ensure India addresses US concerns over market access, the trade deficit and purchases of Russian oil.
US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure India, the European Union and members of Nato to curb purchases of Russian oil as a way to cut Moscow’s revenue and hasten an end to the war in Ukraine.
The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use maximum leverage to advance its policy goals, as evidenced by its linking trade negotiations with India to demands that it curb Russian oil purchases.
Trump has expressed growing frustration over the slow progress toward ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, a conflict he pledged to resolve from his first day in office.
The US has already imposed an extra 25 per cent tariff on imports from India to pressure New Delhi to halt its purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, bringing total punitive duties on Indian goods to 50pc and souring trade negotiations between the two democracies.
But Trump has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports over China’s purchases of Russian oil, as his administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.
India and China are the two largest buyers of Russian oil, which is already subject to numerous US sanctions that have constrained Moscow’s access to global markets.
In response, India has defended its oil imports, emphasising the economic benefits and accusing Western nations of hypocrisy for continuing trade with Russia despite sanctions.</p><small>2025-09-26 18:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26202053eee0b3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944785/at-unga-pm-shehbaz-says-south-asia-requires-proactive-not-provocative-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>At UNGA, PM Shehbaz says South Asia requires ‘proactive not provocative’ leadership</strong></a><br><p>As Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif detailed the events of May’s four-day escalation between India and Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday, he highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia.
In May, the military confrontation between India and Pakistan had come as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
PM Shehbaz recalled the escalation at the 80th session of the UNGA today, where he led Pakistan’s delegation.
He began his address with these words: “Our world is more complex today than ever before. Conflicts are intensifying, international law is being brazenly violated, humanitarian crises are multiplying, terrorism remains a potent threat, disinformation and fake news undermine trust, climate change threatens our very survival, and more so for countries like Pakistan.”
He added that today, multilateralism was no more an option but the need of the hour.
PM Shehbaz then explained that Pakistan’s foreign policy was based on peace, mutual respect and cooperation.
“We believe in the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy,” he asserted.
The premier recalled that last year, from this very podium, “I had warned that Pakistan would act most decisively against any external aggression”.
 
  @dawn.today Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, delivering his keynote address at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, recalled that from the same podium last year he had warned Pakistan would respond decisively to any external aggression. “Those words proved true. In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation,” he said.

“Those words of mine proved true … In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. Our enemy came shrouded in arrogance, [and] we sent them back in humiliation.
“India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and our national security were violated, our response was in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
He hailed Pakistan’s armed forces and the military leadership, saying: “Our valiant armed forces, under the stellar leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir mounted an operation of stunning professionalism, bravey and acumen. Repelling the enemy’s attack under Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, our falcons took flight and etched their answer across the skies, resulting in seven of the Indian jets being turned to scrap and dust.”
As the premier commended the Pakistani forces and people for their resolve during the escalation with India, slogans of “Pakistan Zindabad” (long live Pakistan) and “Shehbaz Sharif Zindabad” (long live Shehbaz Sharif) were heard in the UNGA hall.
The prime minister Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire following a four-day escalation with India in May from a position of strength. He also expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump and his tams for “their active role” in bringing about the ceasefire.
“President Trump’s efforts for peace helped avert a … war in South Asia. Had he not intervened timely and decisively, the consequences of a full-fledged war would have been catastrophic,” PM Shehbaz said. “Therefore, in recognition of President Trump’s wonderful and outstanding contribution to promote peace in our part of the world, Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is the least we could do … I think he truly is a man of peace.”
He also thanked Pakistan’s “friends and partners”, including China, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the UN secretary general for extending diplomatic support to Pakistan during the escalation in May.
“We have won the war, and now we seek to win peace in our part of the world. This is my most sincere serious offer before this august assembly of the world nations. Pakistan stands ready for a composite, comprehensive and result-oriented dialogue with India on all outstanding issues,” he said.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that South Asia required “proactive rather than provocative leadership”.
The “unilateral and illegal attempt to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance defies the provisions of the treaty itself, as well as the norms of international law itself,” he said, adding that Pakistan had made it abundantly clear that “we will definitely and ardently defend the … right of our 240m people on these waters”.
He expressed solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir, saying that one day, India’s tyranny in the valley would come to a grinding halt.
“Kashmir will gain its fundamental right to self-determination through an impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations,” he said.
‘Heart wrenching’
Turning his attention toward Gaza, he said the plight of the Palestinian people was one of the “most heart-wrenching tragedies of our time”.
“This prolonged injustice is a stain on the global conscious and our collective moral failure. For nearly 80 years, the Palestinians have courageously endured Israel’s brutal occupation of their homeland. In the West Bank, each passing day brings new brutality,” he grieved.
In Gaza, he said, Israel’s genocidal onslaught had unleashed unspeakable terror upon women and children in a manner that had not been witnessed in the annals of history.
“In [the] blind pursuit of its nefarious goals, the Israeli leadership has unleashed a shameful campaign against the innocent Palestinians, which history will remember as one of its darkest chapters,” he added.
Emphasising the need to raise voice over the atrocities in Gaza, he said, “We must speak, and speak loud and clear.”
He added, “Our words are too little and too late for Hind Rajab. A child, nay a little baby … My agony and the agony of the entire Muslim ummah, and the agony of all the nations on this planet, is that we failed Hind Rajab. And she will not forgive us.”

The PM continued, “The smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry. I would know, as I carried the coffin of Irtaza Abbas during the recent confrontation with India. He was only six years old. Therefore, we cannot and must not fail these children of Gaza, or any child anywhere in the world. We must find a path to a ceasefire now.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a sovereign Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders and Jerusalem as its capital.
“Palestine can no no longer remain under Israeli shackles, it must be liberated and liberated with full commitment and full force.”
He also welcomed the recognition of the State of Palestine by several countries recently and urged others to follow suit.
Referring to a meeting of Trump with the leaders of some Muslim countries earlier this week, he appreciated the US president’s “timely initiative” to call the moot on Gaza.
“I was also a part of that consultative process and I … pray to God that it rekindles hope for a ceasefire in the nearest future,” PM Shehbaz said.
He went on to criticise Israel for its recent attack on Doha that targetted Hamas leaders. Condemning the strike, he expressed solidarity with Qatar.
The premier also expressed support for efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict in line with the UN Charter,  “to end human suffering and global turmoil cause by this protracted war”.
‘Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism’
Speaking about terrorism, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations.
For two decades, Pakistan had been on the frontline of global counter-terrorism efforts, he highlighted, asking, “What can be a bigger  manifestation of our commitment to fight terrorism and erase it, not only from the face of Pakistan but from the face of this global world?”
He asserted that unless terrorism was defeated hands down, this world would not be a peaceful place to live. “For that, Pakistan’s sacrifices are probably the biggest around the globe. It must be respected and appreciated, because we’re a bulwark,” he continued. “Had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming the streets of New York, London and God knows, the Far East.”
The premier said Pakistan was today facing the problem of externally sponsored terrorism, particularly from foreign funded groups that were operating from the Afghan soil.
He stressed that Pakistan “has a direct stake in a peaceful Afghanistan”.
“We believe that the key to development and prosperity lies in regional stability and connectivity. Pakistan continues to engage with all partners to extend humanitarian assistance, promote economic recovery and encourage an inclusive political framework in Afghanistan,” he said.
But, he went on to say, “the interim Afghan government must uphold human rights, including women’s rights. Above all, we expect the interim government to take effective action against terrorist groups and to ensure that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against any country”.
Dangers of Islamophobia
The prime minister further underlined that “there must be no space for hate speech, discrimination or violence against any person, or against any religion”.
“Hate-driven ideologies, like Hindutva-driven extremism in India, pose a danger to the entire world. While there is growing recognition of the dangers posed by Islamophobia, the imperative of effectively combatting this menace can hardly be over emphasised,” he asserted.
The premier said Pakistan welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy to combat this scourge.
‘Urgent collective action’
On the climate crisis, he said Pakistan demands “urgent collective action”.
Speaking of the recent floods in the country, he said: “Our nation stands united in these testing times. We are dealing with this natural calamity with remarkable resilience … I have declared a climate emergency to cope with this challenge.”
He termed the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025  in Pakistan “glaring examples of loss and damage caused due to climate change”.
The premier also pointed out that Pakistan’s contribution to emissions annually was less than one per cent. “Yet, it continues to face the relentless brunt and muddy waves of climate change, and then we are told to take loans and add to our debt,” he rued.
“This is not fairness, this is not equality, this is not justice, this is not fair play,” he asserted. “I think borrowing loans would be [akin to] destroying our economy. We would be better off … standing on our own feet, working hard and tirelessly.”
He concluded his speech, saying: “At the end, let me assure you [that] Pakistan will always stand for peace, justice and development for a revitalised UN and cooperative multilateralism that is fair, inclusive and delivers for all.
“Let this 80th anniversary [of the UN] not simply commemorate history. Let’s make history and chart a future for the next 80 years with these united nations as an enduring hope for global good. Let us truly strive to become better together.”</p><small>2025-09-26 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26204846e2653cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944798/tehran-moscow-sign-25bn-deal-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-iran-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Tehran, Moscow sign $25bn deal to build nuclear plants in Iran: state media</strong></a><br><p>Iran and Russia signed a $25 billion deal to build nuclear power plants in the Islamic republic, Iranian state media reported on Friday, just hours ahead of the likely return of sweeping UN sanctions on Iran.
“A deal for the construction of four nuclear power plants with a value of $25 billion in Sirik, Hormozgan was signed between the Iran Hormoz company and Rosatom,” state television said.
Iran has just one operational nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south, with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts — just a fraction of the country’s energy needs.
According to state news agency IRNA, each plant will have a capacity of 1,255 megawatts, though no details were provided on the timeline.
The move comes as so-called snapback sanctions triggered by the European parties to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran are set to return by the end of Saturday.
Britain, France and Germany triggered the sanctions last month, accusing of Iran of failing to adhere to its commitments under the agreement.
At a Security Council session on Friday, China and Russia put forward a draft resolution to allow another half year for talks, but it is unlikely to garner enough support to pass.
Western countries have long accused Iran of seeking an atomic bomb — a charge Tehran vehemently denies, defending its right to a civilian nuclear programme.
The United States in 2018 unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear accord with Iran, prompting Tehran to begin walking back its commitments.
Talks between Washington and Tehran to strike a new deal were underway, before being derailed by unprecedented Israeli strikes on Iran in June that began a 12-day war briefly joined by the United States.
Iran had previously signed with Russia a nuclear energy deal in 1993 allowing for the construction of the Bushehr plant, after Germany had abandoned it in the wake of the Islamic revolution of 1979.</p><small>2025-09-26 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2620210163fc999.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944786/asia-cup-haris-fined-farhan-given-warning-for-gestures-during-super-four-match-against-india-report-says' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Haris fined, Farhan given warning for gestures during Super Four match against India, report says</strong></a><br><p>Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were on Friday reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported.
According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson.
“Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.”
Earlier, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military skirmish between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported.
“It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
“The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added.
Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
With that win, the Green Shirts bookëd their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-26 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2614382259a8aa8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944756/remarkable-turnaround-but-caution-warranted-analysts-weigh-in-on-pm-shehbazs-meeting-with-trump' target='_blank'><strong>‘Remarkable turnaround but caution warranted’: Analysts weigh in on PM Shehbaz’s meeting with Trump</strong></a><br><p>Big smiles, a red carpet and a thumbs up: the first formal bilateral interaction between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US President Donald Trump during the early hours of Friday morning was plastered all over the airwaves.
The meeting, which was also attended by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, was described by the Prime Minister’s Office as being held in a pleasant atmosphere.
However, the meeting itself was closed to the press — a break from President Trump’s usual modus operendi — as he is quite fond of Oval Office photo-ops and there was no press conference either; just a statement issued from Pakistan where the US president was described as a “man of peace” and stressing the need to enhance cooperation in security and intelligence.
With Pak-US ties ‘gradually warming’ in President Trump’s second term, the meeting was closely watched by geopolitical hawks and analysts. Here’s what some had to say about it:
‘Quite surprising’
Author and journalist Zahid Hussain termed the meeting “very significant” for Pakistan, adding that the positive ties came as a “surprise” in the wake of the deterioration in relations with the US over the previous four years.
“It was quite surprising, because the president was supposed to be very close to India,” he said.
According to Hussain, the positive shift began in March, when the president praised Pakistan’s cooperation in arresting the person responsible for killing 13 US service members.
He stated that ties were further bolstered with Washington’s intervention during the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May.
Hussain highlighted that Field Marshal Munir’s meeting with Trump in July was “unprecedented” and that the president “bypassed all the protocols”.
“In the past, we have seen Pakistan army chiefs have been meeting American presidents, but in a different capacity … when they were also president of the country,” he said.
“Certainly there has been some improvement in relations, but what happened yesterday — we don’t know much about it,” he said, adding that no statement or press briefing following the meeting had been issued as yet.
He did, however, point out that the meeting ran long, lasting an hour and 20 minutes instead of the expected 45 minutes.
“The most significant part of it was that along with the prime minister, the army chief was also present there,” he said. “So that signifies that relations with Pakistan are largely dependent on security and intelligence cooperation.”
Highlighting the importance of the military aspect in previous times when the US had been an ally, he said, “I think this is a recognition that the real power lies with the military in Pakistan.”
Highlighting the historically “transactional” relationship between the two countries, particularly with Trump, Hussain added, “What has been the American demand? We don’t know …  certainly there’s something more to it.”
‘Remarkable turnaround but caution warranted’
Diplomat Maleeha Lodhi, who has previously served as Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former ambassador to the US, termed the continuing warming of relations between the US and Pakistan a “remarkable turnaround” after ties had plunged to a low during the term of previous US president Joe Biden in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“The meeting has injected greater momentum to the reset of Pakistan-US ties,” she told Dawn.com, adding that the invitation of a Pakistani premier to the White House after six years reflected “renewed US recognition of Pakistan’s geopolitical importance in the region and the Middle East at a time of changing international dynamics”.
“But an assessment of the significance of the White House meeting has to wait for details of what was discussed and which areas the two countries have agreed to cooperate in,” Lodhi added.
“Caution is warranted by the roller coaster nature of relations in the past, which saw several highs and many lows,” she said.
‘Will wait to form opinion’
Senior Dawn correspondent Baqir Sajjad Syed held off on commenting on the meeting between the two leaders.
“There is very little information out there,” he said.
“I will wait to hear from the White House or US State Department before forming any opinion,” he added.
‘Wasn’t a state visit’
Michael Kugelman, an expert on Washington’s relations with South Asian nations, challenged the notion that a “huge protocol” was accorded to Shehbaz and Munir in Washington, DC.
“Don’t agree,” he simply said in a post on X, pointing out that the PM was received by a US military officer and that the delegation received the expected standard motorcade for the drive.
“Protocol was basic. This wasn’t a state visit,” he said.
 






He recalled Imran Khan’s visit to the White House in 2019, during which the then-army chief General Bajwa, who accompanied him, was “in the background and barely seen”.
“Munir, by contrast, was front and centre today,” he said. “Exactly as one would expect,” he added.

The new US company will be valued at around $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance said, putting a price tag on the popular short video app far below some analyst estimates.
Trump on Thursday delayed until January 20 enforcement of the law that bans the app unless its Chinese owners sell it amid efforts to extract TikTok’s US assets from the global platform, line up American and other investors, and win approval from the Chinese government.
The publication of the executive order shows Trump is making progress on the sale of TikTok’s US assets, but numerous details need to be fleshed out, including how the US entity would use TikTok’s most important asset, its recommendation algorithm.
“There was some resistance on the Chinese side, but the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans’ data privacy as required by law,” Vance told reporters at an Oval Office briefing.
Trump’s order says the algorithm will be retrained and monitored by the US company’s security partners, and operation of the algorithm will be under the control of the new joint venture.
Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping had indicated approval of the plans. “I spoke with President Xi,” Trump said. “We had a good talk, I told him what we were doing and he said go ahead with it.”
China’s foreign ministry on Friday reiterated that the government “respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules to reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balance of interests”.
“We hope the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a press conference, without giving further details of the deal.
TikTok did not immediately comment on Trump’s action.
Trump has credited TikTok, which has 170 million US users, with helping him win reelection last year. Trump has 15 million followers on his personal TikTok account. The White House also launched an official TikTok account last month.
“This is going to be American-operated all the way,” Trump said.
He said that Michael Dell, the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies; Rupert Murdoch, the chairman emeritus of Fox News owner Fox Corp and newspaper publisher News Corp, and “probably four or five absolutely world-class investors” would be part of the deal.
The White House did not discuss how it came up with the $14 billion valuation.
TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, currently values itself at more than $330 billion, according to its new employee share buyback plan. TikTok contributes a small percentage of the company’s total revenue.
According to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, TikTok was estimated to be worth $30 billion to $40bn without the algorithm as of April 2025.
Alan Rozenshtein, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the executive order left unanswered questions, including whether ByteDance would still control the algorithm.
“The problem is that the president has certified the deal, but he has not provided a lot of information on the algorithm,” he said.
Chinese media on Friday also painted a different picture of the TikTok agreement, suggesting ByteDance would continue to play a major or operational role.
ByteDance will set up a new US company as part of the restructuring of TikTok’s US operations, Chinese media outlet LatePost reported, citing sources.
The new company to be set up by ByteDance will be responsible for e-commerce, branding operations and interconnection with international operations, the report said.
The report also said the joint venture, as described by the White House and valued at $14 billion, would be responsible for US digital security, safeguarding content and software as well as related local businesses.
Another Chinese financial magazine, Caixin, also reported, citing people close to the deal, that ByteDance planned to set up a TikTok US entity that will receive some revenue from the new TikTok joint venture.
Both reports were taken down from their respective websites later on Friday.
The White House and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oracle and others to own TikTok in the US
A group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50 per cent stake in TikTok US, two sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday.
A group of existing shareholders in ByteDance will hold a roughly 30pc stake, one of the sources said. Among ByteDance’s current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR.
Given intense investor interest in TikTok, the 50pc stake may still shift, the source noted.
Oracle and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CNBC reported earlier, citing sources, that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok US with a combined 45pc ownership.
MGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report.
Republican House of Representatives lawmakers said they wanted to see more details of the deal to ensure it represented a clean break with China.
“As the details are finalised, we must ensure this deal protects American users from the influence and surveillance of CCP-aligned groups,” said US Representatives Brett Guthrie, Gus Bilirakis and Richard Hudson.
The agreement on TikTok’s US operations includes the appointment by ByteDance of one of seven board members for the new entity, with Americans holding the other six seats, a senior White House official said on Saturday.
ByteDance would hold less than 20pc in TikTok US to comply with requirements set out in the 2024 law that ordered it shut down by January 2025 if ByteDance did not sell its US assets.</p><small>2025-09-26 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2617482188f10c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944770/indian-police-detain-activist-after-deadly-ladakh-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police detain activist after deadly Ladakh protests</strong></a><br><p>Indian police on Friday detained prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk over violent protests in the Himalayan territory of Ladakh that left at least five people dead, a lawyer said.
Demonstrations demanding greater political autonomy for the sparsely populated, high-altitude region bordering China and Pakistan turned deadly on Wednesday when security forces opened fire.
New Delhi blamed the unrest on “provocative speeches” by Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment.
Mustafa Haji, a lawyer for the Apex Body Leh — which is spearheading the protests — told AFP that Wangchuk was “picked up” by the police from his village of Uley Tokpo on Friday.
“Charges against him are not known yet,” Haji said.
An engineer by training, Wangchuk, 59, is best known for pioneering water conservation projects in the Himalayas.
He received the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2018 for his environmental work and contributions to reforming local schooling in Ladakh.
His life and work are said to have inspired a character played by Bollywood star Aamir Khan in the hugely popular movie Three Idiots.
Wangchuk, who is a vocal advocate for Ladakh’s environmental protection and tribal rights, was briefly detained by Delhi Police last year during a protest march. Indian authorities on Thursday cancelled his non-profit organisation’s foreign funding licence.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said today that it is monitoring the situation.
“The developments that unfolded in Leh, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, are extremely disturbing,” the FO told Dawn.com. They demonstrate the Indian authorities’ willingness to go to any extent to curb a protest. They are also another manifestation of India’s iron-fisted approach in that occupied territory.“
Modi’s government split Ladakh off from occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both.
New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies.
India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.

According to the World Health Organisation, the CCHF, commonly known as Congo Virus, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. There is no vaccine available for the disease.  Experts say the CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.
As per the statement, a lab report confirmed that a 28-year-old butcher from Karachi’s Landhi area had contracted the disease. He developed symptoms on September 24, was admitted to the hospital the same day, and died within hours of admission.
His symptoms included a high-grade fever, cough, shortness of breath, and bleeding from the mouth and rectum, following which a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was carried out, confirming the presence of the virus.
The patient, who was isolated immediately after the test, had a history of animal and tick exposure due to his profession, according to the report.
“The case, reported on September 26, was verified by a surveillance team, which collected details of his contact history and risk factors,” it added.
Sindh Health Department spokesperson Meeran Yousuf told Dawn.com, “The case marked the sixth CCHF-related death in the province this year.”
Earlier, fatalities were recorded on June 17 and 18 in Karachi’s Malir area, on June 30 in Thatta, and on July 17 and August 14, again in Malir.
The disease can spread via human-to-human transmission, from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons, according to the WHO.
The onset of the symptoms is sudden, with fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light.
On June 18, a 22-year-old animal handler from the North Waziristan tribal district died of CCHF at the Hayatabad Medical Complex.
The first case of the disease in Pakistan was reported in 1976 when a surgeon, along with three healthcare providers, died following an infection from a patient.</p><small>2025-09-26 11:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26151548d5fbaa0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944760/uk-to-launch-digital-id-scheme-to-curb-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>UK to launch digital ID scheme to curb illegal migration</strong></a><br><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday announced plans for a new nationwide digital ID in a bid to curb illegal migration, but the move faces strong opposition in country that has long-resisted such moves.
The new digital ID will be held on people’s phones and there will be no requirement for individuals to carry or be asked to produce it, said the government.
However, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” a statement said.
 
 

“This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key ‘pull factors’ for people who come to the UK illegally,” it added.
The government said the drive will also make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare, while streamlining access to tax records.
The announcement comes as Labour, the party in government, prepares to hold its annual conference, with Starmer under intense pressure, particularly over immigration.
“Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK … it will also offer ordinary citizens countless benefits,” Starmer said.
“We are doing the hard graft to deliver a fairer Britain for those who want to see change, not division,” he added.
The UK has traditionally resisted the idea of identity cards and does not have a central civilian registry or identification requirements in public.
The Conservative-led government in 2011 repealed legislation by Tony Blair’s government that created voluntary national identity cards and a resident registry database.
Political opposition
Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservatives, wrote on X that her party “will oppose any push by … the government to impose mandatory ID cards on law abiding citizens.
“We will not support any system that is mandatory for British people or excludes those of us who choose not to use it from any of the rights of our citizenship,” she added.
 






The left-wing Liberal Democrats also said that they “cannot support a mandatory digital digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives”.
And Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party that polls predict will form the next government, said: “I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.”
 






A petition demanding that ID cards not be introduced had collected more than 650,000 signatures early on Friday, but recent polling suggests majority support for the move among the public.
At the moment, UK citizens generally use driving licences, passports and utility bills as means of identification, depending on the situation.
The government says is “will listen to a range of views on how the service will be delivered”, as part of a public consultation to be launched later this year.
It also promised that the scheme will be available for those who aren’t able to use a smartphone.
“The public consultation will engage with groups who aren’t as experienced with the digital world, like the homeless and older people, learning from other countries that have done this well,” said the government statement.</p><small>2025-09-26 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/261419467cbd0c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944755/quetta-atc-refuses-to-extend-byc-chief-mahrang-balochs-physical-remand-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC refuses to extend BYC chief Mahrang Baloch’s physical remand: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday refused to extend the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers, according to the group’s lawyer.
Advocate Israr Jatak, a member of BYC’s legal team, told Dawn.com, “Quetta ATC-1 refused to extend the physical remand of five accused, namely Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Beberg Baloch and Gulzadi and ordered them to be sent to jail on judicial remand.”
In a hearing presided over by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Mahrang and others in court today after the completion of their 15-day physical remand granted on September 11.
Advocate Shoaib Mengal, along with Advocate Jatak, appeared in the court on behalf of the accused.
The CTD requested the court for an extension to the physical remand of the accused, but Judge Mubeen refused, asking for the accused to be handed over to jail custody.
On September 11, a Quetta ATC judge extended the physical remand of Dr Mahrang and other organisers of the group on the police’s request.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.  Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26143418efcd7b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944754/5-people-including-2-cops-injured-in-accidental-firing-at-balochistan-governors-residence-in-zhob-police' target='_blank'><strong>5 people, including 2 cops, injured in accidental firing at Balochistan governor’s residence in Zhob: police</strong></a><br><p>At least five people, including two cops, were injured on Friday in an accidental firing incident at the residence of Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Manndokhail in the province’s Zhob district, police said.
Speaking to the media, Zhob Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shaukat Mohmand said that three students and two police officers had been injured in the incident.
“The firing happened by mistake and was done by the station house officer’s gunman,” the police officer said. He added that the gunman had dropped his gun on the ground, which had resulted in it going off.
The injured students, who had come to meet the governor, were pupils at the Zhob Government Boys Degree College, he added.
The official said that the condition of all the injured people was stable and they had been taken to a nearby hospital for medical intervention.
According to initial investigations, police have termed the incident an accident, he said, adding that further investigation was underway.
Earlier this month, a teenage girl was killed when the gun she was cleaning accidentally went off at her home in Sindh’s Abdul Rehman Shar village.
Last year, a minor boy was killed on the spot in Karachi when the pistol of his father accidentally went off.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26140115f883548.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944753/million-year-old-skull-could-change-human-evolution-timeline' target='_blank'><strong>Million-year-old skull could change human evolution timeline</strong></a><br><p>A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia not Africa, a study said on Friday.
The findings are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990, and have the potential to resolve the longstanding “Muddle in the Middle” of human evolution, researchers said.
But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed, and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.
The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.
But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.
“This changes a lot of thinking,” said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.
“It suggests that by one million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,” he added.
If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the study says.
It also “muddies the waters” on longstanding assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University’s Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the research.
“There’s a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,” he told AFP.
‘A lot of questions’
The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2.
The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.
The resulting model “shows a distinctive combination of traits,” the study said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.
But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.
“Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what’s been called the “Muddle in the Middle”, the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,” Stringer said in a press release.
Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study’s findings were “provocative” though grounded in solid work.
“It’s sound, but I think the jury’s still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,” he said.
Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was “not always a perfect indicator for human evolution”.
“They’ve got this interpretation that I just don’t really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,” he told AFP.
The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we knew about our origins.
Homo longi, also known as “Dragon Man”, was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.
The authors said their work illustrates the complexity of our shared history.
“Fossils like Yunxian 2 show just how much we still have to learn about our origins,” said Stringer.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26133537f5d6f74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944746/imaan-mazari-files-grievance-letter-over-inaction-in-workplace-harassment-case-against-ihc-cj-dogar' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari files grievance letter over ‘inaction’ in workplace harassment case against IHC CJ Dogar</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir on Friday filed a grievance letter over “inaction” on her workplace harassment complaint against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
On Sept 15, Mazari approached an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), filing a complaint under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
As Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz took cognisance of Mazari’s complaint, the IHC  administration stripped the judge of her powers to entertain harassment complaints. Instead, IHC’s Justice  Inaam Ameen Minhas was appointed as the competent authority to oversee the case. This prompted Mazari to approach the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar’s shunting of a female judge for taking up a harassment complaint against him.
In today’s letter, addressed to Justice Minhas — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — Mazari said that the competent authority under the act was “required to communicate the charges to the accused within three days of receipt of the complaint, and the accused was required to submit a written defense within seven days from when the charge was communicated to him”.
“I am unaware of the status of my complaint, as I have not been informed by the competent authority in this regard,” she wrote.
Mazari called for a “clear urgency” to address the matter, saying, “I request redressal of my grievances at the earliest.”
She also brought up the matter of Justice Imtiaz’s removal as the competent authority and the appointment of Justice Minhas as a replacement, saying the move was “unlawful” as the “accused cannot alter the competent authority or impede my complaint by abusing his position of authority”.
She also highlighted “continuing acts of reprisal” by CJ Dogar following the complaint. “As you must be aware, such reprisals are strictly prohibited under the 2010 Act, and as competent authority, you are required to ensure that I am not subjected to such reprisals,” she said.
According to the letter, on Sept 16, Mazari’s client Mahrang Baloch’s case was fixed for a hearing before him, and Mazari’s proxy counsel requested a transfer of the case to any other bench due to the pending complaint.
“The accused refused to transfer the case, requiring me to appear before him despite the fact that under the law, no woman subjected to such treatment would be required to be in the presence of her alleged harasser,” she wrote.
“The aforementioned facts and circumstances clearly depict the brazen abuse of authority by the accused to shield himself from inquiry in my complaint,” she noted.
Mazari further said that her application seeking preservation of CCTV footage from the day of the incident remained “unanswered”, requesting “immediate intervention in securing this crucial evidence”.
Mazari had submitted an application to the IHC’s registrar for the preservation of CCTV footage of the “unfortunate incident” that took place with her.
In the application, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”</p><small>2025-09-26 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26124634a163f5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944745/at-least-11-dead-3-wounded-as-truck-crashes-in-kps-di-khan-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 dead, 3 wounded as truck crashes in KP’s DI Khan: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan, rescue 1122 said on Friday.

“The deceased include five women, a child, and a man,” he said, adding that the three injured were rushed to the District Headquarter Hospital DI Khan.“
He further said that the truck was travelling from the Khanozai area of Balochistan.
“Seven of the bodies were also taken to the hospital by the Rescue 1122 team, while four bodies were moved to the hospital by the local people,” he said.
The deceased people have not yet been identified.
Public Relations Officer of DI Khan Police Yaqoob Khan, in a statement, said, “Police are compiling a report for the identification of the deceased and arranging for the bodies to be handed over to their families.”
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days prior, on September 9,  five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur. The accident took place when a trailer en route to Rawalpindi collided with a car near the Maqsood interchange on the motorway.
In July, five people lost their lives in a collision between a car and a truck on Chashma Road in DI Khan district.</p><small>2025-09-26 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26115126d94b830.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944740/55-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-several-parts-of-kp' target='_blank'><strong>5.5-magnitude earthquake jolts several parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported that an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 was felt in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday morning.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
A report issued by the PMD said that the earthquake originated at 8:17am PKT today, with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 195 kilometres, at a latitude of 36.51 degrees north and longitude of 70.98° east.
Shocks were reported by the PMD to have been felt in Chitral, Peshawar and Swat, while the Pukhtunkhwa Times posted on X that “mild” tremors were also felt in Attock, Lower Dir and Upper Dir.
 






At the start of the month, a 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Afghanistan killed over 1,400 people and flattened homes, with tremors jolting KP and Punjab. However, no casualties or damages were reported in Pakistan.
A few days later, another earthquake of magnitude 5.9 originated in the Hindu Kush region, and was felt in the twin cities and parts of KP.</p><small>2025-09-26 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26033213329b18b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944526/pm-shehbaz-meets-trump-discusses-regional-security-counterterrorism-in-landmark-visit-to-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Trump, discusses regional security, counterterrorism in landmark visit to White House</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US President Donald Trump discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters, as the two met for the first time at the Oval Office in Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, according to a press release from the PM Office.
The premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as per an earlier statement from the PM office.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for “his public endorsement of Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and stressed the need to further enhance cooperation in security and intelligence,” as the two discussed matters of regional security.
The premier described Trump as a “man of peace”, lauding his “sincere” efforts in ending conflicts around the world. PM Shehbaz branded Trump’s style of leadership “bold, courageous and decisive,” and thanked the US president for his role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in their four-day military conflict in May.
He helped “avert a major catastrophe in South Asia,” the statement quoted the PM as saying.
“The Prime Minister also extended a warm and cordial invitation to President Trump to undertake an official visit to Pakistan, at his convenience,” the PM office said.
On the situation in the Middle East, PM Shehbaz “lauded President Trump’s efforts to bring about an immediate end to the war in Gaza, especially his initiative to invite key leaders of the Muslim world in New York, earlier this week, for a comprehensive exchange of views for restoration of peace in the Middle East, in particular Gaza and the West Bank.”
Thanking Trump for the recent tariff agreement signed with Pakistan, PM Shehbaz hoped that “under President Trump’s leadership, the Pakistan-US partnership would be further strengthened to the mutual benefit of both countries.”
“In this regard, the Prime Minister invited the US Companies to invest in Pakistan’s agriculture, IT, mines and minerals and energy sectors,” the PM Office added.
Photos released after the meeting showed both PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir exchanging views with Trump. Trump was also all smiles as he flashed his signature thumbs up sign during a group photo.
 






The meeting, which was closed to the press, was originally slated to begin at 4:30pm Washington time (1:30am PST) but was delayed by approximately 30 minutes as the US president spoke to reporters after signing executive orders. The meeting itself lasted approximately one hour and 20 minutes.
Photos from the White House press pool before it began showed PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir waiting patiently on the Oval Office’s gold-gilded furniture as, across the room, the US president wrapped up his previous engagement.

The army chief could also be seen speaking to White House staffers as media personnel packed up their equipment. When US Secretary of State Rubio entered the room, he could be seen enthusiastically greeting both leaders.
The visit, the first formal bilateral interaction between the two leaders, comes six years after former premier Imran Khan met Trump during the latter’s first term in July 2019.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.
President Trump was also conscious of the delay, telling the media: “They are coming and they may be in this room right now. I don’t know because we are late.”

The meeting itself, however, was closed to the press — a break from Trump’s usual modus operandi, as he is known for inviting select cameras and reporters into the Oval Office for photo-ops.
Radio Pakistan reported earlier that the two were “expected to discuss matters of mutual interest as well as regional and global situation”.
The development comes as the premier is in the US for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. During his whirlwind tour, PM Shehbaz has attended UNGA sessions, a key multilateral summit of the Muslim bloc, as well as side meetings with the heads of international financial institutions in New York.
The premier will now make his way back to New York, as he is due to address the UN General Assembly on Friday.
‘Pak-US ties gradually warming up’
Earlier, at a media briefing in New York, a senior State Department official told Dawn that ties between Washington and Islamabad were “gradually warming up” in Trump’s second term.
For years, the United States had viewed India as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in Asia, while Pakistan was seen as a close Chinese ally.
Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, US relations with India have come under strain over visa hurdles for Indians, steep tariffs imposed by Washington on Indian goods, and the president’s repeated claim that he personally brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May following cross-border hostilities.
The senior official emphasised that US relations with Pakistan were not tied to its partnership with India.
“We have an independent relationship with Pakistan,” he said, recalling recent American investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Pakistan’s mineral sector, and noting continued US interest in petroleum exploration.
Responding to a question, the official added that Washington was still reviewing the recently concluded defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
On July 31, the two countries announced a trade agreement under which the US imposed a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods. Trump has yet to finalise a similar deal with India. Analysts note that in response to tensions with Washington, New Delhi has begun recalibrating its ties with China as a hedge.
Earlier this year, Trump welcomed Field Marshal Munir to the White House — the first time a US president hosted Pakistan’s military leader without senior civilian officials present, underscoring the military’s central role in bilateral relations.
“We’re working through a number of issues when it comes to counterterrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” the senior State Department official said when asked about Pakistan.
 
 

“And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.”
On India, the official said Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in the relationship but still considered it strong. Washington, he added, continued to see New Delhi as “a good friend and partner” whose ties with the US would “define the 21st century”.
Islamabad has publicly backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to defuse tensions with India, even as it has condemned Israeli bombardments in Gaza, Qatar and Iran.
Prime Minister Sharif also joined Trump on Tuesday in a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries, where the US president discussed Israel’s assault on Gaza and shared American peace proposals on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
PM Shehbaz meets Bangladesh’s Yunus
Prior to the meeting with Trump, PM Shehbaz also met Bangladesh’s chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus, in New York, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.
In this meeting, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening “constructive and forward-looking ties” with Bangladesh, rooted in mutual respect, trust and shared aspirations of regional peace and prosperity, the Radio Pakistan report said.
The two leaders reviewed the current state of Pakistan-Bangladesh bilateral relations, discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in areas including trade, regional connectivity and people-to-people exchanges, it added.
For his part, Yunus appreciated Pakistan’s initiative to deepen engagement and highlighted the importance of enhancing bilateral trade and cultural linkage, it said.

ISLAMABAD: An Inter­national Mone­tary Fund (IMF) review mission began its work simultaneously in Karachi and Islamabad on Thursday, holding discussions with authorities on mixed programme performance without the customary opening engagement with Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is currently on a visit to the United States.
Sources said the introductory meeting with Mr Aurangzeb, initially scheduled for Sept 25, has now been moved to Monday (Sept 29) in his absence. In the meantime, two IMF teams — one dealing with monetary policy and the other with fiscal policy — are engaged with the State Bank of Pakistan and federal government entities.
 
 

The mission is expected to stay for about two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions, pressing the authorities to expedite implementation of end-December 2025 targets.
According to the sources, the government has already used one-third of the Rs390 billion budgetary allocation for natural disasters and emergencies, clearing Rs130bn in past dues owed to commercial banks for incentives and fees linked to remittances sent through formal channels.
The government will now have to justify these payments from the emergency fund at a time when it is also seeking relaxations from the IMF on account of flood damages. Moreover, no allocation has been made in the current budget for such incentives, though an estimated Rs100bn would be required.
The IMF mission also expects clarity on the scale of recent flood damages during its stay, but the government has yet to finalise estimates. Authorities are hoping the Fund will allow relaxations in primary budget surplus and fiscal deficit targets to create space for flood-related expenditure without resorting to new taxes or cuts in development spending.
 
 

The government has missed several key end-June 2025 targets, including FBR’s revenue collection, retail taxation and provincial cash surpluses, and could face difficulties on these counts.
At the same time, the governance and corruption diagnostic report — pending with the authorities for review and publication — has still not been released, leaving the associated governance action plan in limbo. Progress on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) governance reforms has also stalled, despite commitments made with the IMF.
Although provincial legislatures successfully enacted agriculture income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection from September-October remains uncertain, especially given the flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. This uncertainty also clouds the government’s ability to assess and deliver the required support for flood-affected people, sectors and facilities.
 
 

On the positive side, Pakistan has almost met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025, but it continues to lag behind on indicative targets and structural benchmarks. These gaps could affect the pace of implementation in the months ahead.
Since the $7bn Extended Fund Facility and $1.4bn climate-linked Resilience & Sustainability Facility are reviewed twice a year, both sides will have to reach an agreement on past performance as well as future commitments.
If the review is successfully concluded, Pakistan will qualify for disbursement of about $1bn (equivalent to 760 million IMF special drawing rights) by the end of next month.

This helped the government to start the new fiscal year on a healthy note, unlike last year’s lacklustre beginning in the absence of IMF support.
The total inflows, both loans and grants, in the first two months of the current fiscal year amounted to $1.377bn when compared to $714m last year, showing an increase of 93pc. Inflows in August alone amounted to $680m, almost 152pc higher than last year’s $270m in the same month. In July this year, a total of $698m loans and grants flowed into the country compared to $444m in the same month last year, representing a 57pc increase.
The $1.345bn in foreign loans and $33m in grants in the first two months of the fiscal year flowing into the country were about 103pc higher and 31pc lower than last year’s $662m loans and $43m grants, respectively, as finalisation of the Extended Fund Facility with the IMF was taking time and later materialized after the budget approval.

Boost from IMF support helps Pakistan secure $1.345bn in loans and $33m in grants

The target for total foreign inflows for the current year has been set at $19.9bn compared to $19.4bn last year.
In July-August 2023, Pakistan was able to materialise more than $3.2bn mainly due to signing of the 9-month Stand-By Agreement (SBA) with the IMF. As a result, Pakistan received a major injection of $2bn in time deposits from Saudi Arabia. In fact, total inflows in July 2023 amounted to $5.1bn, which also included $1.2bn from the IMF and an$1bn from the UAE.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday said that it had received a total of $1.377bn in foreign inflows in the first two months of FY26 compared to $714m in the same period last year.
The EAD said that out of $1.377bn inflows, the 465.4bn were received for project financing compared to $441m in first two months of last year, showing a nominal increase of almost 6pc. The non-project loans amounted to $912m in two months compared to $272m last year, showing a massive growth of almost 235pc.
This meant about $680m loans were received in two months for budget support compared to just $272m in the same period last year, showing an about 150pc increase in inflows for budget financing. This is despite the fact that the annual target for budget support this year was set at $13.5bn compared to $15bn last year.
 
 

The authorities were also able to materialise $200m against the Saudi oil facility in the first two months, at a rate of $100m each month, for the fiscal year, against an annual target of $1bn.
Against a full-year target of $5bn from multilaterals (excluding IMF), Pakistan got $780m in two months from multilateral lenders against $293m of the same period last year, when the annual target was $4.5bn.
Total inflows from bilateral lenders (excluding three strategic and friendly countries) in the first two months of the year totalled $232m, against an annual target of $1.36bn. This was 43pc higher than the $162m recorded in the same period last year, when the full-year target was $523m.
Total inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders amounted to $1.013m in two months of this year against the annual target of $6.4bn. Last year, the government secured $456m from bilateral and multilateral sources against the annual target of $5.05bn.
Inflows from overseas Pakistanis increased to $365m in the first two months of the current year in the shape of Naya Pakistan Certificates, up from $259m last year. The government has estimated a total of $609m through these certificates during the current year.
The full year $19.9bn target for the current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from both multilateral and bilateral lenders, including $5.05bn from multilaterals and $1.36bn from bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn foreign commercial loans, $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn SAFE deposit from China.
