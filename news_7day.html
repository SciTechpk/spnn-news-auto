<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19131236ec5090a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974353/demarche-issued-to-afghanistan-over-terror-attack-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Demarche issued to Afghanistan over terror attack in KP’s Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers, it emerged on Thursday.
According to a press release by the Foreign Office (FO), the demarche was issued on Wednesday afternoon when the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission.
“Pakistan condemned in the strongest possible terms the vehicle-borne suicide terrorist attack followed by a fire raid on Pakistan military and law enforcement agencies’ posts in Bajaur, carried out by Fitna al Khawarij [or] the TTP,” the statement said.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO expressed concern that the group, whose entire leadership is based in Afghanistan, “operates with impunity from Afghan soil”.
It re-emphasised that Pakistan had received repeated assurances from the Afghan Taliban regime, “but, regrettably, with no visible or concrete actions”.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership,” the press release said.
The ministry also “categorically informed” the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserved the right to respond and eliminate any khawarij belonging to the group as well as their affiliates”, wherever they were located, “to ensure [the] safety of its soldiers, civilians and territorial boundaries”.
It is worth mentioning that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that Islamabad will not hesitate to launch air operations inside Afghanistan to combat militancy, characterising the current regional instability as the “price we are paying” for decisions made during the 1980s and after Sept 11 terrorist attacks.
Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Asif accused the Afghan Taliban regime of conducting a “proxy war” alongside India against Pakistani interests and said military action would remain on the table until Kabul offered meaningful “assurances of peace”, according to a BBC report.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a terror attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur martyred 11 security personnel on Monday.
The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khawarij with precision”.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms”.
Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.</p><small>2026-02-19 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19143219289f4f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974356/want-a-healthy-iftar-this-ramazan-ditch-the-sugary-sweets-for-these-options' target='_blank'><strong>Want a healthy iftar this Ramazan? Ditch the sugary sweets for these options</strong></a><br><p>One of the most anticipated moments of Ramazan in many homes is iftar and its preparation. After a long day of fasting and prayers, naturally, everyone wishes to break their fast with their desired foods.
However, to keep ourselves healthy this Ramazan, it’s essential for our iftar menus to focus on what the body needs for its recovery instead of what solely tastes good on the palate. Don’t worry, this is not another list of things you already know; this one might surprise you.
Hydration
Almost every fasting individual has been told about how crucial drinking water during iftar is, and of course, that remains true, but there are some other options that can assist with the role of hydration during iftar besides just drinking water.
Cucumbers are one of the most hydrating foods, with their composition being over 90 per cent water. They are available in our local markets almost all year round, and should be a great addition to everyone’s iftar menus this Ramazan.

It might come as a surprise to some, but lettuce is also an extremely hydrating vegetable, with its water content being nearly the same as that of cucumbers. It might be difficult to incorporate cucumbers everywhere, but lettuces are much more diverse and can be added to a variety of items, from salads to wraps and much more.
Sweet cravings
After breaking the fast, many people tend to crave something sweet for iftar.
While such cravings are commonly met by sugary sweets, that is not what the body is truly asking for. The body requires items that won’t lead to a sugar spike followed by a crash. Foods like oranges, dates and chia seeds can assist here.

Dates have been the oldest occupant of iftar menus across the world, and for good reason. Though small in size, dates should not be ignored as they have a very high sugar and fibre content. Since the sugar is natural, it allows healthy absorption in the body and the fibres aid digestion after a long day of fasting.

Oranges are also a great source of natural sugar. They may not have been very common during iftar, especially for Ramazan in summer, but it’s winter in many parts of the world right now, so they are readily available. Not only do oranges have high water and Vitamin C content, but they’re also high in fibre, making them easy to digest.
While not sweet on their own, chia seeds can be incorporated with other sweet items in many ways to make those items healthier. They are an excellent source of fibre and hydration for iftar, as they also absorb large amounts of water and aid digestion. They can be added to a variety of different desserts with yoghurt, peanut butter, and literally any other ingredient, or used as a “topping” too.
Gut health
While we have all surely heard of the good old warning of avoiding fried food and store-bought items, rarely do we ever pay heed to it.
It is understandable that sacrificing certain fried foods is difficult for many during iftar, but switching to some different cooking techniques and appliances can make these items healthier, especially for our gut after a long fast.
Instead of frying in oil or deep frying, using an air fryer can be a healthier alternative, as no oil is involved. Air frying is also much quicker and doesn’t require constant monitoring. Alternate cooking methods like baking, steaming, or grilling the same foods that we would oil fry can make them healthier for iftar too.
Oats are often despised by many, but they can be used in diverse ways. Popular foods like haleem and khichri can be made healthier if cooked with oats instead of their usual ingredients.

The difference in taste is hardly noticeable, but the health benefits are immense. Oats also have a very high fibre content and absorb sufficient water to keep the body hydrated. They prevent bloating and the “crash-out” caused by consuming other complex carbs like rice or bread.
How to eat
While the things we eat control our health during Ramazan, the method and order of consuming the different items on the iftar table also have a big impact on health.
It is important to begin with dates and water instead of juices or any other solid food. The dates allow a stable blood sugar rise while the water provides cells with hydration so that they can effectively work to digest the rest of the foods coming after.

It’s also very important to eat slowly, as the digestive system has been idle for a long time. Having some items first and leaving the rest to eat after finishing the Maghrib prayer is also a good option, to allow the body time to adjust and prevent drowsiness post iftar.
If we decide on healthy iftar habits right from the start, we will have a much easier and healthier time this Ramazan.

The February 6 attack, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, on the outskirts of the capital was the deadliest in Islamabad since a 2008 truck bombing that killed 60 people at the Marriott Hotel.
“Relief cheques have been delivered to the heirs of 36 martyrs belonging to Islamabad,” PMO said in a statement, adding each victim’s family received Rs5m.
Cheques will also be delivered to four families of victims living outside Islamabad, the statement said.
Although officials have not released a final death toll, the statement marked the first official acknowledgement that 40 people were killed in the blast.
On Feb 11, PM Shehbaz had announced compensation for those martyred and injured in the suicide attack while visiting the site of the attack.
Speaking on the occasion, he said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.”
The suicide attack occurred during Friday prayers. The last major attack in Islamabad took place in November when a suicide blast outside a court killed 12 people and wounded dozens, the first such incident to hit the capital in nearly three years.</p><small>2026-02-19 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19141643b9213f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974355/pakistan-hockey-federation-president-resigns-blames-sports-board-for-pro-league-mismanagement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Hockey Federation president resigns, blames sports board for Pro League mismanagement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) president Tariq Hussain Bugti announced his resignation on Thursday, citing mismanagement by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) in handling funds for international tournaments, particularly the International Hockey Federation (FIH) Pro League.
He stated that his resignation has already been submitted to the prime minister.
Blaming the sports board for the crisis, he said funds allocated for the Pro League were released to the PSB but were not managed properly, resulting in logistical problems during tours of Argentina and Australia.
Bugti maintained that the federation had shared schedules of the tours in advance and that financial control rested with the PSB.
“After seven years, Pakistan hockey finally got a chance to play in the Pro League, but due to lack of funds, we struggled to meet obligations,” he said, adding that he personally paid $3,720 to clear outstanding hotel dues in Argentina.
He also called for an independent inquiry, stating that the committee formed by the PSB had acted as “judge and jury”.
Referring to internal matters, he alleged that the team captain had pressured players by showing them messages from influential figures, after which the federation imposed a two-year ban on Ammad Shakeel Butt.
Regarding funding, he said PM Shehbaz Sharif had allocated Rs250 million for hockey, which was released to the PSB. “Despite this, the hockey federation faced major logistical challenges abroad,” he added.
He concluded by saying that mere resignation was not sufficient. “Pakistan’s reputation has been damaged, and accountability must be ensured.”
The resignation follows a public row between the PHF and the PSB over alleged mismanagement during the national team’s participation in the second leg of the FIH Pro League in Hobart, Australia.
The Green Shirts returned to Lahore after suffering defeats against Germany and Australia, ending a winless campaign.
While the PHF maintained that logistical and financial responsibility rested with the PSB under Senate committee directives, a PSB official countered that sufficient funds had been provided and questioned the federation’s handling of arrangements.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took notice of the matter and ordered an immediate inquiry, while Federal Minister Rana Sanaullah constituted a committee to investigate the issue.
Both sides have welcomed the probe, though observers have called for a neutral and independent investigation to ensure transparency.</p><small>2026-02-19 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19091152af49b0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974336/at-least-16-killed-in-karachi-soldier-bazaar-building-collapse-following-gas-explosion' target='_blank'><strong>At least 16 killed in Karachi Soldier Bazaar building collapse following gas explosion</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: At least 16 people, including women and children, were killed, and 14 were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area, according to rescue officials.
The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jamshed Asher said the incident occurred at around 4:15am during Sehri, and that the gas explosion took place on the building’s first floor.
In an update, Sindh Rescue 1122 said the death toll in the incident had reached 16, while 14 were injured. According to the director of Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre, Dr Mohammad Sabir Memon, 13 of the bodies had been brought to his hospital.
Rescue 1122 said that search and rescue operations are ongoing, with an urban search and rescue team and a disaster response vehicle present at the scene.
Speaking to the media, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh also confirmed that a gas explosion was the cause of the structure’s partial collapse.
He noted that the ground plus two-floor structure had small rooms, and the limited space made the rescue operation challenging.
“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” said the senior rescue official, adding that the collapse also damaged surrounding structures.
According to a list of casualties provided by Rescue 1122, the deceased comprise eight minors, four women and four men — aged between two and 60 years. The injured included seven minors.
A District East police spokesperson said a large contingent of law enforcers, along with rescue teams, reached the scene soon after the incident was reported.
“Police cordoned off the area and tightened security, while rescue agencies initiated a search and rescue operation,” said the police spokesperson.
CM takes notice; temporary rehabilitation ordered
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released by the CM House.
The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance.
Murad also ordered that all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident.







Adviser to CM for Rehabilitation Giyan Chand Essrani, as per a statement from his office, sought reports from Rescue 1122 and the relevant departments over the incident.
“The Rehabilitation Department’s teams are present at the site of the incident to provide immediate relief, temporary accommodation and basic necessities to the affected families,” Essrani said.
He affirmed that his department was working under a “comprehensive plan to provide complete rehabilitation, mental health assistance and necessary facilities” to the affected families.
“The temporary rehabilitation and safe relocation of the affected building’s occupants and nearby residents should be ensured,” Essrani stated.

Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also expressed grief over the incident. He directed authorities to accelerate the pace of rescue efforts and ensure proper medical care for the injured citizens, said a statement from the minister’s office.
“All updates and details of the relief work should be regularly reported, the home minister directed,” added the statement.
Conveying his condolences, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government shared the grief of the bereaved families.
He urged citizens to be cautious while using gas and to immediately contact the relevant authorities if they suspected a gas leakage.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also expressed his condolences over the gas explosion, assuring the affected people of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) support.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis.
The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure.
In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi.
A month later, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured, with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town.
In June 2024, following the death of 27 persons, including 19 children, in an explosion in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling shop in Hyderabad, the Sindh government had decided to shift all such facilities from residential areas.</p><small>2026-02-19 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191329504c818b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974354/bill-gates-pulls-out-of-india-ai-summit-anger-mounts-over-organisational-lapses' target='_blank'><strong>Bill Gates pulls out of India AI summit; anger mounts over organisational lapses</strong></a><br><p>Bill Gates pulled out of India’s AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational lapses, a robot row and complaints of traffic chaos.
Gates’ absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance.
The Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address “to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities”.
Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for children’s safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.
“We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,” Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives and posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength.
The photoshoot produced an awkward moment when Altman and Amodei, chiefs of rival AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, stood side by side on stage but did not hold hands, although the other executives did.
India’s first major AI summit has been marred by organisational lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government.
Chaos and traffic snarls
Gates’ cancellation comes after the US Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Gates Foundation’s staff.
Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein.
The summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions. The venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event.
Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, sparking a public uproar.
Police repeatedly shut roads to give preference to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million people. The Indian government has apologised for the inconvenience caused to attendees in the initial days.
But on Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut, with no availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged.
Opposition parties attacked the government and the prime minister for poorly managing the global summit.
“How can you expect your engineers, AI guys, to walk such distances…And then we complain that entrepreneurs are leaving India,” said Pawan Khera, the Congress party spokesperson.
Still, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta.
The Indian government has said it expects total pledges to exceed $200bn in the next two years, although analysts have warned that the rapid build-out risks straining India’s power grid and water supply.</p><small>2026-02-19 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19122614e294c2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974351/ihc-issues-notices-to-nccia-on-imaan-hadis-appeals-against-convictions-in-social-media-post-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues notices to NCCIA on Imaan, Hadi’s appeals against convictions in social media post case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued notices to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on appeals filed by Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, against their conviction in the controversial tweets case.
Justice Muhammad Asif, who heard the appeals, also issued notices on the couple’s applications seeking suspension of their sentence and called for a response from the agency.
The IHC then adjourned further proceedings, observing that a date for the next hearing would be fixed.
On January 24, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
The lawyer duo was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment under Peca’s Section 10 (cyberterrorism), five years’ jail under Section 9 (glorification of an offence) and two years in prison under Section 26-A (false and fake information).
All sentences will run concurrently.
Appearing on behalf of the appellants, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, along with Zainab Janjua and other members of the defence team, contended that the trial court announced its verdict while a transfer application was still pending before the IHC.
Siddiqui argued that two prosecution witnesses were examined in the absence of the accused and questioned the manner in which the trial judge subsequently expunged a paragraph from the judgment.

 

“Punishment may be awarded ten times over, but a fair trial must first be conducted,” Siddiqui contended, stressing that due process had been compromised.
Justice Asif remarked that notices were being issued and directed that the paper books be prepared.
Siddiqui requested an early date for the hearing of the suspension of sentence applications, pointing that he travelled from Karachi to appear before the court, and sought a Monday or Tuesday date.
The judge responded that an appropriate date would be fixed.
The IHC subsequently issued notices to the NCCIA and sought the agency’s reply before adjourning the matter.
On February 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order convicting them. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements.
They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”.
Imaan and Chattha’s convictions had sparked concerns from the United Nations Human Rights Office, a team of UN special rapporteurs, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and a European Union (EU) official.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.

 

It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the banned outfits Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.</p><small>2026-02-19 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191115575039f37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974344/white-house-tells-iran-to-do-deal-as-trump-hints-at-us-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>White House tells Iran to do deal as Trump hints at US strikes</strong></a><br><p>The White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be “wise” to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military buildup underway in the Middle East.
He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago’s Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime”.
CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper.
Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was “drafting” a framework for future talks with the US.
Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva.
Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.
‘Do not want war’
Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted “we do not want war” but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands.
“From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside.
But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?”
Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In the call, the Iranian foreign minister “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks”, according to a statement from his ministry.







Tehran has suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.
Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”.
“They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons.
It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency.
Displays of military might
The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy.
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas.
On Tuesday, state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191210182e2f8a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974349/pakistan-extends-airspace-closure-for-indian-aircraft-until-march-23' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace closure for Indian aircraft until March 23</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday extended the airspace restrictions on Indian aircraft till March 23.
The airspace will remain closed for all Indian civil and military registered aircraft till March 23, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) said in a new notice to airmen (Notam) issued today.
Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April 2025 in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.
New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe. Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict.
Amid a financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan, it was reported in November that Air India was lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19115453f013c20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974348/eight-backcountry-skiers-perish-in-california-avalanche-ninth-presumed-dead' target='_blank'><strong>Eight backcountry skiers perish in California avalanche, ninth presumed dead</strong></a><br><p>Eight backcountry skiers were confirmed killed and a ninth was presumed to have perished when their tour group was overtaken by a football-pitch-sized avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains on Tuesday, in the deadliest US avalanche in 45 years, authorities said.
Six survivors were rescued after search teams on skis fought through blinding snow, darkness, treacherous terrain and gale-force winds to reach them in the rugged Castle Peak area near Truckee, California, about 10 miles (16km) north-west of Lake Tahoe.

The group of 15 skiers, including four guides from outfitter Blackbird Mountain Guides, was heading back to a trailhead in heavy snow after a three-day excursion when the avalanche struck around 11:30am PT on Tuesday.
The surviving skiers, who took refuge in a makeshift shelter constructed partly from tarpaulin sheets after the avalanche, used emergency beacons and text messaging to communicate their location to rescuers.
One of the guides was among the survivors, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a press conference.
Two rescue teams totalling about 50 people were dispatched from the Boreal Mountain Ski Resort and the Tahoe Donner resort’s Alder Creek Adventure Centre and approached the avalanche zone from the south and north.
High risk of avalanche
The rescuers themselves faced life-threatening conditions, with the risk of further avalanches still high after a winter storm dropped several feet of fresh, unstable snow in recent days.
Responders were able to get within two miles (3.2km) of the avalanche site on a snowcat vehicle, then switched to skis to lessen the risk of triggering another deadly slide.
“Extreme weather conditions, I would say, is an understatement,” said Moon, whose office helped oversee the search mission.
An adjacent stretch of the US Interstate 80 highway had been closed during the rescue operation due to zero visibility from the storm.
Bodies of eight skiers were located but will be recovered at a later date when weather permits, while a ninth skier from the group remained missing and was presumed dead, authorities said.

One of the deceased skiers was the spouse of a search-and-rescue team member, authorities said. An injured skier was being treated in a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The tour group, which included nine women and six men, had been staying at the Frog Lake Backcountry Huts near Donner Summit north-west of Truckee, at about 7,500 feet elevation (2,300 meters). The area is a popular destination for backcountry skiers.
In a typical winter, the mountain receives more than 400 inches (10.16 m) of snow, making it one of the snowiest places in the Western Hemisphere.
Moon said the storm and avalanche danger were predicted and her office was talking with the guide company about its decision to take people out.
The Sierra Avalanche Center extended the avalanche warning it issued on Tuesday, saying a “high” danger might continue throughout Wednesday.
Comparatively high casualty toll
Avalanches have claimed an average of 27 lives each winter in the United States over the past decade, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which tallied six US avalanche fatalities so far this season before Tuesday’s disaster.
One person was killed by an avalanche in the Frog Lake area in January.
Tuesday’s calamity was notable for its comparatively high casualty toll. It marked the greatest loss of life on record in the US from a single avalanche since a 1981 ice slide on Mount Rainier in Washington state killed 11 people as they were climbing the Ingraham Glacier, according to the Colorado centre’s director, Ethan Greene.

In 1982, seven people died in a massive avalanche that struck the Alpine Meadows ski resort in California, also near the north-western shore of Lake Tahoe.
Greene said it was far too soon to understand all the circumstances around the latest disaster but noted the heavy snowfall and avalanche dangers were “well forecast.”
Venturing out on skis in avalanche country in the midst of a major storm is “not something we would be advising people to do, especially in a guided group.”
He also said ski groups normally try to limit exposure to a particularly slide-prone section of terrain to no more than one skier at a time so that if one person becomes trapped in an avalanche, others in the group can work to quickly locate and dig out the victim.
Blackbird issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was working with authorities to support the rescue operation. The company referred questions to local authorities on Wednesday.
Blackbird was founded in 2020 and operates in California, Washington state and British Columbia in Canada as well as numerous popular skiing spots abroad, according to its website. The company provides guided ski trips, alpine climbing trips and avalanche education.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19100217d398d67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974341/no-leniency-attaullah-tarar-refutes-reports-of-deal-offered-to-pti-founder-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>‘No leniency’: Attaullah Tarar refutes reports of ‘deal’ offered to PTI founder Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday strongly rejected media speculations regarding any “deal” between the government and incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
In a statement shared on X, Tarar said, “There is neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran.”
He added that any impression of the government granting the ex-premier concessions was “entirely false and misleading”.







“Imran Khan is a criminal convicted by courts, and the reports about  leniency for him are baseless,” Tarar asserted.
“There is no truth in these reports.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was months ago convicted in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Tarar’s clarification follows recent statements made by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, wherein he said efforts were made to reach a solution, but Imran was not ready for “any deal”.
“He (Imran) is not ready for any deal,” Sanaullah said in an interview with ARY News aired on Wednesday.
“Two very serious efforts were made [and] not only is he not ready for a deal but his demands are such that the current government cannot fulfil them,” he added.
Sanaullah described the PTI founder as having a “non-political attitude” and being “stubborn”. “The way they (PTI supporters) say that he is standing tall,” he quipped.
According to the PML-N leader, “one serious effort” was made between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the aftermath of the November 2024 protests.

 

“On the second [effort], I cannot go into details more than this that some individuals had arrived from abroad,” Sanaullah said, adding that they “had links” with Imran.
“They also met with Imran Khan sahib, and as per my information, Imran Khan sahib first agreed with them, but then he stepped back from it.”
In January 2026, Sanaullah had said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government but Imran opposed the move.



On Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also denied any kind of “deal” with Imran, claiming that the latter wanted a deal and concession since day one.
“We are also ready for talks, but we will not accept any blackmail in this regard. The only reason for sending Imran Khan abroad for treatment can be that, God forbid, he may be suffering from a life-threatening disease that cannot be treated here,” he had said.
His statement came amid concerns raised by the PTI about the party founder’s health after a report submitted to the Supreme Court quoted him as saying he had lost partial vision in his right eye due to an ailment.</p><small>2026-02-19 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/190947212e46649.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974340/pm-shehbaz-lands-in-washington-for-inaugural-meeting-of-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lands in Washington for inaugural meeting of Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Washington DC on Thursday on an official visit to the United States, at the invitation of US President Donald Trump to attend the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier as part of the Pakistani delegation.

 


The prime minister will participate in the Board of Peace session in Washington today. He is also expected to hold meetings with senior US officials during the visit.
According to an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the visit reflects Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace, its “effective role for the promotion of global peace” and what it described as the country’s growing diplomatic outreach.
“In addition to attending the inaugural session of the BoP, the prime minister will also engage with senior US leadership, as well as his counterparts attending the meeting,” said a press release by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dated Feb 18.
It added that the occasion would provide an opportunity for discussions on bilateral matters, as well as global issues of mutual concern.







All 22 invitees to the meeting have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The summit’s immediate focus is expected to be threefold: consolidating a ceasefire in Gaza, mobilising financial pledges for the BoP — with Washin­gton announcing an initial commitment of $5 billion — and finalising the contours of a proposed global forum that Trump hopes can achieve what the United Nations could not.
Participants are also likely to discuss the proposed International Stab­ilisation Force (ISF), tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.

It also submitted that the under-construction thoroughfares were excluded from e-ticketing system till the completion of development work and installation/upgradation of road infrastructure.  
The comments were filed on the behalf of deputy inspector general of police (traffic) in one of several identical petitions filed against implementation of e-challan system in Karachi.  
It further said that the provincial government had already provided relief by allowing 50 per cent discount if the challan was paid within 14 days and traffic courts were also being set up to ensure transparency.  
After taking the comments on record, a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed adjourned the hearing till March 12 as a provincial law officer sought more time to file comments on the behalf of other respondents.  
Citing the chief secretary Sindh, secretary home department, excise and taxation department, inspector general of Sindh police, DIG traffic police and others as respondents, the petitioners asserted that the Al-based e-challan system was implemented in the city without ensuring necessary road infrastructure, vehicle ownership verification mechanism and other allied facilities.

ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The Islamabad High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Human Rights on a petition challenging the vires of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2026, and sought their response.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC heard the petition filed by Advocate Abdul Wahab Farid against the recently enacted law.
During the hearing, counsel for the petitioner, Maham Fatima and Sardar Tariq Hussain, arg­ued that the impugned legislation was contrary to several constitutional provisions, including Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 35 and 227. They contended that the law infringes fundamental rights and is inconsistent with Islamic injunctions.

 

The counsel submitted that the procedure prescribed under the new law for registration and redressal of complaints violates the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution. They further argued that certain provisions confer excessive and arbitrary powers that could be misused and undermine due process.
After a preliminary hearing, Justice Tahir issued notices to the respondents and adjourned further proceedings until a date to be fixed by the office.
Man convicted
Meanwhile, a model criminal court (minor offences) in Lahore issued a judgement Wednesday in a domestic abuse case, convicting a man of assaulting his wife and mother-in-law.
Judicial Magistrate Hamidul Rahman Nasir conducted the trial, which involved testimony from several witnesses, including the victims and police investigators.
The incident took place on April 2, 2021. According to the FIR, the conflict began when the man allegedly pressured his wife to seek employment against her wishes. When she refused, he and several of his family members reportedly began beating her.
Following a telephone call from the wife, her mother and brother arrived at the scene.
The prosecution argued that during the ensuing confrontation, the man assaulted his mother-in-law, tearing her clothes and beating her until she lost consciousness. Neighbours eventually intervened to rescue the victims.
The FIR stated that after only two months of marriage, the husband began subjecting his wife to routine physical abuse. As a result, she stayed at her parents’ house for about eight months and received medical treatment at their expense.
The defence contended that the FIR was fabricated and pointed to the absence of official medico-legal certificates.
However, the prosecution explained that hospital protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic and police negligence contributed to the lack of formal documentation.
The magistrate found the man guilty under Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which addresses assault or use of criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty.
In the judgement announced on Tuesday, the magistrate sentenced the husband to three months’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1,500 for assaulting his wife. He was also awarded another three months’ rigorous imprisonment for assaulting his mother-in-law, along with a fine of Rs1,500.

France and Germany have called for Francesca Albanese to step down over remarks in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.
Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”.
In response to a question about the comments, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Feb 11 told parliament she should step down.
In an open letter, the former diplomats criticised what they called “the use of inaccurate and manipulated elements to discredit a holder of an independent UN mandate”.
They called on Barrot to “retract his inaccurate statements about Ms Albanese and correct them.”
“This controversy must not divert attention from the massacres of civilians, nor from the humanitarian crisis and the massive human rights violations taking place in Gaza,” said the signatories.
The letter, written in French, was signed by mostly former foreign ministers and diplomats from the Netherlands.
More than a dozen current members of parliament and senators from Europe were also among the signatories, along with a former foreign minister of South Africa.
Columbia University activist
A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to US media reports.
Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen. Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses.

I have been on the roads for 14 years… I have grown old, and people have to hold my hand while disembarking from a vehicle. But I protest here so that I get justice.”
These are the words of the late Bibi Houri, immortalised in a brief clip that has been circulating on social media since her demise.
Since 2012, when her son went missing in Balochistan, Bibi Houri had been a regular fixture at demonstrations staged by relatives of missing persons. Despite her advanc­­ed years, she would sit from dawn to dusk at the protest camps, pining for her son Gul Mohammad Marri and hoping for his safe recovery.
The widow, in her 70s, who broke with societal norms by coming out of her home and seeking justice — on the roads, in court, and at police stations — breathed her last on Tuesday.

Septuagenarian had been campaigning for her missing son’s recovery since 2012

“She used to come to the missing persons’ camp along with her missing son’s daughter — even on Eid,” recalled Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP).
Bibi Houri — also known af­­fectionately as ‘Amma Hou­­ri’ — hailed from Kohlu, a district dominated by the Marri tribe in eastern Balochistan.
After the end of the fourth Baloch insurgency, which was fought predominantly by Marri Baloch tribesmen, her family went to Afghanistan along with the other Marri tribesmen.
Upon their return, they settled in New Kahan, on the outskirts of Quetta, near the Hazarganji area.
“After his cousin, Dr Moh­a­mmad Akbar Marri, went mis­­sing in 2010, Gul Moham­mad started struggling for his safe release because (Dr Marri’s) children were too young to come out,” recalls Nasrullah Baloch.
“Instead, he himself beca­­me a missing person within two years.”
An activist who used to participate in demonstrations alongside the septuagenarian told Dawn that Bibi Houri came into the media limelight in 2023, when several Baloch families staged a long march to Islamabad.
At the time, the families of the missing — comprising mo­­stly women and children — were dealt with unsympathetically, being subjected to baton-charges and water cannons after they reached the capital.
Besides Islamabad, the eld­erly Bibi Houri attended public meetings and protests in Mastung, Quetta, and Dalba­ndin, among other places. She would stand among the cro­wd, holding her son’s photo while calling for the recovery of all missing persons.
“There are many women like Bibi Houri who search for their sons, brothers or husbands & sometimes die without ever knowing whether they are alive or dead,” journalist Munizae Jahangir wrote on X.







“Houri worried for her son Marri’s children who are growing up without a father, she said she was old but she braved the rain & the unforgiving sun for them,” she wrote in her epitaph.
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also lamented on X that there was no one to pursue Bibi Houri’s legal case following the imprisonment of her daughter, Imaan Mazari-Hazir, who had been handling it.

The “Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2026”, published on Wed­nesday by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), also reveals a picture of deeply imbalanced development in the region.
Gains in health and well-being, and poverty reduction over the past decades, are being overshadowed by severe environmental dec­line and widening inequalities. Evidence shows setbacks in ensuring equal access to education and com­pliance with labour rights.
Insufficient data on gender equality and on peace, justice and strong institutions are obscuring policymakers’ understanding of how effe­ctively the most vulnerable are being reached. In critical areas such as climate action, marine conservation and biodiversity, the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
For cities and communities, persistent regression, including damage to critical infrastructure, underscores a dangerous gap between planning and resilience on the ground.
“The very engines of gro­wth that once lifted millions out of poverty and fuelled rapid industrialisation are now undermining our future,” said UN Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisja­hbana, who is also the ESCAP executive secretary. “Our collective challe­nge is also our ­greatest opportunity: to build a region that is not only wea­lthier but smarter and healthier,” she added.

The Israeli authorities also imposed age restrictions on West Bank Palestinians, permitting entry only to men aged 55 and older, women aged 50 and older, and children up to age 12 to attend the Friday prayers.

 

“Ten thousand Palestinian worshippers will be permitted to enter the Temple Mount for Friday prayers throughout the month of Ramadan, subject to obtaining a dedicated daily permit in advance,” COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of civilian matters in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement.
“Entry for men will be permitted from age 55, for women from age 50, and for children up to age 12 when accompanied by a first-degree relative.” COGAT said, adding that restrictions apply only to Palestinians travelling from the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

Imam of Al Aqsa arrested by Israeli police; Hamas condemns arrest, restrictions on worshippers’ access to holy mosque

“It is emphasised that all permits are conditional upon prior security approval by the relevant security authorities,” COGAT said.
“In addition, residents travelling to prayers at the Temple Mount will be required to undergo digital documentation at the crossings upon their return to the areas of Judea and Samaria at the conclusion of the prayer day,” it said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
During Ramazan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al Aqsa, Islam’s third holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed in a move that is not internationally recognised.
Since the war in Gaza broke out in October 2023, the attendance of worshippers has declined due to tough Israeli restrictions.
Israel arrests Al Aqsa Mosque Imam
Israeli police on Monday arrested the Imam of Al Aqsa Mosque, Sheikh Moh­am­med al-Abbasi, from inside the mosque’s courtyards in occupied Jerusalem.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA, citing local sources, reported that Israeli forces detained Sheikh al-Abbasi inside the courtyards of Al Aqsa Mosque without giving any reason.
It said the arrest “comes amid escalating Israeli measures against the blessed Al Aqsa Mosque, including restrictions on imams, preachers and worshippers stationed there, limitations on the entry of worshippers, and intensifying incursions carried out by settlers under heavy protection from Israeli police”.
On Tuesday, Hamas condemned the arrest of al-Abbasi in a statement, saying he had been “served with an order banning him from the mosque”.
The movement said the measure “constitutes blatant interference in the affairs of Al Aqsa and an unacceptable assault on its imams”.

Ukraine has faced repeated pressure from US President Donald Tru­mp to agree to a deal that could mean painful concessions, as Russ­ian forces pound its power grid and slowly advance on the battlefield.
As the delegations met for a second day at a hotel in the Swiss city, under the mediation of US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Zelensky had called the first day “difficult”. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” he wrote on X.







No date for talks to resume
Moments after his statement, the delegations broke off the talks and said they would meet again in the future, without providing a date. Russia’s chief negotiator, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, described the talks as “difficult, but business-like”.
Medinsky — whom Ukrainian officials have accused of engaging in history lectures rather than substantive talks — spoke with the Ukrainians for nearly two hours after formal talks ended, according to a representative of Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov.
A spokesperson for Zelensky said the formal part of the talks had addressed territory in Ukraine’s east and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, both sticking points since the beginning of the process.
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the roughly 20pc of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian forces have been unable to conquer — something Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. Kyiv, meanwhile, wants Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to be operated by the US and Ukraine, which Russia has said is unacceptable.
Pressure from Trump
Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, which has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, and ravaged Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians.
Trump has twice suggested in recent days that it is up to Kyiv to make sure a deal is agreed quickly. He had told reporters on Monday: “Ukraine better come to the table fast. That’s all I’m telling you.” In an interview with the US news outlet Axios, Zelensky was quoted as saying that it was “not fair” that Tr­u­mp kept publicly demanding con­­c­essions from Ukraine, not Russia.
Zelensky also said any plan requiring Ukraine to give up territory that Russia had not captured in the east would be rejected if put to a referendum. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.
The Geneva meeting follows two rounds of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi that made no breakthrough. Both Zelensky and Umerov have made a point of repeatedly thanking the US for its mediation in recent weeks.
Zelensky has expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections in November could draw Washington’s attention away from efforts to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two.
Kyiv is also seeking strong US-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks in the event of a peace deal. US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Brigadier General Michael Adamski took part in three-way military negotiations on Wednesday, according to a US official.

Addressing a crowded press conference at the Central Press Club, leaders of the opposition alliance — comprising the PML-N, the PTI and its dissidents — alleged that the government was evading constitutional accountability within the assembly.
PML-N regional president and Leader of the Opposition Shah Ghulam Qadir said a requisitioned session of the House, convened by the opposition, was abruptly adjourned despite quorum and agenda items.
“We ensured quorum. With business on the agenda, the sudden adjournment was incomprehensible,” he said, adding that at one stage only one minister was present to respond to questions.

Vows to resist ‘any attempt’ to derail polls

The session was prorogued before calling attention notices and resolutions could be taken up, prompting the opposition to pass what he described as an unprecedented resolution of condemnation against the government.
Mr Qadir claimed the PPP no longer commanded a majority in the House and accused it of making hasty appointments and distributing discretionary posts arbitrarily. Political advisers, he alleged, were being posted in the Kashmir Liberation Cell instead of subject experts.
Warning the government against what he termed complacency, he said: “If the PPP does not mend its ways, it will not take long to move a no-confidence motion. If they are under any illusion, they should disabuse themselves of it.”
However, he added that with elections approaching, the opposition did not wish to destabilise the system and would act within constitutional bounds. “The government will act, and we will react,” he said, making it clear that the opposition would not allow the assembly’s term to be extended “even by a single day”.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s restoration of the Third Party Act, he alleged that appointments were still being made without due process, including tests and interviews.
Former prime minister Raja Farooq Haider ter­med the present arrangement a deviation from what was initially agreed as a temporary set-up. He alleged that budgetary changes were being made without assembly appr­oval and warned that the prime minister was “walking a tightrope”.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) demanded a higher fuel cost on account of power consumed in January, even though almost 60 per cent of the power was generated from domestic, cheaper sources. Electricity consumption was reported to be around 12pc higher than the same month last year and 8pc higher than December 2025.
Once approved, the power companies would charge an additional amount of about Rs16bn to consumers of all the power companies, including ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) and K-Electric, in the billing month of March. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has called a public hearing on February 26 to examine the request for fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The CPPA, which filed the petition for a higher FCA for January consumption, said the power consumption was around 12.1pc higher than the same month of the previous year and about 8pc higher than the previous month, December 2025. The power companies have claimed an average fuel cost of Rs12.18 per unit for January 2026, compared to Rs11.03 per unit of the same month of the previous year and almost Rs2.56 per unit higher than Rs9.62 per unit in December 2025.

CPPA demands higher fuel charges citing 12pc increase in demand

The CPPA reported that 8,762 billion units (gigawatt hours) of electricity were delivered to Discos in January.
The power companies have claimed that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs12.18 per unit in January, against a pre-approved reference fuel cost of Rs10.395 per unit. There is a need for an additional FCA of about Rs1.78 per unit.
The CPPA said about 9,140GWh of electricity was generated in January at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs106.4bn (Rs11.64 per unit), of which 8,762GWh of energy was delivered to Discos for Rs106.7bn (Rs12.18 per unit), leading to a higher fuel cost over what was already charged to consumers in December bills. Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG)- based power generation accounted for the largest share of the grid’s fuel, with almost 22pc.
This was followed by nuclear power with its 17.5pc share. Traditional hydropower generation dipped to just 8pc in the wake of the annual canal closure for maintenance. Third position was secured by imported coal, with a 17.28pc share, followed by local coal with a 15.4pc share.
The share of local gas-based generation stood at 12pc in January, up from 11pc in December. Furnace oil-based generation revived to 3pc, although the fuel has been officially phased out.
Furnace oil-based generation was the most expensive at Rs33.55 per unit, followed by Rs20 per unit from RLNG, Rs13.5 per unit from imported coal, Rs12.74 per unit from local gas, and Rs11.63 per unit from local coal. There was no power generation from high-speed diesel.
The nuclear fuel cost amounted to Rs2.23 per unit in January. The three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed a 4.55pc share to the grid. Wind and solar have no fuel costs, while bagasse-based plants had a fuel cost of Rs10.39 per unit, with just 1.11pc contribution to the grid. Electricity imports from Iran accounted for 0.38pc of the total, with a fuel cost of Rs22.06 per unit.

Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge bench that had taken up a number of cases moved by the PTI founder.
National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar and others were present inside Courtroom No. 2.
During the hearing, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar wondered why the petitioner had not challenged the ECP notification, which had disqualified him. Justice Kakar observed that it would be better to summon the ECP to explain the disqualification.

Apex court adjourns proceedings in cipher, defamation cases against PTI chief

Sardar Latif Khosa argued that in the concealment of assets case, the sentence awarded to the petitioner was suspended, but not the judgement. Justice Kakar reminded the counsel that he had only requested the Islamabad High Court to suspend the sentence and the high court had granted him the relief.
Mr Khosa contended that he wanted to cite 2019 Nasir Mehmood case in which the SC had held that suspension of sentence would have the same consequence as the suspension of the judgement.
Prosecutor General Islamabad Sarwar Nahang, however, said that the suspension of the sentence and suspension of the conviction were two different things.
Despite reluctance by Mr Khosa, the court asked the counsel to read the particular paragraph from the 2019 judgement, wherein it was held by the SC that unless the conviction was specifically suspended or the appeal was ultimately allowed and conviction as well as sentence were set aside, the conviction of the appellant would continue to hold the field and the disqualification would remain intact.
Justice Kakar observed that the counsel, by invoking a citation against his case, had blocked the way the court was considering to provide relief. “It seems your eyesight has become weak,” Justice Kakar quipped. He added that another way was to listen to the ECP’s point of view to know why the petitioner was disqualified.
The SC then postponed the proceedings for an indefinite period.
The same bench adjourned further proceedings in the cipher case against PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qur­e­shi when Special Prosecutor Zulf­ikar Naqvi sought time to furnish a detailed judgement in the case.
Moreover, referring to a set of appeals against the interim orders in the defamation case, which was mov­ed by PM Shehbaz Sharif aga­i­nst Mr Khan, the court adjourned the proceedings until after Ramazan.

WASHINGTON: Pakistan joined the international community in asking Israel to immediately halt the expansion of its unlawful presence in the occupied West Bank, hours before Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Washington to attend a US-sponsored international summit on Gaza today (Thursday).
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar made the call while delivering Pakistan’s national statement at a high-level United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Pakistan told the UNSC there can be “no durable peace without justice” in the region, reaffirming unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and announcing its participation in a new diplomatic initiative aimed at advancing a two-state solution.
“There can be no durable peace without justice, no stability without accountability, and no sustainable solution without the realization of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” the deputy premier said in his address.
Just a day earlier, the Palestinian mission to the United Nations issued a joint statement by 85 nations, calling for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank.
Also, the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Arab League and the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank. The foreign ministers reiterated their categorical rejection of all unilateral measures aimed at altering the legal, demographic, and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territory.
Ready to back peace initiatives
Highlighting Pakistan’s participation in the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” (BoP) in Washington on Feb 19, Deputy PM Dar said Pakistan was doing so with the objective of reinforcing ongoing diplomatic efforts for the resolution of the Palestinian issue.
“We engage in this process with the firm conviction that sustained diplomacy, anch­or­ed in international law and the UN Charter and guided by accountability, provides the only viable pathway to a just and lasting peace,” he said.
Reaffirming Islamabad’s political and moral position, the deputy prime minister said: “Pakistan’s solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters and their just cause remains unwavering. We stand with them in their legitimate pursuit of right to self-determination, dignity and freedom.”
He underscored Pakistan’s readiness to support multiple peace initiatives, noting: “Pakistan is ready and willing to contribute to all diplomatic initiatives, including President Trump’s Peace Plan, the BoP, the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Global Alliance for the Two-State Solution, which must reinforce one another through coordinated and concrete implementation, in the interest of our shared objective of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.”
Outcome of BoP meeting
Meanwhile, international observers say it remains unclear whether the BoP’s first meeting will “deliver reconstruction, legitimacy or simply controversy”.
US President Donald Trump will host the Board of Peace meeting in Washington today (Thursday), where he is expected to announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza, the White House said, adding that more than 20 countries will attend board of peace meeting.
The Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), an independent non-profit think tank established in Milan in 1934, noted that member states are expected to announce a collective $5bn commitment for Gaza’s reconstruction, against overall requirements of about $70bn, according to UN estimates.
ISPI said the BOP also plans to deploy thousands of personnel for international stabilisation and policing forces in Gaza and that the meeting is expected to clarify which countries will participate.
According to the think tank, key regional states — Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Turkiye, Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait — have confirmed their participation, along with Israel, which is sending its foreign minister to the summit-level meeting.
Indonesia has become the first country to signal readiness to contribute to the force, pledging to deploy 8,000 troops by June.

Speaking at a joint press conference following a seminar on ‘Rest­oring Peace in Balochistan and Confidence-Building, the Institutional Respo­nsibilities of Ulema and Mashaykh’, the scholars — including Maulana Dr Ata ur Rehman, Allama Muh­ammad Juma Asadi, Mau­lana Anwar-ul-Haq Haq­qani, and Qari Abdul Reh­man Noorzai — emphasised that lasting solutions lie in justice, mediation, and reconciliation rather than the use of force. 
The clerics urged the government to conduct transparent investigations into all missing persons’ cases. They said that anyone found guilty should be tried in open courts, while innocent individuals must be released immediately. 
Warning that the province now stands at a crossroads, the scholars noted one path leads toward com­­plete separation and the other toward a constituti­o­nal struggle for basic righ­­ts. They traced the current cycle of violence, the consequences of which are still being felt today, to the 2006 killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former federal minister, Balochistan chief minister and governor. 
The scholars warned that hostile elements exp­loit local grievances and demanded that citizens be treated as partners of the state rather than suspects. 
To reduce frustration and anxiety among the youth, they demanded that locals be given jobs and a meaningful stake in Gwadar, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and mining projects.  
They also called for a major portion of revenue generated from provincial resources to be allocated to local development. 
The clerics blamed foreign interference for worsening the situation, alleging that external forces sought to create divisions, hatred and mistrust to prevent unity among Muslim countries and destabilise Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. 
Noting that the Quran declares peacemaking between disputing parties a religious duty, the scholars said the seminar proposed several specific measures to restore stability.  
These include holding transparent elections in the province; granting locals their rightful share in natural resources; expanding education, specifically technical and vocational training and employment opportunities; regulating border trade routes and eliminating drug and trawler mafias; empowering the Human Rights Commission; establishing a reconciliation council comprising ulema and respected community figures. 
They further called for improved intelligence systems with community participation and introduced the idea of special quotas for Balochistan in public and private sectors. 
The scholars reaffirmed that Balochistan’s leading ulema and mashaykh stand ready to shoulder any responsibility assigned to them for restoring peace and stability in the province.

The minister made the remarks in an interview with France 24. The comments come as the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, led by US President Donald Trump, will be held in Washington on February 19. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will be attending the meeting.



In the interview, Asif was asked about Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace and if the country would contribute troops for a military force in Gaza.
“I don’t see any problem in that. It all depends on what sort of terms of reference are drafted for that peace force,” he said, highlighting that Pakistan was a part of UN peacekeeping missions.
“So we have that experience. Palestine is a cause that is very close to our hearts. We have been demonstrating solidarity with them for many, many, many decades,” he said.
He said that Pakistan had supported the cause of Palestine on countless international forums.
“So this is something worth attempting. This is a good opportunity. Let’s hope it brings us closer to the two-state solution in the Middle East,” he said.
The interviewer then pointed out that many Muslim countries had normalised ties with Israel and asked whether this was on the table for Pakistan.
“No, not yet. You know, I do not see this option even being considered by Pakistan. Maybe, in the future, when there is a total paradigm shift and two states are established and Palestinians have the right of self-determination, their own homeland,” he said.
“At the moment, it is not on the cards at all,” he said.
‘India waging proxy war’
The minister was then asked about the security situation in the country, including the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad.
In response, Asif said that there were almost “all franchises of terrorism” in neighbouring Afghanistan, which he attributed to the “non-seriousness” of the Afghan Taliban government. He said that the Afghan Taliban was providing terrorists safe haven on their soil.
“Nothing can happen from across the border from Afghanistan … any attack in Pakistan, it has the blessings of the Afghan government,” he said.
Asked about Pakistan’s strikes in Afghanistan, the minister said, “We always have that option and we can exercise that option. We won’t hesitate.”
He further said that if terrorist outfits were operating from Afghan soil, the responsibility lay with Kabul’s rulers.
Asked about India, the minister highlighted the military conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025.
“Our air force practically decimated whatever attempt they were making to invade Pakistan. So now they are waging a proxy war against Pakistan,” he said.
“Delhi and Kabul and all these terrorist outfits are on the same page,” he said.
He said that friendly countries had attempted to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul but “these attempts did not produce any results”.
He said that the Afghan Taliban had accepted that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was operating from their territory.
“They indirectly said that they had no control over them. We told them that allow us to deal with them … they accepted their responsibility verbally, but whatever we agreed upon … they are not ready to give it in writing,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18212100008c53e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974187/our-goal-win-t20-world-cup-says-shadab-as-pakistan-into-super-eights' target='_blank'><strong>Our goal? Win T20 World Cup, says Shadab as Pakistan into Super Eights</strong></a><br><p>Shadab Khan said Pakistan believed they could go on and win the T20 World Cup after their best performance of the tournament secured the last Super Eights berth on Wednesday.
Pakistan bowled out Namibia for 97 to win by a colossal 102 runs in Colombo and bounce back in style after a defeat to arch-rivals India had left them in danger of elimination.
Pakistan rode on an undefeated maiden T20 international century by opener Sahibzada Farhan to post 199-3.

 

Spinners Usman Tariq and Shadab Khan then shared seven wickets to rout Namibia in 17.3 overs.
“We didn’t take this game lightly after so much talk about one match against India,” said Shadab, who scored a brisk 22-ball 36 and grabbed 3-19.
“We are on the right track to achieve the goal of winning the World Cup and we are following a process,” he added.
Shadab warned that the Super Eights, which Pakistan will begin with a match against New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday before facing England and co-hosts Sri Lanka next week, will be a step up.
“There are eight good teams so it will be a tough stage and all matches will be high-pressure games,” said Shadab.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha was beaming when he described the win as a “complete performance”.
“We started really well and in the middle, we put partnerships on and then finished well,” he said.
“Sahibzada has been outstanding, the way he’s been batting for us for the last six months. He scored a hundred today and I’m very happy for him,” he said.
“When it comes to bowling, we were lethal and we were ruthless. We bowled in the right areas.”
Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus admitted there were lessons to be learned as they head home after losing all four of their group matches.
“I think for us, it’s always about nailing those specialist positions,” said Erasmus.
“It has been a great learning experience and will help us in future.”
Erasmus said Namibia were now looking forward to the ODI World Cup next year, which they will co-host with South Africa and Zimbabwe.
“There is a lot of cricket around and lots of really exciting things happening in and around cricket in Namibia, which gives the boys a lot of pleasing things to play for,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16080817ae09ebd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973619/the-employment-of-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>The employment of tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>JOB creation and the ‘future of work’ are now the renewed focus of multilateral organisations trying to make growth inclusive and resilient, and to combat domestic instability fuelled by joblessness.
World Bank President Ajay Banga says, “We’re trying to move the bank group as a whole from the idea of projects to the idea of outcomes.” He told Reuters that employment creation will remain “a binding constraint on growth over the long-term”, as such, “Job creation is the North Star”.
With the productive economy suffocated, Pakistan is heading towards a severe employment crisis, leaving millions of young people without visible job opportunities, says Chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Businessmen’s Panel Mian Anjum Nisar; the country is losing its most valuable assets — its workforce.
Jobs are created when factories run on full capacity with value-addition, without which job creation will be limited and vulnerable to external shocks, he explained, listing the various factors eroding the country’s economic competitiveness.

‘The future of work does not simply happen; it is shaped by choices governments, employers and workers make together’

Explaining that the government is fully aware of the economic challenges, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged that, “There are firms which are leaving the country that is true. If the taxation is high or the energy cost is high or its financing cost is always moving in the right direction, those have been real issues,” he said while addressing the Pakistan Policy Dialogue in Islamabad.
However, Mr Aurangzeb stated that “it takes two to tango” and firms still relying must reconsider their practises as old, state-dependent business models are simply “not going to work in the New World Order”.
Some of the multinational firms switched to local sourcing which has helped their margins, “They are now able to export, therefore they stay, and if another firm has not been able to do that, then that’s something we know they need to think through.”
Local firms have invested in Pakistan International Airline’s privatisation, and 20 new foreign investors, including Google, Aramco, Wafi Energy, Turkish Petroleum, and others had entered the Pakistani market in the last 18 months, he highlighted.
Yet, Pakistan still needs to generate 2.5–3 million jobs a year — roughly 25–30m over the next decade — as millions of young people come of age, Mr Banga said, adding that failure to do so could fuel illegal migration or domestic instability.
However, “Equally troubling is the interaction between weak employment growth and declining real incomes,” says a Dawn editorial, further writing, “Cumulative inflation in recent years has outpaced income gains, resulting in a fall in real per capita household income and a rise in poverty risks. At the same time, inequality trends suggest that whatever limited growth has occurred has been unevenly distributed.”

 

To take care of this issue on the global scale, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has redefined the “future of work”.
Calling for a shift in labour standard, ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo emphasised: “Modern labour governance must move beyond job-centred approaches towards worker-centred systems, where rights, social protection, skills development and workers’ voices accompany people across increasingly diverse and mobile careers, including in platform and digitally managed work.”
“The future of work does not simply happen. It is shaped by the choices governments, employers and workers make together.”
Speaking at the Summit’s Future of Work Forum in a session Mr Houngbo said, “Strong labour governance is not a barrier to growth; it is what makes growth inclusive and resilient.”
On Feb 9, Moody’s forecast Pakistan’s real GDP growth of around 3.5pc for 2026, up from 3.1pc in 2025, and said easing policy rates and lower inflation should support credit demand. It added that margins are expected to remain steady after declining following rate cuts.
The agency revised Pakistan’s banking sector outlook to stable from positive, citing that the operating environment is recovering “but only gradually” as the economic and fiscal outlook improves and the external position strengthens.
The move signals that volatility has eased without a strong growth push behind it, says Komal Kenneth Shakeel, Head of Partnerships and Collaborations at Ignite.
A biannual State Bank Monetary Policy report projected real GDP growth in the range of 3.75–4.75pc for FY26.The report also underscored evolving risks to the improved macroeconomic outlook —sources of vulnerability involve inflation, external account and GDP growth. It is important to speed up the progress on structural reforms to increase the economy’s resilience to adverse shocks, and to improve productivity and plug losses of state-owned enterprises, the report added.
Moreover, the utilisation of annual Public Sector Development Programme funds has inched up to 27pc in first seven months of FY2025 — well behind the approved disbursement schedule, but relatively higher than the 20pc recorded for the same period of the last fiscal year.
Under the mechanism announced by the Ministry of Finance for FY26, the PSDP spending should have crossed at least Rs443bn (43pc) of the allocation by Jan 31.
