Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema made the appeal in a joint handwritten open letter, which was shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday.
They also drew a comparison between the events surrounding the jailed ex-prime minister’s treatment today and that of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif in 2019.
Nawaz, who was serving a prison sentence granted by an accountability court that found him guilty of corruption in the Al Azizia case in 2019, had been allowed to travel to London for treatment after he was diagnosed with an immune system disorder. Prior to that, he was also provided treatment at the hospital in Pakistan.
The five PTI leaders said in their letter that in 2019, “when Nawaz Sharif was shifted to Services Hospital, Lahore for low platelet count, we as the sitting government ensured that he should get proper treatment for his ailment”.
“His personal physician Dr Adnan was part of all meetings conducted by the medical board. We even personally asked Mian Nawaz Sharif whether he was satisfied with his treatment,” the leaders said.
They added that Nawaz was also asked whether he wanted to be treated by a physician of his choice and assured that the relevant doctor would be called.
“His family and legal counsel had free access to him,” the letter further stated. “We are sure that if you ask Mian Nawaz Sharif personally, he will not refute our claims,” it added.
The leaders recalled that Nawaz was also permitted to go to England for treatment.
Comparing those events with the situation today, the five leaders said that Imran, a former premier, has “faced obstructions of all forms in his treatment”.
They accused the incumbent government of carrying out a “cloak and dagger activity”, saying: “First, the present government did not accept that he was unwell and then when the news was leaked from Pims about his central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), the government blustered around with all sorts of obnoxious statements. His consultants’ rights were trampled […] and his family was not granted access [to him]; his lawyer and personal physicians could not meet him.”
The jailed leaders said that Imran was taken to the hospital for the administration of a second injection on Tuesday, “but his family was not informed.“
Only PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan “received a message at 2am that he had been given his second injection”.
“The government should be ashamed of itself. This callous attitude will never improve the situation. We, however, think this Form-47 government does not want any political stability as they know that they never won the [2024] elections, and they do not want to lose their chairs (positions) as they have no chance of winning again,” the leaders maintained.
The health condition of Imran, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
The concerns have been heightened with restrictions in place on meetings with Imran at the jail.
However, earlier this month, a two-member Supreme Court bench led by CJP Afridi had allowed Imran’s lawyer Salman Safdar to meet him, declaring him amicus curiae.
After the meeting, Safdar had submitted a report to the SC, which said “only 15 per cent” vision was left in Imran’s right eye.
Government, however, has been issuing statements to allay these concerns, with the law minister stating at one instance that “if he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6”.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Today, the PTI approached the Supreme Court seeking the medical treatment of jailed party founder at a hospital of his choice, along with access to his personal physicians.</p><small>2026-02-25 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251945120d81588.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975694/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-pti-founder-imran-from-his-2nd-visit-to-pims' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show PTI founder Imran from his 2nd visit to Pims</strong></a><br><p>Multiple PTI supporters across social media platforms were sharing a dim clip of party founder Imran Khan since February 24, 2026, claiming that it was from his latest visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for a second eye injection. However, the video is old from February 20, 2023, when he appeared before the Lahore High Court (LHC) for interim protective bail in a case. The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false.
Imran was brought to Pims for a follow-up eye treatment on Feb 24. According to a doctor, he was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection.
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January 2026. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later.
Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations.
On Feb 24, a user, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on his profile picture and past posts on X, shared a dim video of Imran with the following caption: “Imran Khan’s video of his arrival at Pims hospital has gone viral”.
The post gained 180,000 views.
An Indian propaganda account also shared the same video with a similar claim on X with the following caption: “Pakistani hospital: A video of Imran Khan has gone viral.”
The post accumulated 190,000 views.
The same video was also shared by another PTI supporter on X with a similar caption, garnering more than 60,000 views.
Another user shared a screenshot from the same video with a similar claim, gaining more than 105,000 views.
Another PTI supporter shared the same video and a screenshot of the video with a similar caption. Subsequently, he reshared his own video and screenshot again, gaining a total of 63,000 views.
The same video with a similar claim was shared by multiple other PTI supporters on Instagram; TikTok, as can be seen here, here, and here; Facebook, as seen here, here, here, here, here, here and here; and X, as seen here, here, here, here, here, here and here. They collectively gained over 270,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the health of the former prime minister and PTI founder.
A reverse image search was conducted on a keyframe to trace the source of the clip, which yielded a YouTube video shared by Indian media outlet The Tribune on February 20, 2023.
The video was titled: “Former Pak PM Imran Khan appears before court amid high drama, gets protective bail in one case”.



The video shows the moment when Imran reached the LHC to seek protective bail in a case pertaining to an ‘attack’ on the Election Commission of Pakistan building.



As can be seen in the original video referenced above, the visuals in the viral clip are identical.
Imran and the individuals standing behind him are wearing the same clothes, and a person in the background can be seen wearing the same distinctive cap, confirming that the footage is from the earlier video and not from a recent visit.
The same appearance with similar visuals was covered by multiple domestic mainstream media outlets such as Dawn, The Nation, Dunya News, Express Tribune and The News International.
Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that a viral video shows PTI founder Imran  from his most recent visit to Pims for a second eye injection is false.​ The clip is old and shows Imran appearing before the LHC for interim protective bail on February 2023.

The FO said in a statement on Wednesday that the ministerial session would be held on February 26 in Jeddah “to consider the illegal decisions of the Israeli occupation authorities aimed at expanding settlements, pursuing annexation, and attempting to impose Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank”.







The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
The move is in violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
At the ministerial session in Jeddah, FM Dar would share Pakistan’s perspective on the “latest illegal measures by Israel to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called ‘state land’“, the FO said.
He would also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the FO statement said, adding that he would also “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities”.
Earlier, several Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
“We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” a joint statement by the countries said.
The Palestinian Presidency has also slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, according to Wafa news agency.
Palestinian group Hamas has also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.</p><small>2026-02-25 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/252058310ec2924.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975699/committee-to-protect-journalists-rights-groups-express-concern-at-deterioration-of-media-freedom-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Committee to Protect Journalists, rights groups express concern at ‘deterioration of media freedom’ in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and 17 other press freedom and human rights organisations on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take immediate steps to “uphold the country’s constitutional and international obligations” to protect press freedom.
In a joint letter addressed to the premier, they said they were writing to express “deep concern regarding the sustained deterioration of media freedom in Pakistan”.
The letter was endorsed by Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Press Institute, Forum Asia, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and the Freedom Network, among other local and international groups.
The letter said that the recent legal and institutional developments, alongside “persistent failures” to ensure accountability for attacks on journalists, had contributed to a worsening environment for members of the media in Pakistan.







“We urge your government to take immediate action to uphold Pakistan’s obligations under the Constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantee freedom of expression and the press, and require the State to protect journalists from violence, intimidation, and unlawful interference,” the letter said.
In an analysis, the letter said Pakistan’s press freedom situation, which was “already challenging”, had deteriorated further since the adoption of the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November 2025.
The letter noted that the amendment led to the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), adding that the development coincided with “a weakening of judicial oversight and accountability in cases involving attacks on the media”.
Rather than strengthening protections for journalists, the letter said, “These changes have contributed to a more restrictive and uncertain environment for independent journalism.”
It further said that judicial inaction in high-profile murder cases had reinforced a pattern of impunity that continued to endanger the press.
The letter went on to say that after the amendment, journalists across Pakistan had faced increased “legal harassment, intimidation, surveillance, regulatory scrutiny, and threats — all of which had had a chilling effect on press freedom”.
At the same time, it said the persistent failure of authorities to ensure accountability for crimes against journalists had reinforced a pattern of impunity that continued to place media workers at “serious risk”.
While raising concerns about journalist Sohrab Barkat’s detention under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), the letter demanded his “immediate and unconditional” release.
It urged the government to ensure that laws were not used to criminalise journalism, and to guarantee that media organisations could operate without intimidation or administrative pressure.
The letter also pointed out the FCC’s decision to dispose of suo motu proceedings in the case related to Journalist Arshad Sharif, who was shot dead in Kenya in 2022.
“Despite the seriousness of the case and its global significance for journalist safety, justice remains incomplete,” it said. It demanded that the government reopen a transparent investigation into his death via an independent judicial commission.
The letter also called on the authorities to investigate threats and halt intimidation against journalist Nadir Abbas Baloch.
“Ensuring accountability in cases of intimidation is essential to prevent an escalation in harmful behaviour towards journalists nationwide,” it said.
The letter raised the alarm over the “expansion of restrictions on press freedom beyond national borders”.
It pressed upon the government to “halt judicial action against foreign-based journalists for their reporting or commentary, review relevant laws to ensure alignment with international standards on freedom of expression, and reaffirm that journalism and criticism of public institutions are protected”.
Moreover, the letter demanded the government urgently “repeal or substantially” amend Peca, including the 2025 amendments.
“Peca’s vague provisions enable arbitrary first information reports, arrests, and prosecutions of journalists, independent media, and digital platforms for legitimate reporting on state institutions, creating a chilling effect on free expression,” it said.
“These abuses violate international freedom of expression standards and must be reformed to safeguard journalists’ constitutional rights and the public’s right to information,” it said.
The letter also sought protection for Afghan journalists living in exile in Pakistan amid a “recent surge in the detentions and deportations”.
“Deportation could expose them to serious retaliation, arbitrary detention, violence, or death. We urge the government to immediately halt deportations of journalists and media workers at risk and uphold the principle of non-refoulement for individuals facing credible threats due to their journalistic work,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-25 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2520190782b72fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975698/lahore-court-issues-notice-to-nccia-on-bail-petition-filed-by-canadian-national-in-cybercrime-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore court issues notice to NCCIA on bail petition filed by Canadian national in cybercrime case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A judicial magistrate at a district court on Wednesday issued a notice to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) while hearing a bail petition of a Canadian national who was arrested in a cybercrime case.
Hamza Ahmed Khan, who was pursuing doctoral research, had reportedly gone missing last week, leading to the registration of a first information report. He turned up in NCCIA’s custody on Monday and was sent to jail on judicial remand. Subsequently, he filed for post-arrest bail.
On Wednesday, Advocate Asad Jamal appeared before the magistrate on behalf of Khan. During the hearing, the magistrate directed the NCCIA’s investigating officer to submit a record of the case on Thursday.
In his petition, the applicant alleged that he was abducted on the night between Feb 18 and 19, while travelling in a cab in Lahore.
The petitioner claimed that the first information report (FIR) against him by the FIA’s cyber crime wing was registered a day later on Feb 21, with “malafide intentions” to conceal the alleged abduction incident.
The bail petition contended that the sequence of events raised doubts about the legality and transparency of the investigation against the petitioner.
It argued that there was no direct or corroborative evidence linking the petitioner to the alleged offence.
The NCCIA registered the case against Khan under sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26A (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca).
According to the FIR, during the course of inquiry, it was verified that Khan was uploading “derogatory posts against the state functionaries and state institutions with the intention to harm the reputation of the state functionaries”.
It further said that the suspect was posting derogatory content to “defame and malign the constitutional and political leadership of Pakistan, incite hatred and undermine the integrity of the state.”</p><small>2026-02-25 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25201347aa341dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975697/4-cops-martyred-2-injured-in-firing-by-unidentified-assailants-on-patrol-squad-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>4 cops martyred, 2 injured in firing by unidentified assailants on patrol squad in KP’s Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>BAJAUR: Four cops were martyred and two others were wounded when unidentified attackers opened fire at a patrol party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Wednesday evening.
Khar Police Station House Officer Gul Zada told Dawn that the attackers targeted the Ababeel Squad — an exclusive patrolling force — at the time of Iftar near the Nawai Kallay area.
The squad was on a routine patrol when unidentified attackers opened fire on them, he said, adding that four policemen died on the spot while two others were “seriously injured”.
Separately, Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Khan told Dawn that the personnel were on their way to the Bajaur police lines from Inayat Kallay bazaar, with their duty hours about to end, when they were attacked.
As a result, four cops — Yar Zada, Dawood Khan, Imran Khan and Siraj Khan — were martyred while Irshad Khan and Azizur Rehman were injured, he added.
SHO Gul Zada said the injured policemen were immediately taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar for treatment.
Meanwhile, a police team led by senior officials immediately rushed to the site of the incident and launched a search operation to hunt down the attackers, who had fled after the shooting, Israr Khan said.
The attack in Bajaur took place a day after seven police personnel were martyred in two attacks in KP, where law enforcers have increasingly come under attack in recent days.
On Tuesday, six law enforcement personnel, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Asad Mehmood, were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Kohat district.
A police officer told Dawn that the DSP, an inspector and four constables were martyred when their vehicle was ambushed near Shakardara Road while transporting two individuals for a court appearance. One of the two individuals being transported was also killed in the attack. The assailants later set the vehicle on fire.
In a separate incident, a constable was martyred after unidentified men opened fire in the Mughal Khel village of Wana tehsil in Lower South Waziristan.
On Monday, three Federal Constabulary men were martyred when terrorists attacked rescue teams in the Karak district. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur district resulted in the martyrdom of 11 security personnel.</p><small>2026-02-25 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/252012247d4a986.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975688/centre-provinces-agree-on-joint-strategy-to-establish-peace-and-stability-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, provinces agree on joint strategy to establish peace and stability in country</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The federal and provincial governments on Wednesday agreed on a joint strategy to establish peace and stability in the country.
An agreement to this effect was reached during an important meeting on law and order held with Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry in the chair.
The development comes amid the surge of terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, carried out by Fitna Al Khawarij and Fitna Al Hindustan — state-designated names for terror outfits backed by Indian proxies.
During the meeting, the Centre assured provincial governments of the provision of necessary resources and technical support to maintain law and order.
“Protection of citizens’ lives and property is the state’s top priority,” Chaudhry remarked. He also praised the security forces’ role in the fight against terrorism.
“The security forces remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” he said.
The meeting was attended by the federal interior secretary, the provincial inspector generals (IG) of police, the provincial home secretaries, and the Islamabad chief commissioner and police chief.
Talking to Dawn after the meeting, Chaudhry said the meeting also assessed the threat level following strikes by Pakistan in neighbouring Afghanistan.
He said the camps and hideouts that were targeted belonged to armed groups behind the spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad.
He said the key characters behind recent terrorist incidents had been trained inside Afghanistan. He said these attacks had also been planned in the neighbouring country.
He said Pakistan had conclusive evidence to prove that the recent attacks on its soil were carried out by terrorists and suicide bombers acting at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers.
He said Islamabad had repeatedly urged Kabul to take verifiable steps to prevent armed groups from using Afghan soil, but that no substantive action had followed.
He advised Kabul to implement the Doha agreement, which bars the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities, in letter and spirit instead of playing in the hands of another one of Pakistan’s hostile neighbours.
He said the path of peace with Pakistan was in the best interest of Afghanistan, and an essential prerequisite was bringing to an end the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan.
Chaudhry said while Pakistan desired peaceful relations with all its neighbours, the security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority, which would not be compromised.
The minister said 2025 was the worst in terms of terror incidents in Pakistan and regretted that they continued to take place. He, however, said “enough was enough” and now all possible steps would be taken to stamp out terrorism through coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments.
He said the institutional mechanism involving threat alert generation, threat assessment, and the response to deal with them was working well and had helped prevent major terror incidents across the country.</p><small>2026-02-25 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25195254ad271a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975693/brain-computer-interface-technology-sees-broader-application-benefiting-patients' target='_blank'><strong>Brain-computer interface technology sees broader application, benefiting patients</strong></a><br><p>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is rapidly transitioning from laboratories to real-world applications, enabling patients to control computers, robotic arms, and robot dogs with their thoughts.
As integration into daily life accelerates, China marked a significant milestone on January 1, 2026, when its first national standard for BCI-based medical devices took effect.
The new standard defines the scope of BCI medical devices, categorises technical approaches, standardises terminology for signals such as electroencephalograms, and provides key definitions for signal acquisition, processing, encoding and decoding, as well as clinical applications.
Why are such standards important? According to Yuan Peng, deputy director-general of the department of medical device registration at the National Medical Products Administration, as China makes breakthroughs in brain science and neural decoding, BCI medical devices are entering a critical stage of industrialisation and clinical translation.
Because these devices integrate neuroscience, clinical medicine and computer science, the same concepts may be described differently across disciplines.
Inconsistent terminology and unclear definitions have hindered industrial development, he added, noting that unified standards will help establish a common technical language for this emerging field.

BCI medical devices help patients regain physical functions and may, in the future, be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease.
The technology holds significant potential and is expected to bring transformative changes to health care.
At the clinical and translational ward for BCI at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, affiliated to the Capital Medical University, a volunteer surnamed Liao wore a wireless BCI cap during a rehabilitation session.
As he slowly raised his left arm in front of a computer, the cap transmitted electrical signals from his cerebral cortex in real time to an external decoding device, assisting his rehabilitation training.
Three years ago, Liao suffered a cerebral haemorrhage that left him partially paralysed on his left side. After more than a year of conventional rehabilitation with limited improvement, he underwent surgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital in May 2025.
Doctors implanted a semi-transparent, 4-by-4-centimetre thin-film electrode beneath his skull. Following a period of rehabilitation training, his mobility function on the left side of his body improved significantly.
“During post-operative training, when the patient moves his limbs, the system captures brain signals, decodes them through algorithms, and drives external devices to assist in rehabilitation exercises,” said Cao Yong, executive deputy director of the hospital’s neurosurgery centre.
Beijing Tiantan Hospital has since launched a BCI evaluation clinic to assess whether patients are suitable candidates for semi-invasive BCI surgery. More than 3,000 patients have made appointments.
Cao noted that the technology remains in the clinical trial stage and that participant selection is conducted with caution. He expressed the hope that BCI technology will continue to advance and benefit more people in need.
Beyond rehabilitation, BCI technology is restoring independence to those with severe mobility impairments. In June 2025, a collaborative team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fudan University’s Huashan Hospital, and industry partners implanted a BCI device in a quadriplegic patient, enabling thought-controlled computer gameplay.
Six months later, a patient with high-level spinal cord injury used BCI to remotely manage an unmanned retail cabinet via video link.
According to Zhao, after two to three weeks of training following implantation, patients were able to control computer cursors and tablet devices. However, he noted that many patients hope to move beyond virtual interactions and regain a more direct connection with the physical world.
To meet this demand, the research team has extended BCI applications from screen-based control to physical external devices. Through a series of technical advances, patients with implanted BCI systems are now able to use their thoughts to operate electric wheelchairs or command robot dogs to retrieve delivered items.
“It’s like controlling a character in a video game,” one patient said. “You don’t consciously think about moving a joystick in a certain direction. You simply think about where you want to go, and the movement follows naturally.”
Zhao explained that the team adopts general-purpose interfaces and widely available devices, such as household robotic arms and robot dogs, with the aim of making BCI systems as user-friendly as Bluetooth or a computer mouse. This allows patients to control multiple external devices through a single, unified hub.
He noted that the value of BCI technology depends not only on advances in neural interfaces but also on the development of external intelligent devices.
The growing maturity and accessibility of electric wheelchairs, robot dogs and humanoid robots are providing practical outlets for thought-based control, helping translate technological progress into tangible improvements in patients’ quality of life.

In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that over the last few days, security forces had conducted a series of “high tempo, intelligence-driven operations” aimed at eliminating Indian proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza.
Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process.
“It is significant to highlight that the killed kharji has been identified as an Afghan national,” the statement said.
It went on to say that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, three militants were killed, it said.
According to ISPR, 10 terrorists were killed in Narmi Khel in KP’s Bannu district while 12 were killed in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali.
It went on to say that troops also conducted an IBO in Sambaza in Balochistan’s Zhob district.
“After an intense fire exchange, eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were successfully neutralised,” it said.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it said.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers,” the statement said, adding that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists.
The statement concluded that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for their successful operations against Fitna Al Hindustan and Fitna Al Khwarij terrorists.
He said that the killing of the terrorists and the recovery of weapons reflected the professional performance of security forces.
He stressed that the security forces and law enforcement agencies should continue their efforts to eradicate terrorism in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“There should be no let-up in operations against terrorists who are active with external backing, to ensure national security and the protection of the people,” he said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, also paid tribute to Pakistan’s security forces.
He further stated that Pakistan’s security forces continued to achieve battlefield successes against terrorist organisations each day. He reaffirmed that the government was determined to eliminate terrorism from the country.
Earlier this week, security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during IBOs in Balochistan and KP.</p><small>2026-02-25 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251917099293e82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975691/iran-sees-good-outlook-for-talks-with-us-as-negotiating-team-heads-to-geneva' target='_blank'><strong>Iran sees ‘good outlook’ for talks with US as negotiating team heads to Geneva</strong></a><br><p>Iran sees the chance of a good outcome from a third round of talks with the United States, its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday, as a delegation left for Geneva for negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
A senior US official said on Monday that envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are slated to meet with the Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Thursday.
The two countries resumed negotiations over the long-disputed nuclear programme earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East ahead of possible strikes on the Islamic Republic.
Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked.
Trump on February 19 said he was giving Tehran about 10 to 15 days to make a deal.
“In relation to the talks, we see a good outlook, tomorrow in the meeting that Dr Araqchi will hold in Geneva … we have tried, with the guidance of the supreme leader, to manage this process to get out of the no war, no peace situation,” Pezeshkian said in comments carried by state media.
Araqchi said on Tuesday that a deal with the US was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”.
The US and Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel’s existence.
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb.</p><small>2026-02-25 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251200097077ee2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975663/highway-between-kp-and-punjab-reopened-following-closure-due-to-suicide-attack-at-checkpost-in-bhakkar' target='_blank'><strong>Highway between KP and Punjab reopened following closure due to suicide attack at checkpost in Bhakkar</strong></a><br><p>DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The main inter-provincial highway linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Punjab was reopened to traffic on Wednesday after remaining closed for several hours following a suicide attack at the Dajil checkpost in Bhakkar.
The road had been sealed after a suicide attack at the inter-provincial checkpost on Tuesday evening, leaving two police officials martyred. Following the attack, authorities suspended traffic as a precautionary measure and launched a search operation.
Officials said the Dera Darya Khan bridge was reopened for all kinds of traffic on Wednesday after consultations between the district administrations of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.
Traffic was restored once security clearance was completed and necessary checks were carried out.
It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.
Traders against repeated closures
The continued closure of the inter-provincial route caused significant inconvenience to travellers and transporters. Vehicles remained stranded for hours, and passengers were forced to seek alternative routes at additional expense.
The disruption comes days after the same route remained blocked for several days due to protests by the PTI, which had already affected the movement of goods and people.
Earlier in the day, traders in DI Khan said repeated closures had disrupted supply lines from Punjab, particularly from Lahore and other major commercial centres.
President of the Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajiran, Sohail Ahmed Azmi, said the prolonged suspension of traffic was compounding the difficulties faced by the business community.
He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets.
Azmi had urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship.
Punjab IG visits checkpost
Meanwhile,  Punjab Inspector Genera Rao Abdul Kareem visited the checkpost and inspected the site of the explosion.
During the visit, the regional police officer Sargodha and the district police officer Bhakkar briefed him about the initial findings and evidence collected from the scene.
The IG directed that security be further tightened at all inter-provincial checkposts across Punjab and instructed officials to ensure strict implementation of standard operating procedures.
He appreciated the morale of the personnel and said those involved in the attack would be brought to justice, adding that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain.
Senior officers, including the additional IG of the Counter-Terrorism Department, accompanied him during the visit.</p><small>2026-02-25 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25173719e4b41c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975684/pm-shehbaz-stresses-need-for-reducing-direct-taxes-in-upcoming-budget-to-facilitate-business-community' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz stresses need for reducing direct taxes in upcoming budget to facilitate business community</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday stressed the need for reducing direct taxes “across the board” in the upcoming budget to facilitate the business community.
The premier made the remarks while addressing the inaugural session of the two-day Pakistan Governance Forum 2026, which was attended by businesspersons as well.
PM Shehbaz stressed the need for increasing economic growth, production, exports, investments and foreign direct investments (FDI), rather than relying on hiking taxes.
He said: “I believe that in the upcoming budget — which will come a few months later — we must decrease direct taxes across the board so that businesspersons and investors are facilitated.
“My entire team and I are united on this that we must reduce taxes immediately,” he said, adding that businesspeople did not pay indirect taxes.
Noting that many businesspersons sitting among the audience understood the issue he was referring to, PM Shehbaz said, “You obtain the indirect tax from the consumers. But if you keep it in your pockets, then what can be a bigger injustice to the nation?”
The prime minister remarked that it was akin to a carrot and stick approach, adding that in his view “there could not be bigger injustice and oppression with the public” than keeping taxes coming from consumers in their pockets, rather than paying it to the government.
“This is why I want to tell you, without naming names, but I will name the industries: sugar, cement, tobacco,” PM Shehbaz stated.

 

He noted that there was an increase of Rs36 billion in tax recovery in the sugar sector in 2025 compared to 2024, and a Rs60bn increase in the cement sector during the same period.
The premier acknowledged that numerous “respected” industry leaders “honestly make payments” and pointed out that some not doing so resulted in an “unhealthy competition”.
“It has to be a whole-of-government approach in which provinces, Centre, military leadership, all of us have to work together,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz recalled that he held meetings with various business sectors to make decisions after consultations with them.
He asserted, “I believe that it is not the government’s duty to run businesses, […] it is that of businesspersons.
“The government’s duty is to facilitate them, to provide them whatever the government can do to support their efforts in terms of productivity, more efficiency, research and development, exports, and so forth,” he added.







“There is no lack of anything; if anything is lacking, it is will,” the premier remarked.
“Hard work, day and night, is required,” he said. “We do not have the luxury of time; we will have to act and act speedily if we want to regain our lost standing.”
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also addressed the event.
Power Minister Awais Leghari, Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and British High Commissioner Jane Marriot were among those present in the audience.</p><small>2026-02-25 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2520114222c9f05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975685/pakistan-wary-of-militant-attacks-after-afghanistan-air-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan wary of militant attacks after Afghanistan air strikes</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has boosted security and arrested dozens of suspects as it fears a rising wave of militant attacks following its air strikes in Afghanistan, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Wednesday.
“Our forces are on high-alert to combat any attacks,” Chaudhry told Reuters.
“You know the militants always react whenever we go after their hideouts in Afghanistan.”
Pakistan carried out air strikes on targets in Afghanistan over the weekend on what it said were militant targets responsible for a spate of recent suicide bombings on Pakistani soil.
Islamabad blames Kabul for allowing the fighters to use Afghanistan as a safe haven. Kabul denies the charges, saying the militancy is Pakistan’s internal problem.
Pakistani and Afghan forces exchanged fire along their border on Tuesday, with each side accusing the other of initiating the clash.
There have also been a number of militant attacks, including the ambush of a police vehicle in Kohat in which five officers and two civilians were killed and a suicide bombing at a checkpoint that killed two policemen.
Chaudhry said the retaliatory attacks by militants proved Islamabad’s case that they had linkages in Afghanistan, adding that the forces had averted several attacks in recent weeks and arrested a number of suspects, including Afghans.
Security forces have accelerated search and intelligence based operations and “have arrested dozens of suspected militants, their handlers and their facilitators,” the minister said.
Multiple sources added that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies have issued alerts for a possible surge in terror attacks in Pakistan in coming days.
Urban centres, markets, security forces and places of worship could be possible targets, according to the alerts, the sources said.
“We have been given a strong caution about more terror attacks in our official communications. In this regard, we have almost doubled our search operations across Pakistan,” said an intelligence official.
Militancy is a growing problem for Pakistan with the number of attacks rising every year since 2022, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), a global monitoring organisation.
Data from ACLED shows attacks in Pakistan rose nearly fourfold to 2,425 in 2025 from 658 in 2022 and over the same period, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) attacks increased more than seven-fold to 838 from 118.</p><small>2026-02-25 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25163221421df56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975678/imf-mission-opens-talks-with-central-bank-on-pakistans-loan-programmes' target='_blank'><strong>IMF mission opens talks with central bank on Pakistan’s loan programmes</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova on Wednesday began technical-level discussions with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in Karachi for the third review of the $7bn Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the second review of the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The mission will remain in Karachi this week and begin policy discussions with the federal and provincial governments on Monday, with the customary opening roundup with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The minister on Wednesday said the government was well-positioned for a successful review of its loan programmes.
Talking briefly to journalists after a parliamentary committee meeting, the minister said the government was also in a good position on collections by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).

 

Responding to a question, he said there was “absolutely no issue” with the rollover of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) safe deposits with the central bank and the sides were in constant contact.
The UAE’s $2bn deposit, usually rolled over on an annual basis, had expired more than two months ago and has since been on short-term rollovers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also spoke about the matter during a media talk, assuring that the UAE’s $2bn deposit would be rolled over.
“Talks are ongoing with the UAE government regarding the rollover,” he said, adding that the deposits would be “automatically rolled over”.
Pakistan has been dependent on continuous annual rollovers of safe deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as $12.5bn from these countries form part of the foreign financing needs under the EFF.
During the almost two-week review by the IMF mission, ending March 11, the engagements will be of greater significance as both sides will also discuss programme performance for the half-year ending December 31, 2025.
Further, forward-looking preparations, including budget proposals based on the performance for this year and the setting up of broad contours of the upcoming budget will also come under discussion.

 

This would involve provincial reviews for now and the future, particularly those relating to provincial finances, including agriculture income tax and governance-related challenges, as well as an action plan to address those weaknesses causing trillions of rupees worth of economic losses.
In this regard, procurement and accountability agencies would be under added scrutiny, including their independence, institutional capacities, processes and performances.
The programme’s performance as of the end of December 2025 — the period under review — has mostly been up to the mark, albeit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities believe can be reduced following a recent decision by the Federal Constitutional Court regarding the super tax, which was in the government’s favour.
The two sides will also review all macroeconomic indicators for the third quarter still in progress.
The power sector will also remain under added scrutiny given volatile policymaking in the recent months, including those relating to the industrial sector, residential fixed charges and so on, although circular debt numbers are within the target range.
On the positive side, Pakistan has met almost all quantitative performance criteria for the period under review. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation.
Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance and forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
On the technical side, Pakistan will likely meet almost all seven quantitative performance indicators.
Net international reserves are likely to remain slightly lower than the $7bn benchmark for September 2025 and below $6bn for December 2025 against the $6.5bn benchmark.
The central bank’s net domestic assets are estimated at around Rs12.5-13.5 trillion, versus the ceiling target of Rs14.9-15.1tr for September and December 2025.
It should be mentioned that the lending agency’s spokesperson said last week that policy efforts undertaken by Pakistan under the EFF had “helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence”.</p><small>2026-02-25 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2517521903f264f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975656/indias-modi-lands-in-israel-to-strengthen-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi lands in Israel to ‘strengthen cooperation’</strong></a><br><p>India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening ties with a key trade and defence partner, a trip that has drawn criticism at home.
It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister.
In a post on X, the Indian prime minister said that he has landed in Israel.
“I am extremely honoured to be received by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs Netanyahu at the airport. I look forward to engaging in bilateral discussions and fruitful outcomes that strengthen the India-Israel friendship,” he added.







In a statement prior to his departure, Modi said, “Our nations share a robust and multifaceted strategic partnership”. He also said he would meet Netanyahu and address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
“Ties have significantly strengthened in the last few years.”
New Delhi has steadily expanded co-operation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cyber-security sectors while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East.
Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that total merchandise trade was $3.62 billion in 2024–2025.
Modi said he would hold talks with Netanyahu to “discuss ways to strengthen co-operation”, as well as meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Herzog replied to him on X, saying that the state and the people of Israel looked forward to welcoming him.







Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014.
Modi visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
Both right-wing leaders have called each other a “friend”.







In September 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor – to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 actions against Israel, which responded with a devastating war in the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians.
One of India’s largest conglomerates, Adani Group, operates the Mediterranean port of Haifa, while Israeli military drone technology was deployed against Pakistan during the conflict between the two nuclear powers in May 2025.
At the same time, India maintains strong relations with Gulf nations and Tehran, including developing Iran’s Chabahar port — a trade gateway to Afghanistan, where New Delhi has built a relationship with Taliban authorities.
Modi displaying ‘moral cowardice’: Congress
On the other hand, the opposition Indian National Congress launched a scathing attack on Modi over his visit to Israel.
Senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — said she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” when he addresses Israel’s parliament and demand “justice for them”.
“India has stood for what is right throughout our history as an independent nation, we must continue to show the light of truth, peace and justice to the world,” she said on X.







Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu.
He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”.
“On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled.







Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4bn people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

A day earlier, the PTI founder was taken to the hospital for follow-up treatment of his eye ailment, which came to light in late January. However, his party took exception to the ‘secrecy’ surrounding this procedure and the complete exclusion of family members from this process.
The opposition has also repeatedly demanded that cases of the incarcerated PTI founder be fixed for an early hearing.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Aleema said the health of the PTI founder was the family’s primary concern and insisted that no decision regarding his treatment should be made without their permission.
Referring to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statement from February 17 regarding Imran’s health, she said the minister had publicly claimed that Imran had received medical treatment, but no one from the party leadership could confirm the nature of that treatment.
In his statement, Naqvi had also accu­sed Aleema of trying to exploit her incarcerated brother’s health issues for political gains.
“Why doesn’t anyone deny or confirm what treatment was carried out?” Aleema asked.
She alleged that the family had recommended doctors, including Dr Asim, Dr Uzma Khan and Dr Barki, for examination at Shifa International Hospital. Still, their names were either rejected, or no response was given.
She claimed the family later learned that treatment had been conducted at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and that they were kept unaware of developments.
“We were demanding treatment at Shifa International Hospital. Instead, we were sent to jail when we raised the issue,” she said.
She further alleged that pressure was being exerted on government doctors and said the family would no longer communicate concerns in closed-door meetings but would raise them publicly.
Aleema also questioned the silence of senior PTI lawyers and office-bearers, naming Hamid Khan, Ali Zafar, Latif Khosa and Barrister Gohar, and asked why they were not actively pursuing the founder’s cases.
“Where are the senior lawyers who were given party tickets? The founder repeatedly asked them to get his cases filed,” she said.
She claimed that information about meetings and medical arrangements was coming from Naqvi instead of party representatives. “Will we get information from the minister or from our own party?” she asked.
Expressing frustration, she remarked that the party appeared “as relaxed as if Imran Khan has been treated,” adding that if anyone could not bear the burden of the PTI founder’s narrative, they should step aside.
On the matter of the delay in cases being fixed, Aleema said the PTI founder had been coming to court for the past 13 months to pursue his cases, but hurdles were being created.
“We come and sit in court for hours, but cases are not fixed,” she said, adding that on one occasion, when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi appeared in court and attempted to speak, the chief justice left the courtroom.
Aleema maintained that the “chair of justice” existed to provide relief to the people and claimed that courts elsewhere in the world did not function in such a manner.
Separately, senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja told the media that court orders regarding meetings with the PTI founder were not being implemented.
He added the IHC had ordered two weekly meetings — one for lawyers and one for family members — but alleged that meetings were not arranged despite the appearance of the KP chief minister.
Raja further claimed that contempt petitions filed over non-compliance were not heard and that the high court had become a “closed door” for the party. He added that applications for medical examination had also not been taken up.
“In one case related to [X account], the court directed that we meet the party founder and file a response. How can we file a reply without meeting him?” he questioned, alleging that proceedings continued without facilitating the meeting.

 

Raja said the party would approach the Supreme Court if relief was not granted.
KP CM also spoke to reporters, saying he had attempted to address Chief Justice Dogar in open court but was not heard.
“I went to the rostrum while fasting and greeted the chief justice, but he did not respond,” he said, adding that PTI wanted to demonstrate peaceful protest rather than agitation.
Meanwhile, Barrister Salman Safdar said that if bail cases were not fixed for hearing, the matter would be taken directly to the SC. Later, the IHC administration fixed an early hearing plea for Thursday.
Gohar acknowledges communication gap within party leadership
Separately, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also arrived at the IHC. Addressing the media upon his arrival, Gohar said that the party leadership had decided to pursue its cases before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and he had made an appearance there before arriving at the IHC.
He acknowledged a communication gap within the party leadership but stressed that all leaders were making sincere and coordinated efforts to secure Imran’s release.
The PTI chairman also congratulated the newly elected office-bearers of the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association, saying that “dynamic individuals are stepping forward” to lead the journalist community.
In a conversation with IHCJA President Asad Malik and General Secretary Asif Naveed, Gohar assured the association of his party’s full support on issues facing journalists.
“Wherever you encounter difficulties, we will raise our voice and extend our cooperation wherever it is required,” he said, adding that PTI would stand by the journalist community in its struggle for rights and professional freedom.
He further stated that his party would raise its voice against the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), particularly regarding concerns about restrictions on freedom of expression.
Gohar maintained that the PTI would continue to advocate for journalists’ rights, especially against what he described as language restrictions imposed on media personnel, reiterating that freedom of expression is indispensable for a democratic society.
He also assured journalists that the party would take up the issue of the unannounced and prolonged ban on Dawn’s advertisements in Parliament, terming it a curtailment of press freedom.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2517474996bb513.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975677/italian-minister-says-decision-to-issue-10500-work-visas-for-pakistanis-aimed-at-promoting-legal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Italian minister says decision to issue 10,500 work visas for Pakistanis aimed at promoting ‘legal migration’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi reiterated a decision made last year to issue visas to over 10,000 skilled Pakistani workers, saying that it was aimed at promoting “legal migration”.
Italy would issue 10,500 work visas for Pakistan’s skilled workers to promote “legal migration”, he said during a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in Rome, according to a statement issued by the interior ministry.
In December last year, an agreement was reached between Pakistan and Italy, under which the latter had allocated a labour quota for the former.
According to the agreement, 10,500 Pakis­tani workers will be provided employment in various sectors in Italy, including ship brea­king, hospitality, healthcare and agriculture.
Each year, 3,500 Pakistani workers will sec­ure overseas jobs under seasonal and non-seasonal quotas, as per the agreement.
Visa-free entry for diplomatic passport holders
During the meeting, it was also decided that Pakistani diplomatic passport holders would be allowed visa-free entry to Italy.
This decision, the statement said, was taken at Naqvi’s request.
It added that the Italian minister recalled that his Pakistani counterpart had raised this matter at a previous meeting.
Discussion on illegal immigration
Moreover, the two sides reviewed internal security cooperation between Pakistan and Italy, as well as measures to curb illegal immigration during the meeting, the statement said.
The two ministers also discussed enhancing cooperation in combating narcotics trafficking, human smuggling, and terrorism, it said, adding that  both sides appreciated the ongoing measures to prevent illegal immigration and human smuggling.
Naqvi apprised his counterpart of the measures taken by the Pakistani government to curb illegal immigration, elaborating that strict monitoring at airports and maritime borders had led to a “significant reduction” in the practice.
For his part, the Italian minister appreciated Pakistan’s “effective policies” for addressing the issue of illegal immigration, the statement said, adding that he also commended the achievements of Pakistani institutions in tackling illegal immigration, human smuggling, and drug trafficking.
“Both sides agreed to enhance mutual cooperation to promote legal migration, and the Italian interior minister reaffirmed his country’s readiness to expand cooperation with Pakistan in areas of shared interest,” according to the statement.
During the meeting, officers from Punjab police also briefed the participants on the utility and effectiveness of the Police Khidmat Markaz Global initiative.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to Italy, Ali Javed, Federal Investigation Agency Director General Dr Usman Anwar, Punjab Safe City Authority Managing Director Ahsan Younas and senior police officers were also present at the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25172031c71d6b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975681/e-visas-introduced-for-pakistanis-travelling-to-uk' target='_blank'><strong>E-visas introduced for Pakistanis travelling to UK</strong></a><br><p>Pakistanis, including tourists, travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) will now be able to do so with an e-visa, receiving confirmation by email rather than stickers in passports, according to a statement issued by the British High Commission on Wednesday.
In July 2025, the UK government introduced an e-visa system for Pakistanis; however, it was limited to study or work visas. Applicants applying for general visitor visas were still required to obtain a physical visa.
In the statement released on Wednesday, the high commission said visitors would continue to submit their applications online and attend a visa application centre to provide biometrics.
It said that successful applicants would have a digital record of their immigration status provided through an e-visa, accessible through an online UK Visas and Immigration account.
“It means applicants no longer need to attend a visa application centre a second time to collect their passport, instead holding on to it after their biometrics session,” the commission said.
It said that e-visas provided a more secure way to manage immigration status and reduce the risk of lost or damaged documents.
“Applicants can generate a share code to prove their visa status at borders and elsewhere. There is no change to visa processing times, eligibility criteria or conditions,” it said.
The statement also quoted British High Commissioner Jane Marriott as saying that this was a “hugely exciting step” for Pakistanis travelling to the UK.
“As well as being able to save time by holding on to your passport, the new share code system makes it easier than ever to demonstrate your visa status,” she said.
Separately, in a video message posted on her X account on Wednesday, Marriot said that “nearly all visitors going to the UK can now use the new e-visa service when they travel”.







She said that under the new system, travellers will be able to keep their passports with them as they will not be required to hand them in.
She added that the “major difference is that you get to keep your passport with you and you no longer need to visit a visa centre for a second time (to pick up your passport)”.
She further said that “the process and application timelines have not changed”.
In 2024, the UK government had announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p><small>2026-02-25 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25164204253b1e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975679/56-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-islamabad-parts-of-kp' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude earthquake jolts Islamabad, parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>A 5.6-magnitude earthquake jolted Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday.
The tremors were felt in Peshawar, Chitral, Swat, Swabi, Bajaur, Mardan, Charsadda and Mansehra, DawnNewsTV reported, adding that they were also felt in Islamabad.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the quake struck at 4:12pm at a depth of 114 kilometres. It said the earthquake’s epicentre was Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush region.
The department also added that the quake was felt in Islamabad, Swat, Peshawar and Chitral. Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
Last week, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of KP, with tremors felt in Shangla, Swat, Mardan, Swabi and Nowshera.</p><small>2026-02-25 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25133223d61ba0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975667/pti-moves-sc-for-imrans-treatment-at-hospital-of-choice-access-to-personal-doctors' target='_blank'><strong>PTI moves SC for Imran’s treatment at hospital of choice, access to personal doctors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court seeking the medical treatment of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a hospital of his choice, along with access to his personal physicians.
The application, filed by PTI lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa under Order XXXV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, comes after Imran underwent a government-facilitated follow-up treatment for his eye ailment.
The application, available with Dawn, was filed on behalf of Imran and named the Islamabad district election commissioner as the respondent, as it invoked the Toshakhana case in which the PTI founder was first arrested on Aug 5, 2023.
The plea requested the SC that Imran be “immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad for proper treatment of his eyes from [a] retina specialist”.
It may be mentioned that Shifa International Hospital — where Imran’s family and personal doctors want him to be taken — is in Islamabad, whereas Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, a doctor of which was involved in Tuesday’s treatment, is located in Rawalpindi.
The plea also sought Imran’s access to his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf, “who may be associated with all the procedures of examination and treatment”.







“It is also prayed that the petitioner’s family members be duly informed and grant reasonable access to them during his medical check-up and treatment,” the application added.
The petition requested that Imran’s lawyer be provided with attested copies of medical reports and checkups carried out regarding the ex-premier.
The lawyer may also be “granted reasonable access to his client for updated instruction for his effective representation before this Honourable court and so as to enable complete justice to the petitioner,” the plea added.
In his application, Khosa highlighted that Imran was 73 years old, adding that “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“The conduct of a medical examination in secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions,” he contended.
Referring to Imran’s Tuesday hospital visit, Khosa pointed out that the procedure was conducted in the absence of the former premier’s personal physicians, family members, and lawyers.
“Nothing is known regarding the outcome of the petitioner’s medical examination and or procedures conducted in Pims hospital. Such secrecy is mindboggling and not acceptable on any hypothesis,” he added.
Following Imran’s follow-up treatment, a hospital doctor stated that the former was “clinically stable”, with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also providing details about it to the Senate.
Khosa pointed out that the February 15 examination at Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned, was also conducted in the absence of his family members, personal doctors or legal representatives.
He rejected the government’s claims of certain family and party members voluntarily choosing not to come despite being informed as “wholly incorrect and unrealistic”.
“At no stage were the petitioner’s family members, personal physicians, or counsel informed. In fact, when the petitioner’s sisters approached the authorities, they were denied access. Instead, a panel of handpicked doctors was formed to conduct the examination,” the plea asserted.
Khosa recalled that in a February 16 communication through him, Imran requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan, “seeking appropriate orders for compliance of his medical examination and shifting to the Shifa International Hospital for treatment of his ailment as no retina specialist is available in Pims”.
The counsel argued: “The insistence of the petitioner’s treatment from Pims where no retina specialist exists, continued exclusion of the petitioner’s family and personal medical practitioners from information concerning his health has created unavoidable doubts.
“Such secrecy not only undermines confidence in the medical process but is also causing unrest and distress among his family members, friends and supporters,” he argued.
Gohar laments pending cases before IHC
Separately, speaking outside the SC, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said his party’s parliamentarians will go to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday at noon to seek the fixation of Imran’s pending cases.
He highlighted that the PTI has approached the IHC 17 times and the SC 14 times in the past year.
“We have only one demand: fix Khan sahib’s cases, hear them and make decisions based on justice,” Gohar told reporters.
The PTI leader recalled that the party has already moved the SC for Imran’s access to his lawyers in multiple ongoing cases, noting that an application related to his health has now been filed too.
Referring to his meeting with the SC registrar on Tuesday, Gohar said the registrar had told them to file an application for the “next hearing” via the advocate-on-record (AOR).
Subsequently, Gohar added, they submitted an application today via the AOR for fixing the plea regarding Imran’s health and doctors “as soon as possible”.
“I hope that the way the Supreme Court has made a commitment, this plea will be fixed for hearing,” the PTI chairman said.
Barrister Gohar lamented that the pleas regarding the suspension of sentence in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the second Toshakhana case had not been fixed for hearing yet.

 

He highlighted that the Al Qadir case plea had been pending for over a year, even though such cases “should be decided within 35 and 60 days as per the Judicial Policy”.
Gohar noted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi paid a visit to the IHC today.
However, Gohar said he was “saddened” upon IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar not giving the KP CM a “positive response”.
“We have been told on behalf of the chief justice and the registrar that both the Toshakhana and Al Qadir cases will be fixed for hearing at the IHC tomorrow,” Gohar said.
Imran’s ailment and treatment
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January, with concerns mounting after partial vision loss in one eye was reported via a lawyer who met the incarcerated former premier upon the SC’s intervention.
A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.

 

Since then, the government and the opposition have been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him.
The government denies these allegations.
Imran’s first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later. A follow-up visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) was made in the early hours of February 24.
The PTI founder’s family, party, and the opposition strongly objected to the manner in which it was carried out, lamenting that they had not been informed in advance.</p><small>2026-02-25 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25132230b19fc19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975666/6-killed-in-firing-mortar-attack-on-kech-house-dsp' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed in firing, mortar attack on Kech house: DSP</strong></a><br><p>GWADAR: Six people, including the attacker, were killed and four others were injured in a shooting and mortar attack at a house in the Minaz locality of Kech district’s Buleda tehsil, a police official said.
Initially, police sources said six members of a family, including three children, were killed when assailants opened indiscriminate gunfire and launched a mortar strike.
Later, Buleda Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Talal Gichki stated that an attacker was among the six dead in the incident, while four others were injured.
“Firing continued for one and a half hours. During the exchange of fire, a rocket fell on a hut,” the DSP said, adding that the entire residence got burned down as a result.
Over a dozen cattle were also lost as a result of the attack.
Following the incident, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace the attackers.
Police sources said an investigation was under way and the matter was being probed from multiple angles.
On February 16, unidentified armed men shot dead a man from Faisalabad in the Pishukan area of Gwadar.
In November last year, three bullet-riddled bodies, including that of a newly married man, were found in Gwadar’s Tump tehsil.

In a notification issued by the Punjab home department, available with Dawn, a complete ban on the outside flying of drones was announced under Section 144 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which is to remain in force “for a period of 30 days from the date of issuance or until withdrawn earlier”.
However, the notification said that the ban did not apply to “use of small drones for coverage of indoor activities, such as in halls or marquees”.
It further added that the ban was also not applicable to “drones used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies”.
The home department noted that “credible reports and prevailing circumstances indicate that the increasing and unregulated use of drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) within the territorial limits of Punjab poses potential risks to public safety, security of public and private property and the maintenance of public order”.
It added that drone activity also “may cause obstruction to official duties, create law and order concerns, and disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the province”.
It termed the ban “essential” in ensuring the “security of the people and installations/buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquility and to avoid any untoward incident”.
It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the launch of an anti-drone unit in Punjab to combat any terrorist attack, besides directing the installation of the latest digital scanners at the province’s entry and exit points.</p><small>2026-02-25 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251101075c614f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975658/kse-100-plunges-over-1600-points-closes-in-the-red' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 plunges over 1,600 points, closes in the red</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the red on Wednesday, down 1632.25 points from its previous close of 166,258.54.

This follows Tuesday’s particularly turbulent session that saw the index swing from an intraday gain of 1,546 points to a steep decline of 3,783 points as selling pressure intensified.
Analysts at Topline Securities note that the benchmark was primarily impacted by weak investor sentiment and futures rollover pressure.

Adaptation and resilience must move from paper to action.
Climate change is no longer a future threat, but a lived reality in Pakistan today, manifesting regularly in the form of melting glaciers and heat waves, erratic rainfall, and flooding. According to the United Nations Development Programme, rising global temperatures are accelerating glacier retreat in Pakistan, with almost 10,000 glaciers having receded in recent years, leading to floods and future water scarcity.
Meanwhile, erratic rainfall patterns have made the country vulnerable to floods and droughts. The 2025 monsoon season displaced about 3.5 million people in Pakistan and left 1.6m in Sindh at the risk of flooding, per data compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.



Sindh suffered an estimated loss of Rs32.2 billion last year due to these climate anomalies, which range from urban flooding and heatwaves in urban areas to droughts and livelihood damage in rural villages. These trends, now backed by scientific and meteorological data, underscore the need for both mitigation and adaptation strategies that are locally grounded.
And this is exactly what was discussed at length during Climate Week Karachi 2026; that resilience is not just an environmental necessity but a socioeconomic need. When there is a lack of early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and equitable access to finance, vulnerable communities bear the brunt of climate shocks.
Climate finance in Pakistan
In the past few years, Pakistan has initiated several climate finance initiatives — both domestic and international — to build adaptive capacity.
In 2024, Pakistan launched the National Climate Finance Strategy to mobilise and streamline funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as to strengthen institutions and enhance transparency. The next year, the government issued its first sovereign Green Sukuk, a Shariah-compliant instrument that raised significant capital of around Rs30 billion for climate-aligned investments. Similarly, Green bonds were also introduced to fund environmentally sustainable projects.
Apart from local initiatives, the country secured more than $1.5 billion in climate finance from global sources, including the International Monetary Fund’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility ($1.4 billion) and Green Climate Fund (GCF) commitments. The latter has approved a number of projects in Pakistan addressing flood risk management, smart agriculture, urban transit emissions, and distributed solar deployment.
In late 2025, Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank signed climate resilience projects worth $304.5 million, including the Sindh Coastal Resilience Sector Project, designed to improve water resource management, restore nature-based defence, and enhance planning capacities for coastal communities in Thatta, Sujawal, and Badin districts.
Similarly, the World Bank has also approved $102 million for the Resilient and Accessible Microfinance (RAM) Project, aimed at strengthening access to finance for vulnerable populations, especially in the face of climate shocks and disasters.
Where the system still falls short
But even after all the progress Pakistan has achieved in mobilising climate finance, there remains a profound gap between available resources and their translation into effective local-level resilience-building against climate change. This particularly holds true for Sindh.
In a 2018 research paper, the World Bank referred to the southeastern province as the country’s most vulnerable hotspot, owing to its geographic location, population concentration, lack of access to infrastructure, and climate-induced disasters (floods, heatwaves and droughts).



The economic implications of this vulnerability are stark. The UNDP, in its policy paper, ‘Cost of Inaction on Climate Change’, estimated that unmitigated climate impacts could impose losses — damage to agriculture, health infrastructure and productivity — equivalent to about 20 per cent of Sindh’s gross domestic product.
On the other hand, the costs of avoiding or reducing these impacts would amount to 2.5pc of the province’s GDP, the paper noted, highlighting how proactive adaptation and resilience investment could translate into a large economic return.
Simply put, delayed or insufficient climate action is not just an environmental risk but a macroeconomic liability for all, especially in Sindh.
Decentralisation and access
One of the core weaknesses in Pakistan’s climate finance system lies in its highly centralised structure. Climate finance, especially international funds, is commonly routed through federal ministries and other implementing agencies, even though responsibility for key climate-sensitive sectors such as water management, agriculture, urban development, and disaster response rests primarily with provincial and local governments.
This institutional mismatch limits provinces and municipalities from designing and implementing projects that respond directly to local climate risks.
Analysis conducted by the Consortium for Development Policy Research, a Pakistan-based research and dissemination organisation, highlights that fiscal and constitutional arrangements for climate action plans, including approval, restructuring, and disbursement majorly reside at the federal level, while the responsibility for implementation resides at the provincial level.
This structure of centralised control creates delays and gaps.

 

Case in point: the Sindh Coastal Resilience Project. Formalised at the end of 2025, its preparatory phase laid bare the common administrative and access risks that Pakistan’s climate financing ecosystem faces.
The project was launched to protect coastal livelihoods, food security, and ecosystems in climate-vulnerable districts of Thatta, Sujawal and Badin. But even as it was designed for Sindh and implemented by provincial institutions, the project’s grants — from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Green Climate Fund — were formally negotiated and signed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs.
So even when it is by Sindh, for Sindh and to Sindh, the province does not have direct access to the full financing envelope. Instead, all of the approvals, fund releases, and compliance requirements flow through federal channels, lengthening preparation and implementation timelines.
This yet again proves that without streamlined mechanisms that pass access and management of climate funds down to the grassroots — provincial and municipal governments — vulnerable populations will continue to suffer.
Absorptive capacity and implementation gaps
The lack of access and control is not just limited to Sindh but plagues the entire country. Reports reveal how Pakistan’s capacity to absorb and utilise climate funds continues to be a bottleneck, with chronic underspending, delayed disbursements, and setbacks in project implementation.
For instance, the GCF’s $37 million ‘Transforming the Indus Basin with Climate Resilient Agriculture and Water Management’ project had disbursed less than 45pc of its funds by its original completion timeline. In its documents, the Fund prominently mentioned absorption capacity as a climate finance constraint in Pakistan.
Sindh’s experience demonstrates that limited absorptive capacity is not an abstract national problem but a project-level constraint with measurable consequences. Despite repeated climate shocks and sustained financing commitments, many projects have suffered delays, pointing to institutional and procedural barriers in converting approved funds into timely adaptation outcomes.
A prominent example is the Sindh Resilience Project, launched in 2016 and supported by the World Bank to strengthen flood and drought risk management in the province through infrastructural upgrades and institutional capacity building.
Originally scheduled to close in 2021, only half of the project’s planned sub-schemes have been completed as of 2024-2025. Several of its components are yet to begin. In its implementation status report, the World Bank blamed limited procurement bottlenecks, limited project management capacity and governance risks for the delays.
Similarly, the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Scheme (K-IV) has faced many challenges as well. The project, originally launched to supply 260 million gallons of water per day, has been repeatedly delayed since its inception in the early 2000s. As of 2025, K-IV remains only 60-65pc complete, with original timelines pushed back and costs escalating significantly from initial estimates.

 

A key driver of these delays has been the mismatch between budget allocations and implementation requirements, where the federal budget 2025-26 only earmarked Rs3.2 billion of the roughly Rs40 billion required to push the project towards completion. Coordination mechanisms, including redesign of project components and transfer of execution responsibility from provincial agencies to Wapda have also contributed to higher costs and deferred timelines, illustrating how absorptive capacity constraints can amplify vulnerabilities even when financing is available.
These project-level findings are backed by budget execution. An independent analysis of Sindh’s climate-relevant expenditures shows that less than half of the allocated climate funds were spent over a 15-16 year period, i.e. out of Rs48.8 billion allocated for climate-related departments, only Rs20.2 billion was spent, pointing to chronic under-utilisation.
Building a resilient future
All of this evidence suggests that climate change in Pakistan is no longer just about risk recognition or finance mobilisation. It is equally about whether existing institutions and frameworks can convert approved resources into a timely and local-level response, implementing reforms as the central task of the next phase of climate action.
For climate finance to yield a meaningful impact, Pakistan must first start with decentralising access by empowering provincial and municipal governments with direct financing windows and simplified procedures.
Next, it should build technical capacity at the local level for project design, planning and implementation, alongside strengthening monitoring and transparency mechanisms.
And most of all, the nation must integrate climate priorities into local and provincial development planning, thereby ensuring that resilience is embedded in decision-making across sectors.
Turning climate finance into real resilience requires political will, institutional reform, and a decisive shift toward localised climate governance. Without this, climate action will only be visible on paper.</p><small>2026-02-25 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2513243446b3221.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975665/israel-committed-two-thirds-of-record-press-killings-in-2025-cpj' target='_blank'><strong>Israel committed two-thirds of record press killings in 2025: CPJ</strong></a><br><p>A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, blaming Israel for two-thirds of the deaths.
It was the second consecutive annual record for press deaths and the deadliest year since the CPJ began collecting data more than three decades ago.
“Journalists are being killed in record numbers at a time when access to information is more important than ever,” CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement.

 

“We are all at risk when journalists are killed for reporting the news.” Over three-quarters of all the fatalities in 2025 were in conflict settings, the CPJ said in its report.
More than 60 per cent of the 86 members of the press killed by Israeli fire in 2025 were Palestinians reporting from Gaza, it added.

 

The Israeli military claims that it never “deliberately targets” journalists.
The number of journalists killed in Ukraine and Sudan also increased in 2025 compared to the year before.
The CPJ highlighted a rise in drones being used, with 39 cases documented, including 28 killings by Israel in Gaza and five by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan.
In Ukraine, four journalists were killed by Russian military drones, the highest annual number of journalist deaths in the war since 15 were killed in 2022.
Journalists are increasingly vulnerable due to a persistent culture of impunity, the CPJ said, noting a lack of transparent investigations into killings.
In Mexico, six journalists were killed in 2025, and all the cases remain unsolved. The Philippines saw three journalists shot dead.
Others were killed following their reporting on corruption, such as a Bangladeshi reporter hacked to death by suspects linked to a fraud ring, according to the CPJ report.
Similar organised crime-related deaths were recorded in India and Peru.
In Saudi Arabia, prominent columnist Turki al-Jasser was executed by the state after being convicted on several charges that the CPJ likened to “spurious national security and financial crime allegations” used to punish reporters.
It was the Gulf state’s first documented killing of a journalist since the 2018 death of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><small>2026-02-25 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25132217a0b3e04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975664/17-deaths-reported-during-basant-in-lahore-says-punjab-home-department-report-submitted-to-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>17 deaths reported during Basant in Lahore, says Punjab Home Department report submitted to LHC</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab home department submitted a report to the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday stating that 17 people died during the recent Basant festival in Lahore.
The three-day Basant festival was held in Lahore from February 6-8, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
However, despite the government’s emphasis on safety measures, over 100 accidents were reported in connection with the festival.
The petition, heard by Justice Owais Khalid, sought the details of deaths and injuries during Basant.
According to the report, three people died of electrocution during the festival, and two died after falling from trees. In addition, 12 people lost their lives falling from roofs, the report added.
The LHC also sought details of people injured by kite strings during Basant. According to the petitioner’s lawyer, Advocate Azhar Siddique, the data was not provided.
Earlier this month, the court summoned a police report on the deaths and injuries reported during the Basant festival while hearing petitions filed by the Judicial Activism Panel and others challenging the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
Upon its revival, under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, only thread-based kite strings were allowed to be manufactured and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings was strictly banned.
Other safety measures included the division of the provincial metropolis into three kite-flying zones under 24/7 surveillance, the installing of protective safety wires or antennas on motorcycles to prevent neck injuries, and a ban on aerial firing and the consumption of alcohol on rooftops during the festival.
After the festival, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” in Lahore. She also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.</p><small>2026-02-25 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251105504418273.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975653/trump-keeps-the-world-guessing-on-his-iran-options-during-annual-state-of-the-union-speech' target='_blank'><strong>Trump keeps the world guessing on his Iran options during annual State of the Union speech</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump opened the foreign-policy portion of his State of the Union address tonight with a carefully calibrated message on Iran, stating that his “preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy” while warning he would “never” allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon.
The formulation, which projected readiness for talks while keeping the option of military force deliberately ambiguous, reflected his broader doctrine of “peace through strength.”

Trump argued that a rebuilt US military and higher defence spending by Nato allies had strengthened Washington’s hand.
At the same time, he asserted that Iran was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States and complained: “We haven’t heard those secret words (from Iran): ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’”
He blamed Tehran for pursuing a “sinister nuclear program” and claimed that earlier US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities.
Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address lasted one hour and 47 minutes — the longest before a joint session of Congress in at least six decades, according to the American Presidency Project.

As American television commentators noted, the president turned the annual constitutional ritual into an extended political performance aimed at boosting his approval ratings and energising Republican voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections.
Trump also briefly brought South Asia into the address, highlighting his peacemaking role in ending the May 2025 war between Pakistan and India, claiming that his efforts “saved millions” of lives by preventing the conflict from turning nuclear.
“Pakistan and India … it would have been a nuclear war. Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared.
Repeating his claim that he had halted eight wars in his first 10 months in office, he snapped at sceptics in the chamber: “Isn’t it funny? Sick people,” while glancing toward those who laughed.
Despite weeks of the largest US military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, Trump did not signal whether he was prepared to order a strike on Iran. He waited more than an hour before addressing the issue and avoided any reference to the scale of American deployments in the region, underscoring a speech that, even on foreign policy, largely followed a domestic political script.
Trump accused Tehran and its allies of being responsible for roadside bombings that “have killed US service members and civilians.“ He also referred to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani, saying “we took out Soleimani” and that it had a “big impact”.

Within the same sweep of foreign affairs, he hailed what he called a “colossal victory for the security of the United States” in Venezuela and introduced Enrique Marquez, an opposition lawmaker freed from prison after the US abduction of President Nicolás Maduro, telling a relative in the gallery: “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight.”
The address began with a campaign-style flourish — “Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer, and stronger than ever before!” — and quickly led to a sharply polarised spectacle.

When Trump asked those who believed “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand, Republicans rose and applauded for several minutes while Democrats remained seated, prompting him to say: “You should be ashamed of yourselves, not standing up.”
Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib repeatedly shouted, “You have killed Americans!” and “You should be ashamed!” as the speech continued, while Al Green was escorted from the chamber earlier after waving a protest sign reading “Black People Aren’t Apes,” an apparent reference to a video Trump had reposted on Truth Social depicting the Obamas as apes.
Trump directed much of his gaze toward the Republican side, basking in applause, but as he moved into immigration, crime, election security, and gender issues, he increasingly addressed Democrats directly, saying:
“These people are crazy, I’m telling ya, they’re crazy … Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it just in the nick of time.”

On immigration, he renewed attacks on Somali Americans, referring to “the Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota” and arguing that “importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA, and it is the American people who pay the price”.
On economic policy, he criticised a recent Supreme Court decision against his tariffs as “very unfortunate” and said the duties would remain in place under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,” adding: “Congressional action will not be necessary.”
Turning to prices, he blamed Democrats for inflation and told Americans: “Just hold on a little while we’re getting it down, and soon you will see numbers that few people would think were possible to achieve.”
He also urged passage of the SAVE America Act, requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, a measure Democrats have pledged to block in the Senate.
At another point, Trump took aim at New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani as the “new communist mayor of New York City,” before adding in a softer aside: “I think he’s a nice guy. Bad policy, but nice guy.”

For much of the evening, the visual tableau — a president speaking almost exclusively to one side of the chamber while the other jeered — mirrored the substance: an address that fused campaign mobilisation at home with selective, carefully timed signals abroad, particularly on Iran, where the decisive choice between diplomacy and force remained conspicuously unstated.</p><small>2026-02-25 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25092103b607c4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975650/muslim-european-countries-condemn-israeli-attempts-aimed-at-de-facto-annexation-of-palestinian-land-in-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Muslim, European countries condemn Israeli attempts aimed at ‘de facto annexation’ of Palestinian land in West Bank</strong></a><br><p>Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, on Wednesday condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration.
Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X.







“We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.”
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement.
The statement, referring to the Trump-brokered Gaza ceasefire and the subsequent 20-point plan for Gaza, said it threatens any meaningful prospect of regional integration.
“We call on the Government of Israel to reverse them immediately, to respect its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that would result in permanent changes to the legal and administrative status of the occupied Palestinian Territory,” the statement said further.
According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution.
“In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.”
The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable.
“We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.”
The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard.
“We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.”
Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.</p><small>2026-02-25 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2507420723c6ee5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975604/marriyum-defends-punjab-cm-over-jet-purchase' target='_blank'><strong>Marriyum defends Punjab CM over jet purchase</strong></a><br><p>• Accuses PTI of running vilification campaign on social and mainstream media• Political leaders ask provincial govt to come clean on ‘extravagance’
LAHORE: Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb strongly condemned PTI activists and others for running a vilification campaign against Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz over the Punjab government’s decision to acquire a luxury jet.
CM Maryam has faced severe criticism from the opposition and some journalists regarding the government’s purchase of a luxury aircraft for her personal use.
“Elements engaged in character assassination against the CM on media and social media are affiliated with the PTI. The national media should expel and reject those operating under PTI’s foreign funding,” Ms Aurangzeb said in a statement on Tuesday.
She added that the PTI’s toxic mindset was spreading filth across social and mainstream media platforms, which was deeply regrettable.
The senior minister said the seeds of this vile, poisonous, and repugnant mindset were sown during PTI’s tenure. “This reflects the continuation of the PTI founder’s offensive thinking. The media should condemn the character assassination campaign against Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” she urged.
She further said that whenever legal action was taken against such campaigns, an outcry was raised in the name of curbing freedom of expression.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari described the PTI’s “gutter mentality” as a cancer clinging to the country and society.
The Punjab government acqui­red a luxury Gulfstream 19-seater jet worth between $38 million and $42 million (over Rs10bn) for the chief minister’s use.

 

Initially, the Punjab administration remained tight-lipped about the acquisition, but later claimed that it was part of a proposed airline project.
When questions arose about the absence of a roadmap for the airline, the government later stated that the previous plane used by CM Maryam had become old and needed replacement with a “safe new jet”.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the purchase as an “extravagant expenditure amid economic hardship”, arguing that it contradicted the government’s public calls for austerity while citizens face rising inflation, unemployment, and financial strain.
He argued that spending billions on a VIP aircraft is unjustifiable when a large portion of the population lives below the poverty line and the country relies heavily on foreign loans. He warned that PTI would hold those responsible accountable for what he termed misuse of public funds.
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Finance Muzammil Aslam pointed out that, while the federal PML-N government sold 75 per cent of Pakistan International Airlines shares for just Rs10 billion, the Punjab government purchased a jet for Rs11bn.
Similarly, Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that while the prime minister celebrated the PIA sale, his niece, CM Maryam Nawaz, went ahead and purchased a luxury aircraft for “elite” travel.

Pakistan have only one point from two Super Eight matches so now must win their final game and rely on other results going their way to have any hope of reaching the semi-finals.
“We know our fate is not in our hands,” he admitted, “But we need to beat Sri Lanka in our last match on Saturday and then hope other results go our way.”
“It’s not ideal, but it’s like this,” Shaheen said during a press conference after the match.

 

He also hailed Harry Brook’s century in the match against England as a “world-class knock”.
Brook reached his maiden T20 International hundred off 50 balls, with four sixes and 10 fours, as England went past their 165-run target with five balls to spare to win by two wickets.
Afridi jolted the England top order with a burst of three wickets before Brook played the ultimate captain’s innings to steer his side home.
“In my opinion this will be the best innings of his life,” Afridi told reporters. “It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took the game away from us.”
Promoted to number three after a morning conversation with England coach Brendon McCullum, Brook walked in after Afridi dismissed Phil Salt off the first ball of the innings.
Afridi then removed Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell to leave England wobbling at 35-3 in the power play.
Brook stood firm, adding 45 for the fifth wicket with Sam Curran and 52 with Will Jacks for the sixth.
His century was the second fastest in T20 World Cup history, and the first ever by a team’s captain.
Only West Indies great Chris Gayle, against England in the 2016 T20 World Cup, reached three figures quicker. He took just 47 balls.
Afridi was clobbered for a six and a four as Brook raced through the “nervous nineties” in two balls, going from 90 to 100 before raising his bat.
The tall paceman bowled Brook with a yorker next ball, but did not celebrate wildly – instead he immediately went to congratulate the England captain in a superb show of cricket sportmanship.
“Brook played proper cricketing shots and he desreved a handshake, so I went to him and shook his hand in appreciation,” said Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 19:14</small></div><hr>
