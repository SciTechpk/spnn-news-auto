The announcement from President Trump came at a time when protests were raging in the Islamic Republic amid a severe crackdown, resulting in the death of at least 500 people, as per a rights monitor.
The statement marked a sharp escalation in Washi­n­gton’s long-running campaign of economic pressure against Iran.
Issued via social media and declared “effective immediately”, the statement by President Trump seeks to recast tariffs not as a trade remedy but as an instrument of foreign policy enforcement, with global reach and few visible limits.
The language of the post is categorical. Any country that maintains commercial ties with Iran, regardless of scale or sector, would see its exports to the US penalised.
This is not a sanction in the conventional sense. Iran is already subject to extensive American restrictions. Instead, it is a secondary measure aimed squarely at third countries, forcing them to weigh their economic engagement with Tehran against continued access to the US market.
Pakistan is also in a bind due to the latest Trump move. Its bilateral trade with Iran, estimated at around $3 billion annually, has grown steadily and is often conducted through barter or local currency arrangements, reflecting both sanctions constraints and Pakistan’s own dollar shortages. At the same time, the US remains a major export destination and a key player in Pakistan’s external ties.
A 25pc tariff layered onto existing US duties would directly affect Pakistan’s key exports, particularly at a time of economic fragility, while a sharp reduction in trade with Iran would have implications for energy supply, border economies and regional connectivity. Pakistan has limited options to circumvent this “final and conclusive” order by the US president.
With the possibility of exemptions almost non-existent, Islamabad can either attempt to further informalise trade with Iran or scale back engagement at a domestic economic cost. But none of these choices is without consequence.
The US move fits squarely within Trump’s revived “maximum pressure” doctrine, first deployed after Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. Then, the emphasis was on financial isolation through banking sanctions and oil export restrictions. Now, the pressure is being extended through tariffs, shifting the burden from firms and banks to entire national economies.
Yet the announcement leaves critical questions unanswered. The most basic concern is the definition of “doing business.” The phrase is left deliberately broad. It could be read to include all forms of trade, investment, services or financial interaction, without any threshold or exemption. There is no explanation about whether humanitarian trade, such as food and medicine, is excluded, nor whether legacy contracts or indirect transactions would be treated differently.
Equally unclear is the scope of “any and all business being done with the United States.” Tariffs under US law apply to imported goods, not services or capital flows. If interpreted narrowly, the measure would still raise effective tariff rates significantly for countries trading with Iran, some of whom are already subject to existing duties. If interpreted expansively, it would push beyond established legal authority and invite domestic and international challenges.
The question of currency is ano­ther unresolved issue. The statement makes no reference to dollar-denominated transactions. In practice, this suggests that the tariff threat is not linked to the use of the US financial system but to trade access itself. That distinction matters.
Over the past decade, Iran and its trading partners have increasingly relied on non-dollar mechanisms, including barter and local currencies, to bypass financial sanctions. Apparently, the new tariff tied to US bound exports would apply regardless of how Iran-related trade is settled, reducing the effectiveness of such workarounds but at the same time reinforcing incentives to diversify away from the US market.
Blanket tariff
What distinguishes this move from previous sanctions regimes is its breadth. Traditional secondary sanctions target specific entities, allowing governments to compartmentalise compliance. A blanket tariff applied at the country level removes that flexibility. Even minimal or symbolic trade with Iran could, in theory, trigger penalties on entirely unrelated exports to the US. This transforms sanctions from a targeted tool into a form of collective economic pressure.
For Iran, the likely impact is further economic contraction. The country is already grappling with inflation, unemployment and currency depreciation — conditions that have underpinned recent unrest. Reducing its remaining trade channels may deepen these pressures, with consequences felt most acutely by ordinary citizens rather than the Iranian state apparatus.
International reaction is still taking shape, but fault lines are already visible. China, Iran’s largest trading partner and principal buyer of its oil, has openly rejected what it describes as unilateral coercion. Compliance would come at a strategic and economic cost that Beijing appears unwilling to bear.
Other partners, including India, Turkiye and Gulf states, face more complex calculations, balancing exposure to the US market against regional and energy considerations. The European governments, long critical of extraterritorial US measures, are likely to view the move as another erosion of multilateral trade norms, even if their response remains muted.
For now, Islamabad appears to have settled on a strategy of watchful waiting. None of the relevant quarters were prepared to offer an on record assessment of the announcement, reflecting the sensitivity and uncertainty surrounding its possible implementation. Despite repeated requests for comment, officials remained circumspect, privately acknowledging the risks of premature positioning. As one senior officer put it bluntly, “why should we stick out our neck?”

The issue was raised in the House by PPP lawmakers Syed Naveed Qamar, Dr Sharmila Faruqui and others through a calling attention notice expressing alarm over diversion of resources from nationally strategic projects.
Slamming the Centre for breaching fiscal protocols and undermining provincial autonomy, questioning why a provincial motorway project was being “federalised”, Syed Naveed Qamar criticised the diversion of funds from key federal projects to the Motorway project.
“Such projects are dealt best at the provincial level,” he said. Chaudhry Armaghan Subhani, Minister of State for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives, in response said that no funds had been diverted from PSDP to the Lahore-Bahawalnagar Motorway project.
Mr Qamar, however, said it was best course that the government does not divert funds from any source. “And if at all you need to build infrastructure projects, they should come under public-private partnership mode as Sindh is doing. Why it can’t be done in Punjab,” he asked.

 

Another PPP leader Sharmila Faruqui accused the government of violating fiscal agreements by including the provincial project in the PSDP without provincial consent.
She expressed concern over the National Highway Authority’s Rs2.5 trillion “throw-forward,” calling the project’s federal funding a significant issue. “You cannot include a project in the PSDP unless the province agrees to 50 per cent funding,” she said.
State Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Chaudhry Armaghan Subhani also said that the government was giving top priority to the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project and it will be incorporated into the next Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
He said the project comprising five sections will be completed on a fast-track basis and noted that building motorways was the hallmark of the PML-N.
The National Assembly speaker referred the matter to the Planning and Development Panel for further review.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry informed the House that illegal call centres operating across the country were being targeted, pointing out that many had been set up in remote areas where there was no legitimate basis for such facilities to exist.
These centres, he claimed, were often linked to financial fraud and scams involving multiple nationalities and were contributing to the country’s negative image abroad.
Responding to another point of order raised by members of the House, Mr Chaudhry said the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) is facing capacity challenges, which had replaced the FIA’s cybercrime wing.
He said at present, only around 523 personnel were available in the country in the authority, whereas complaints of financial fraud, online harassment and other cyber offences were increasing rapidly.
He said the government was according full attention to strengthening the NCCI with experienced officers being posted and new recruitments initiated.
Former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaisar raised the issue of his bill seeking the right of appeal against verdicts of military courts and was assured by the chair the bill will be placed on agenda on the next private members’ day.

The federal minister is currently in Riyadh, leading a Pakistani delegation at the Future Minerals Forum (FMF) 2026, hosted by the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.







On the sidelines of the forum, the Saudi minister noted that global focus has increasingly shifted towards mining and critical minerals.
He highlighted the vast potential for Pakistan–Saudi cooperation in the minerals sector and assured that Saudi Arabia’s knowledge resources and technical expertise would be available to support Pakistan’s mineral sector.
Mauritius envoy
Separately, Mauritius High Commissioner Munsoo Kurrimbaccus underscored the need for collective efforts to restore the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) that previously existed between Pakistan and Mauritius, under which approximately 120 commodities enjoyed preferential market access.
He noted that the agreement became inactive due to various reasons and stressed that its revival could significantly boost bilateral trade.

WASHINGTON/DUBAI/DOHA: Iranian authorities will press charges punishable by death against some individuals arrested during recent demonstrations, prosecutors said on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting, saying help was on the way.
“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING — TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!… HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding he had cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials until the “senseless killing” of protesters stopped.







But when asked to expand on his message to protesting Iranians, he said: “You’re going to have to figure that one out. I’m sorry.”
Following the US president’s post, Iranian security chief Ali Larijani said on social media platform X that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were the “main killers” of the Iranian people.







The message came hours after Trump slapped 25pc import tariffs on products from any country doing business with Iran — a major oil exporter.
The move triggered movement in global markets, with oil prices surging by about 3pc on Tuesday as the prospect of disruptions to Iranian crude exports overshadowed possible increased supply from Venezuela.
While foreign monitors continued to speculate on the number of casualties from the crackdown on recent anti-government protests, Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying that around 2,000 people had been killed.
The official blamed “terrorists” for the deaths of both protesters and security personnel, but did not give a breakdown.
Iran’s authorities have tried to take a dual approach to the demonstrations, calling protests over economic problems legitimate while enforcing a harsh security crackdown.
The office of the Tehran prosecutor said in a statement quoted by state television that an unspecified number would be charged with “waging war against God”.
“The government sees security forces and protesters as its children. To the best of our abilities, we have tried and will try to listen to their voices even if some have tried to hijack such protests,” government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday.
Communications restrictions including an internet blackout over recent days have hampered the flow of information. The UN rights office said on Tuesday that phone services had been restored but internet links with Iran remained patchy.
Addressing the blackout, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera: “The government was in dialogue with the protesters. The internet was cut only after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country.”
Videos of nighttime clashes between demonstrators and security forces over the past week, including several that were verified by Reuters, have shown violent confrontations with gunfire and burning cars and buildings.
World wary
World leaders and capitals also weighed in on the tensions simmering in the Islamic Republic, as well as the confusion surrounding the protests and the possible fallout from Trump’s tariff imposition.
Qatar said Tuesday that a military escalation between the United States and Iran would have grave consequences for the region, while China vowed to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, in the context of President Trump’s punitive tariff announcement.
“We have always believed that there are no winners in a tariff war, and China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference when asked about Trump’s levy announcement.
Russia also condemned what it described as “subversive external interference” in Iran’s internal politics, saying any repeat of last year’s US strikes would have “disastrous consequences” for the Middle East and international security.
In a call with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani expressed Doha’s support on Tuesday for “all efforts aiming to de-escalate and peaceful solutions”.
The Qatari foreign ministry said the two men had discussed the latest regional developments, without directly mentioning ongoing protests that have convulsed Iran.
In addition, the UAE Minister of Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi said on Tuesday it is unclear how President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on countries trading with Iran will be implemented and whether it will impact food imports.
Sanctions
Saying that he was horrified by the mounting violence against protesters, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged Tehran to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters, and to restore full access to the internet and phone services.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also Brussels would “swiftly” propose new sanctions on Iran.
“The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying.
“I unequivocally condemn the excessive use of force and continued restriction of freedom,” she posted online.







Underscoring international uncertainty over what comes next in Iran, which has been one of the dominant powers across the Middle East for decades, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believed the government would fall.
But Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed Merz’s criticisms, accusing Berlin of double standards and saying he had “obliterated any shred of credibility”.
‘Royal family’
White House envoy Steve Witkoff over the weekend met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, to discuss the protests roiling that country, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified senior US official.
Meanwhile, the widow of the deposed shah of Iran has also called on Iranian security forces to support protests.
Farah Pahlavi, 87, echoing calls made by her son the former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, said she believed “light will triumph over darkness” despite a crackdown by authorities that activists fear has left hundreds dead.
She left Iran on January 16, 1979 alongside her husband Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, just two weeks before the return to the country of Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Her husband died in 1980.
Farah Pahlavi had on January 2 welcomed the protests as “filling my heart with pride”, but this is her first statement since they grew into large-scale demonstrations last week calling for an end to the Islamic republic.
Farah Pahlavi was the third wife of the shah, who she met while a student in Paris.

Protesters alleged that thousands of fruit and non-fruit trees had dried up and crops over thousands of acres of agricultural land were damaged due to water shortages. A large number of local residents staged an indefinite sit-in at Nasirabad, blocking the KKH.
They said Nasirabad valley has been facing a shortage of water, particularly during the summer season, for a long time. The local population depends on agriculture and fruit trees as their main source of income. Last year, acute water shortages severely affected crops and fruit orchards.
According to the protesters, a water supply scheme from Minapin to Nasirabad in Hunza was approved 15 years ago to address the issue. However, they alleged that despite the passage of 15 years, the pipeline-based water supply scheme has not been completed.
Baba Jan, a leader of the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Workers Party and a resident of the area, said the livelihoods of local people have suffered for many years. “Fruit trees, including blackberry, cherry, apricot and other unique varieties in the valley, have dried up. Crops, which are the backbone of the local economy, were badly damaged last year due to the unavailability of irrigation water,” he said.
He added that the water supply scheme, initiated 15 years ago, had completed about 90 per cent of its work, but was later revised. The revised project requires approval from a Gilgit-Baltistan CWP meeting; however, for the past three years, it has not been included in the meeting’s agenda.

 

Another protester, Wajid Baig, said local residents were also facing difficulties in accessing water for drinking and daily use. Protesters pointed out that while the GB government claims to promote plantation and the billion tree project, agricultural land and thousands of trees grown by local people are suffering due to water shortages.
They said they had repeatedly met officials and requested intervention, but no action was taken. The protesters staged the sit-in on the KKH despite temperatu­res dropping to minus eight degrees Celsius. Traffic remai­ned suspen­ded for several hours; however, in the evening, the road was ope­ned for an hour to allow stranded tou­rists and emergency vehicles to pass.
The protesters warned that if practical work on the project does not start this year, half of the village could be completely destro­y­­ed agriculturally, further worsening the local economy and living conditions. They appealed to the caretaker chief minister to take immediate notice of the situation and direct the relevant departme­nts to start work on the water supply project on an emergency basis.
They said the sit-in would conti­nue until a notification is issued to begin work on the water project.

“The federal government has allowed potato and kinno exports following the chief minister’s special efforts,” the provincial government said in a statement.
The move follows calls from Punjab’s potato growers for urgent government support, including subsidised exports, after a production surplus coincided with weak domestic demand and shrinking export prospects.
Farmers had blamed months-long disruption in trade through the Afghanistan border for a sharp decline in potato prices, saying rates had fallen below production costs in parts of Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, Kasur and adjoining districts. Some growers, they said, had ploughed standing crops back into the soil to avoid further losses.
In a statement, CM Maryam Nawaz said the hard work of potato and kinno farmers would not be allowed to go to waste.

Move comes after CM Maryam intervenes on growers’ complaints

“I remain in contact with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to help farmers overcome their difficulties,” she said, adding that the Punjab government had approached the Centre for the formation of a high-level committee to facilitate exports of kinno and potatoes.
She said the committee, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, would include representatives of relevant ministries and key stakeholders to address the issue in a coordinated manner.
The chief minister said the province had also urged the Centre to explore new international markets and reduce export-related costs to ease difficulties faced by exporters and farmers.
“Practical measures are being taken on a daily basis to resolve issues related to kinno and potato exports and to maximise foreign exchange earnings,” she said.
She said Punjab produced about 95 per cent of the country’s potatoes and kinno.
She added that potato output in the province was expected to reach about 12 million tonnes this year, while kinno production was projected at four million tonnes.

At a time when there is no indication that the border with Afghanistan will reopen soon, importers engaged in Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) have requested that the Ministry of Commerce grant a one-time waiver for the re-export of over 6,500 containers stuck at Karachi ports, as they are incurring rising demurrage charges.
The need for re-export arose after the border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan was closed on Oct 11, 2025 leading to a near-complete halt of bilateral trade and movement of transit cargo.
Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). After successive rounds, Pakistan declared the talks effectively over on Nov 7, after which Afghanistan suspended trade ties. Pakistan had already closed its border following the October clashes.

Over 6,500 containers stuck at Karachi ports since closure of Pak-Afghan border in October

“Yes, we have issued letters to individual importers who are approaching the ministry to re-export their cargo,” an official at the Ministry of Commerce told Dawn on Tuesday. The official added that the commerce minister had the power to grant a one-time exemption.
Interestingly, the commerce ministry has not officially announced the decision but has begun issuing letters to intended importers who approached the ministry for re-export permission.
The largest number of stranded containers — approximately 3,000 — originates from Malaysia and contains palm oil intended for edible use in Afghanistan. “We have already issued letters to most palm oil importers to re-export their containers,” the official said. But he declined to specify the exact number of palm oil containers approved for re-export.
Re-export is subject to approval from the Ministry of Commerce on a case-by-case basis.
A customs official told Dawn that the number of containers stranded at the Chaman and Torkham borders was not big, ranging between 600 and 700.
Instead, the bulk of transit cargo was stuck at the two ports in Karachi.
Envoys’ plea to Islamabad
The cargos, sourced mostly from China and Vietnam, are currently stranded at Karachi, the official said. He added that the ambassadors of these countries had approached the government to seek approval for re-export.
Following these consultations, the government has decided to allow all importers to re-export their cargo from Karachi.
This move offers Afghan importers an opportunity to use alternative ports or routes to transport their goods to the Afghan market.
This decision, according to the official, will allow importers to use other ports for the transportation of their goods to Afghanistan.
On Dec 3, Islamabad allowed clearing of consignments imported on humanitarian grounds. In the first phase, 143 containers carrying such goods were given permission for transit at Chaman and Torkham.
A breakdown shows that 67 of the containers carried assistance from the World Food Programme, 74 were loaded with supplies for children donated by Unicef, and two containers had healthcare and family support items from another UN agency.
According to the customs official, since the Taliban government has barred the entry of these containers, none had crossed the border for the past three months.
The volume of Afghan imports transiting through Pakistan has declined sharply over the past two years falling to $2.4 billion in FY24 from $6.7bn in FY23, and dropping further to $1.01bn in FY25.
With the current suspension of trade, industry estimates suggest the figure could slip below the $1bn mark during the current fiscal, deepening the shift in Afghanistan’s import routes and suppliers.

Malik made executive committee chairman
ISLAMABAD: On the second day of its meeting, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) recommended the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Sindh High Court (SHC) out of a total list of 12, by a majority of its total membership.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakis­tan Yahya Afridi, the JCP, after due consideration of the relevant data forms, ant­ecedents and evaluation material placed before it, confirmed Justice Miran Muha­mmad Shah, Justice Ms Tasneem Sultana, Justice Riazat Ali Sahar, Justice Muham­mad Hassan (Akber), Justice Abdul Ham­id Bhurgi, Justice Jan Ali Junejo, Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Justice Muhammad Jaffer Raza as permanent judges of the SHC.
Meanwhile, the JCP also recommended the extension of two additional judges for another six months, namely Justice Khalid Hussain Shahani and Justice Syed Fiazul Hassan Shah.
The meeting was held at the conference room of the Supreme Court to make recommendations for the confirmation of additional judges as judges of the SHC, as well as for the reconstitution and extension of constitutional benches.
Similarly, the commission, by a majority vote, also nominated four judges to the constitutional bench of the SHC, besides extending the tenure of the constitutional benches by six months. The nominated judges are Justice Amjad Ali Bohio, Justice Muhammad Hassan (Akber), Justice Ali Haider ‘Ada’ and Justice Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi.
On Wednesday, the JCP will consider the confirmation of 10 additional judges of the Peshawar High Court.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, the 248th meeting of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) elected Pir Muham­mad Masood Chishti as the new vice chairman of the PBC for the year 2026 by a majority vote.
Presided over by Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, who is also the chairman of the PBC, the meeting was held at the council’s office in the Supreme Court building and transacted a number of items on the agenda.

 

While acting as the Returning Officer for the election, the AGP invited proposals for the post of vice chairman. In response, Farooq Hamid Naek proposed the name of Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti from Lahore, which was seconded by Syed Qalb-i-Hassan. On the other hand, Muhammad Maqsood Buttar proposed the name of Qazi Muhammad Arshad from Abbottabad as the other candidate.
Both Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti and Qazi Muhammad Arshad consented to the proposals of their respective candidature. As there was a contest, the election was held through a secret ballot. After the completion of the polling process, the ballot papers were taken out of the ballot box, counted and found to be 23 in number.
As per the count of the ballot papers, Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti secured 15 votes, while Qazi Muhammad Arshad obtained eight votes. Resultantly, the Returning Officer declared Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti as the elected vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council for the year 2026.
The council also elected Muneer A. Ma­­l­­ik from Karachi as the chairman of the PBC executive committee for the year 2026.
Meanwhile, the PBC strongly condem­n­­ed the campaign of character assassinati­­on against judges of the Lahore High Cou­rt and the Islamabad High Court on baseless allegations, terming it an attack on the prestige and dignity of the judiciary.
The council reiterated that the legal fraternity would never allow anyone to succeed in nefarious designs aimed at targeting judges.

Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are expected to drop by about Rs4.50 per litre and Rs2.75 per litre, respectively (over 1pc), depending on final calculations.
The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Rs1.8 (1pc) and Rs2 per litre (1.4pc), respectively. The kerosene rate and LDO rates currently stand at Rs177.88 and Rs146.18 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price set by the government currently stands at Rs253.17 per litre, but is sold at more than Rs254.40 per litre at retail stations. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and has a direct bearing on the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-class households.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs257.08 per litre, which may drop to around Rs254 per litre on Jan 15. The retailers are selling the product at a higher price of Rs258 per litre.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary, as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines such as trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells, and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares on the basis of about Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, and have not reversed despite the Rs17 and Rs20 per litre cut since October 1. The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs97 per litre on diesel.

“Both enactments stand on firm constitutional footing, not in conflict but in constitutional harmony, each valid in its own aspect,” observed Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a two-judge FCC bench that dismissed a challenge filed by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd against amendments introduced by the Balochistan government to a federal excise law.
In its 15-page verdict, the court explained that while the imposition of excise duty squarely falls within federal legislative competence, the advancement of labour welfare, when viewed from the perspective of public interest, lies well within the provincial domain.
The controversy at hand revolved around a petition instituted by Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd, an entity engaged in the production and sale of cement, with its manufacturing facility located at Hub, Lasbela, Balochistan. The petition challenged a Nov 27, 2023 order of the Balochistan High Court.

Attock Cement’s challenge to BHC verdict dismissed

The petition was initially filed before the Supreme Court but was later transferred to the newly established FCC following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
On Jan 15, 2021, the factory was served with a notice by the Mines Labour Welfare Department, Balochistan, requiring payment of excise duty on minerals to the Labour Welfare Commissioner, Balochistan, at rates revised pursuant to the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020.
In response, the factory submitted three separate representations to the department, seeking revision of the applicable rates. However, all three representations were declined.
During the hearing before the FCC, counsel for the factory, Khurram M. Hashmi and Noman A. Farooqi, argued that the provincial assembly, by amending Section 3 of the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour Welfare) Act, 1967 through Section 7 of the Balochistan Finance Act, 2020, had acted without legislative competence. They contended that the imposition of excise duty fell within the exclusive federal legislative domain and that the Balochistan Assembly therefore lacked the authority to amend the 1967 Act, particularly where such amendment effectively altered the rate or nature of excise duty.
However, in the judgement, Justice Farooq observed that the objective of the Labour Welfare Act, 1967 was unmistakably oriented towards the advancement of labour welfare, a domain constitutionally entrusted to the provinces.
The mechanism through which this objective is pursued — the imposition of a duty of excise — is not an end in itself but a means carefully designed to finance a broader public interest. The statute, the judgment noted, does not merely levy a tax; rather, it establishes an administrative framework for the collection, allocation and utilisation of the proceeds, all of which are inextricably linked to the welfare of labour employed in the industry.
Thus, while the recovery of excise duty constitutes the operative mechanism of the Act, its spirit, essential character and constitutional essence lie in the realisation of labour welfare. The excise duty, the court held, is instrumental in achieving this predominant provincial objective, rendering the Act, in its true nature, an expression of social welfare legislation rather than mere taxation.
Even if, by a strict reading of the preamble and operative provisions of the 1967 Act, its dominant character were to be construed as the collection and imposition of excise duty, its underlying purpose could not be ignored. Such a conclusion, the court said, merely reveals an overlap between two constitutional competences: the federal authority to levy excise duty and the provincial responsibility to advance labour welfare.
This incidental overlap, the judgment added, does not justify invalidating the statute. Justice Farooq emphasised that the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) of 2010 consciously embraced the ethos of cooperative federalism, wherein legislative fields are not rigid silos but, at times, interacting spheres.
In this constitutional landscape, incidental overlap does not render a statute ultra vires. The court further observed that following the 18th Amendment, the Concur­rent Legislative List was abolished, significantly expanding provincial legislative authority, with matters not explicitly listed in the Federal Legislative List falling within the exclusive domain of the provinces.
The FCC also acknowledged the traditional use of the “pith and substance” doctrine in determining legislative competence, noting that courts have increasingly relied on the “double aspect” doctrine, which permits a single subject to be legislated upon by both federal and provincial governments from different perspectives. 
In the end, the FCC denied leave to appeal and dismissed the petition filed by the cement manufacturer.

In a post on X, the Presidency said President Zardari was received by Bahrain National Guard Commander Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa and Foreign Minister Sheikh Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani upon their arrival.
The video shared with the post showed that First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari was also accompanying the president.







State broadcaster PTV said on X that in addition to meeting Bahrain’s king and crown prince, President Zardari will also address a reception held at the headquarters of the Economic Development Board in Manama.







Shortly after arriving, President Zardari met with the commander of Bahrain’s National Guard.







The Foreign Office said earlier this week that during the visit, the president will hold meetings with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who is also the prime minister.
“The discussions will focus on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,” the FO said.
“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” it added.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Earlier in September, Bahrain’s interior minister had visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-13 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/132211357504655.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966764/4-terrorists-killed-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-kalat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists killed in intelligence-based operation in Kalat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan‘s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on January 12 (Monday) security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, it said, adding that four terrorists were killed after an “intense fire exchange”.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the statement added.
It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It added that the counterterrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces on the operation.
In his statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, PM Shehbaz said security forces were achieving notable successes in their fight against terrorism under Azm-e-Istehkam.
“The whole nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism,“ he said, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country.







Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In a press conference last week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.
Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.</p><small>2026-01-13 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13205212400858d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966763/imrans-sisters-pti-workers-stage-sit-in-near-pindis-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sisters, PTI workers stage sit-in near Pindi’s Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters and party workers staged a sit-in at Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka on Tuesday after they were again barred from meeting the former prime minister.
Sit-ins at Factory Naka — which is a short distance away from the Adiala jail — on Tuesdays and Thursdays by PTI workers and supporters, as well as Imran’s sisters, have become a usual occurrence as they continue to be restricted from meeting the ex-premier for the past several weeks.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24, 2025 mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran.
Routes to the Adiala jail were blocked on Tuesday, including at Factory Naka and Dahgal Naka, amid a large police presence.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan was stopped at Dahgal Naka while several others, including Imran’s sisters, were barred from moving beyond Factory Naka.
Similarly, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja posted on social media platform X at around 3pm that he had been stopped at a police checkpoint right after he crossed Bahria Town.







Later, in a video shared by the PTI on X around 8pm, he detailed that he was also stopped at Chakri. “I was again stopped around two to three miles away from Chakri, now we have finally reached here (near the Adiala jail),” he added.







In a video posted on X by the PTI, Aleema said, “We had to recite and finish the Quran here, but they are afraid of it … what kind of people are they? They have strictly blocked all the routes to Adiala.”
On Monday, Aleema had called on PTI supporters to come to Adiala jail for Khatam-i-Quran.







“We will sit here,” she asserted, adding that “the oppressors are afraid”.
“Why have they arrested him (Imran)? Why are they denying meetings with him? Why is he kept in solitary confinement?“ she asked.
Aleema said that last week, jail authorities had stated that a meeting would be arranged, which is why the party wrapped up its sit-in.
“They do this every time,” she said. “We have told Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Achakzai about this; however, they insisted on giving them a chance.”
Meanwhile, those at the sit-in at Factory Naka shouted slogans in favour of Imran as the route to Adiala jail from that spot remained completely blocked.







Earlier in the day, Aleema asserted while speaking to the media that “we will do whatever needs to be done” for Imran’s release. She also called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi “the future of Pakistan”, adding that the “youth in Pakistan have buried the old politics”.
“This is new politics,” she said. On the PTI founder’s messages from jail, she said “whatever messages he sends” were posted on X.
Imran does not have access to the internet in jail, and it remains unclear who operates his X account. However, it has had posts described as his messages from jail following his meetings with his family and other associates.</p><small>2026-01-13 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13201102afca4a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966758/wwf-pakistan-says-removal-of-trees-in-islamabad-also-linked-to-infrastructure-development' target='_blank'><strong>WWF-Pakistan says removal of trees in Islamabad also linked to infrastructure development</strong></a><br><p>WWF-Pakistan on Tuesday disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed in the capital for causing allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development.
Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in the federal capital, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. Islamabad’s Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies, and earlier on Tuesday Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry assured lawmakers that more trees would be planted in the coming months.
“WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body said on social media.
“Beyond pollen and allergies, Islamabad’s recent tree removal reflects broader challenges in urban planning,” it added.
Social media users and even some lawmakers have alleged that, besides paper mulberry, old indigenous trees were also chopped down.
Responding to those queries in the National Assembly on Tuesday, Chaudhry explained there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered as green areas until they were built.
“I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted, about the claims of other species besides the paper mulberry being cut.
In its Facebook post, WWF-Pakistan noted: “Urban trees play a critical role in soil stability, climate regulation, and biodiversity support.
“Any tree removal must follow evidence-based planning, legal compliance, and clear restoration commitments to ensure long-term ecological balance,” it demanded.

 

The environmental organisation also shared a report that consolidated findings from its “field inspections on tree-cutting and land-clearing activities in Islamabad with key policy, health, and ecological considerations related to the ongoing removal of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) and cutting of trees for [sic] construction of infrastructure”.
“Between December 2025 and January 2026, extensive tree cutting and land clearing activities were widely reported through social and formal media across multiple locations in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), including Shakarparian, Lok Virsa, the National Museum precinct, the Islamabad Expressway (H-8), and the Margalla Enclave Link Road near the National Institutes of Health (NIH),” WWF-Pakistan stated.

It added that “several” of these activities were associated with “major infrastructure development works, including road construction and monument-related projects, resulting in large-scale clearance of trees and natural vegetation”.
Subsequently, WWF-Pakistan carried out field verification to “assess the nature, scale, and underlying drivers of these activities, and to distinguish between vegetation removal linked to infrastructure development and that undertaken for public-health purposes”.
The report noted that paper mulberry has been identified by environmental and medical experts as a “major contributor to seasonal pollen allergies in Islamabad, causing allergic rhinitis, asthma, and related respiratory issues”.
“Under directives from the Prime Minister’s Office and public health authorities, CDA launched a structured programme to systematically remove this species from parks, greenbelts and public spaces,” it recalled.

 

WWF-Pakistan found: “Overall, field evidence and available documentation indicate that while a significant portion of tree removal across Islamabad is associated with the paper mulberry eradication programme driven by public-health considerations, substantial vegetation loss has also resulted from infrastructure development, particularly along the H-8 Islamabad Expressway (proposed monument site) and the Margalla Enclave Link Road.
“At the H-8 site alone, infrastructure-related land clearing has resulted in an estimated net loss of approximately five hectares of urban tree and vegetation cover.”
While noting that reforestation and compensatory plantation efforts were reportedly underway at several locations, the report said their “visibility, consistency, and ecological design, especially at infrastructure sites, remain unclear”.
“The long-term ecological success of these interventions will therefore depend on transparent decision-making, clear and site-specific restoration planning, prioritisation of native species, and independent monitoring to ensure that Islamabad’s green character and ecological integrity are effectively safeguarded,” it concluded.
As per the report, “official sources” indicated that more than 29,000 paper mulberry trees have been removed city-wide, including from Shakarparian, Fatima Jinnah Park (F-9), and greenbelts along Park Road and the H-8 Expressway.
Paper mulberry a ‘highly invasive species’
In a separate research paper dated Monday, WWF-Pakistan Forest Director Muhammad Ibrahim Khan proposed a “science-based strategy for gradual removal and replacement of paper mulberry” in ICT.
Citing various previous research, the official noted that paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) was a “non-native, highly invasive species in Islamabad and Rawalpindi that has aggressively colonised natural vegetation pockets, from the Margalla foothills and associated nullahs to urban and peri-urban sectors”.

He not only acknowledged the species’ “well-documented role” in pollen allergies, but also pointed out that it “suppresses native tree regeneration, ground flora and associated wildlife habitats through rapid growth, dense canopy formation, and allelopathic effects”.
The paper further said that paper mulberry’s complete eradication was “ecologically impractical and technically unrealistic” due to its regeneration abilities.

 

Expressing ecological concerns, the paper stated: “Sudden, large-scale removal, especially uprooting, risks soil disturbance, erosion, loss of understorey vegetation, and displacement of urban wildlife.
“Indiscriminate felling may also unintentionally remove native species and mixed natural growth, further degrading ecological integrity and ecosystem services.”
The WWF-Pakistan official called for all activities to be guided by “site-specific ecological assessments and legally compliant Environmental Impact Assessments where applicable”.
“Public disclosure of species removed, species planted, and survival outcomes is essential to maintain transparency and public trust,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-13 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13145649b0c5406.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966740/pti-formally-nominates-mehmood-khan-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader' target='_blank'><strong>PTI formally nominates Mehmood Khan Achakzai as NA opposition leader</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday formally requested the appointment of Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the National Assembly (NA) opposition leader.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed the submission of Achakzai’s nomination papers to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. This is the second time that the party has formally proposed his name for the opposition leader’s post in the lower house of Parliament.
The development comes a day after Sadiq began afresh the process for the appointment of the opposition leader — a slot that has been lying vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August 2025.
Addressing the NA speaker, the written proposal for Achakzai’s nomination — seen by Dawn and dated January 12 — stated: “We, the undersigned members of the National Assembly belonging to the opposition benches, have the honour to nominate Mehmood Khan Achakzai MNA (NA-266) for appointment as the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan.”
It referred to rule 39 of the Rules of Procedures of Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, saying that the “leader of the opposition is to be appointed from among the members of the house who belong to the opposition and who commands the confidence of the majority of the members sitting on the opposition benches”.
“In view of the foregoing, we hereby affirm that Mehmood Khan Achakzai enjoys the confidence and support of the majority of the members belonging to the opposition, and is, therefore, the most suitable person to hold this constitutional office.
“The timely appointment of the leader of the opposition will ensure the effective discharge of constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities entrusted to the opposition,” it read.
The document added: “We therefore request that, after following necessary procedures for the appointment of the leader of the opposition in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and the previous parliamentary practices, MNA Mehmood Khan Achakzai may please be appointed as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan at the earliest.”
Separately, Barrister Gohar confirmed while speaking to Geo News in Parliament that Achakzai’s nomination papers had been submitted.
The PTI chairman said he was expecting that the PkMAP leader would be notified as the new leader of the opposition in the NA on Thursday.
In response to a question, he said his party had just one nominee for the vacant slot — Achakzai — and only his nomination papers had been submitted.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had named Achakzai for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA in August last year, nearly two weeks after the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified him following his conviction in cases pertaining to riots on May 9, 2023.
The opposition had also submitted the nomination papers for Achakzai — who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025.
Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
But the submission in October was made to the speaker’s office rather than to him personally.
The opposition has also repe­atedly accused the government of delaying Achakzai’s appointment, while the NA speaker had maintained until recently that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
Ayub had filed pleas in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal but later withdrew the petitions.
Subsequently, the NA Secretariat sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar in December, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing was necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Dogar submitted the required documents to the NA speaker on January 5, following which the latter had said that the constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader would be initiated afresh in the next parliamentary session.
During Monday’s NA session, the speaker formally initiated the process for the appointment of the NA opposition leader by seeking proposals for the nomination.</p><small>2026-01-13 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13181313283da76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966755/pakistan-at-important-stage-in-shaping-its-digital-asset-ecosystem-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan at important stage in shaping its digital asset ecosystem: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Tuesday that Pakistan was at an early but important stage in shaping its digital asset ecosystem.
He expressed the views during a meeting with a visiting delegation from Icoin Technology Inc, a Silicon Valley-based blockchain infrastructure company. The delegation was led by the company’s Chief Executive Officer Chet Silvestri, the finance ministry said in a press release.







According to the press release, the minister said Pakistan was at an early but important stage in shaping its digital asset ecosystem and welcomed knowledge-sharing and responsible investment aligned with national priorities.
During the meeting, Aurangzeb briefed the delegation on Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to develop a “structured and responsible” framework for digital assets and apprised it of the progress made toward the establishment of a Pakistan Crypto Council and the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA)
“The minister highlighted Pakistan’s growing participation in global digital asset activity, as reflected in international analytics and emphasised the government’s resolve to channel this activity into a well-regulated environment that safeguards users while encouraging innovation and investment,” the statement said.
It further stated that the finance minister underscored that regulation was essential to balance opportunity with risk, particularly in light of increasing volumes of digital asset usage by Pakistani citizens.
The finance minister noted that the “evolving policy framework aims to provide clarity to market participants, align with international best practices and ensure coordination among regulators, including the central bank, to enable orderly market development and institutional participation”.
Meanwhile, Silvestri shared insights from the US and Canadian markets, drawing on Icoin Technology’s experience of working with banks, exchanges, and large-scale consumer platforms, the statement said.
He outlined how regulatory clarity in mature markets had enabled traditional financial institutions to engage with digital assets through existing infrastructure, rather than reinventing core banking systems.
According to the statement, he also explained the role of wallet-based middleware and switching technologies that allow banks to connect securely with exchanges, manage liquidity, enhance compliance, and offer digital asset services to customers through familiar banking applications.
“The delegation highlighted the transformational potential of blockchain technology and stable coins in modernising financial infrastructure by enabling faster, lower-cost and more transparent transactions, while maintaining regulatory oversight,” it said.
Reference was made to recent legislative developments in the United States aimed at bringing coherence to digital asset regulation, particularly in relation to stablecoins and the integration of digital assets within the banking system, it added.
The statement said the delegation emphasised that young and tech-savvy populations across markets were already engaging with digital assets and that regulated participation through banks helps retain activity within the formal financial system.
“The finance minister advised that, given the evolving nature of the regulatory landscape, initial engagement with interested banks and relevant institutions would be a constructive next step, alongside continued dialogue with regulators, including the State Bank of Pakistan,” it added.
Discussions also covered Icoin Technology’s global engagements, including partnerships enabling large consumer bases to access digital asset services, and the company’s interest in exploring opportunities in Pakistan in collaboration with local partners, the finance ministry said.
The delegation also sought guidance on appropriate regulatory pathways, licensing requirements and engagement mechanisms with relevant authorities, including banks and regulators, it added.
Both sides agreed to maintain engagement, explore areas of cooperation, and continue exchanges aimed at supporting Pakistan’s efforts to build a transparent, inclusive, and well-regulated digital asset market.

 

In the recent past, the regulation of Pakistan‘s digital asset market has been on the government’s agenda, as evident from the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
President Zardari promulgated the Pakistan Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025 on July 8 last year, with the stated objective of licensing, regulating and supervising virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.
Pakistan has since set up PVARA to regulate virtual-asset and blockchain-related activities.

Pakistan’s Polio Eradication Programme said in a statement that the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, had confirmed a case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in North Waziristan.
“This is the fifth case reported from North Waziristan in 2025, bringing the total number of polio cases in Pakistan for the past year to 31,” it said.
Meanwhile, an official from the lab said that the case was included in the list for 2025 as the sample was collected last year.
“It takes up to three weeks to confirm that a child has been affected. There are some more samples in the lab which are being analysed and, in case of confirmation, the tally for 2025 may further increase,” he said.
He added that wild poliovirus was detected in a four-month-old girl from Union Council Spinwam-2 in North Waziristan.
“The onset of symptoms began in December and subsequent samples collected from her were positive for WPV1. Therefore, this is the 31st case of 2025,” he said.
“Last year, Pakistan reported 20 cases from KP, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” he added.
In a statement issued last month, the country’s polio eradication programme noted that the overall trend showed a decline in positive detections of poliovirus compared to 2024 but circulation persisted in certain high-risk areas.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2026-01-13 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13191400a7c47a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966759/anti-minority-hate-speech-in-india-rose-by-13pc-in-2025-us-research-group-says' target='_blank'><strong>Anti-minority hate speech in India rose by 13pc in 2025, US research group says</strong></a><br><p>Hate speech against minorities, including Muslims and Christians, in India rose by 13 per cent in 2025, with most incidents occurring in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Washington-based research group said on Tuesday.
India Hate Lab documented 1,318 instances of what it called hate speech in 2025, up from 1,165 in 2024 and 668 in 2023, at events such as political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings.
Of that number, 1,164 incidents occurred in states and union territories governed by the BJP, either directly or with coalition political parties, the group said.
The Indian embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Modi and his party deny being discriminatory and say their policies, including food subsidy programs and electrification drives, benefit all communities.
April recorded the highest monthly spike, 158 events, with nearly 100 occurring between April 22, after a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, and May 7, when which sparked a conflict between Pakistan and India.
Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say abuse of minorities has risen in India since Modi took office in 2014, pointing to a religion-based citizenship law the UN calls “fundamentally discriminatory,” anti-conversion legislation that challenges freedom of belief, the 2019 removal of occupied Kashmir’s special status, and the demolition of Muslim-owned properties.
India Hate Lab, founded by US-based Kashmiri journalist Raqib Hameed Naik, is a project of the Centre for the Study of Organized Hate, a nonprofit Washington-based think tank.
The BJP has previously said India Hate Lab presents a biased picture of India.
India Hate Lab says it uses the UN’s definition of hate speech, which defines it as prejudiced or discriminatory language towards an individual or group based on attributes including religion, ethnicity, nationality, race or gender.</p><small>2026-01-13 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13101442fdaa0b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966724/trump-says-nations-doing-business-with-iran-face-25pc-tariff-on-us-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says nations doing business with Iran face 25pc tariff on US trade</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, ramping up pressure as a crackdown on protests continues.
Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners who also do business with the United States.
“This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying who they will affect.







Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to economic database Trading Economics.
Trump has been mulling his options on Iran, which has been roiled by more than two weeks of demonstrations that have defied a near-total internet blackout and lethal force.
Sparked by economic grievances, the nationwide protests have grown into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah.
Iranian authorities have blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest and staged their own nationwide counter-rallies.

Rights groups warned that the severed communications were aimed at masking a rising death toll.
The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the internet shutdown has made it “extremely difficult to independently verify reports” of casualties.
“The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.
The White House said on Monday that Trump remained “unafraid” to deploy military force against Iran, but was pursuing diplomacy as a first resort.
US asks its citizens to leave Iran
The State Department asked US-Iranian dual nationals to “exit Iran on Iranian passports”.
“The Iranian government does not recognise dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens,” the advisory said, adding that US nationals face “significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran”.







“Showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone,” added the State Department.
“The US government cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to depart using the following options. You should leave only if you believe it is safe to do so.”
China opposes Trump’s tariff threat
China said late on Monday that it opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction” after Trump announced the 25pc tariff on US trade.
“China’s position against the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems,” a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Washington said on X.
“China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”







‘Four-front war’
Iran on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated.
In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States.
“These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations.
In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”.
At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war”, listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the US and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” — a reference to the protests.
Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked.
But Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations.
Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS News the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that [it] is ready to negotiate once again”.
He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”.
“The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.”
‘Respect for their rights’
State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies.
The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed.
The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations.
The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises.
French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”.
Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.</p><small>2026-01-13 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/131729121767f6b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966746/pti-violated-commitments-made-in-preparation-for-kp-cms-sindh-visit-says-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>PTI violated commitments made in preparation for KP CM’s Sindh visit, says Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon on Tuesday assailed the PTI for not honouring commitments made in preparation for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s recent Sindh visit.
Memon’s comments come a day after the KP CM concluded his visit to the province. On Monday, the chief minister decried the treatment of him and his entourage in Karachi, saying that the provincial government had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Memon expressed his view that the PTI “did not care for the respect they had been accorded during the visit”.
“We do not care about their speeches; however, violations were committed, and all they did was blame the Sindh government.”
Addressing the events that transpired during the KP CM’s visit, Memon said that the Sindh government was in contact with representatives from the KP government, and the two had “chalked out” the schedule for the visit.



Memon maintained that the PTI “violated every commitment they made earlier”.
“There was a threat alert issued as well by security institutions; we did not disclose it to the public; however, the KP government was informed,” the minister said.
He said that, keeping in view the security situation, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah assured the delegation of protection and facilities, but he urged them “not to engage in anything that disrupts daily life and puts the safety of the delegation at risk”.
Memon recalled: “The first day, they were informed by Nasir Shah sahib to stay clear of certain areas, considering the threat, yet in the evening, they were seen in the District South“.
The Sindh minister further told the media, “Security plans are pre-decided before any such events […] to prevent any unfortunate incidents”.
“When they went to Hyderabad, they took an unapproved route on their way back to Karachi,” he added, contrary to Afridi’s claims of his convoy being forced to take such a route due to roadblocks.
The minister detailed that the PTI delegation took the route of the Hyderabad Bridge, where Memon said the delegation “got stuck in traffic for a couple of hours”.
Nasir had also refuted Afridi’s claims, saying that police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”.

 

On Afridi’s planned meeting with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah, which the PTI said had been scheduled for January 12 but did not take place, Memon claimed that the KP CM House decided the meeting’s time by themselves, without consulting the other side.
However, as CM Murad had other important meetings already scheduled, it was conveyed to the KP CM House that Memon could meet wherever Afridi wished to “if there were any important issues to discuss”.
When asked about the PTI’s stance on the meeting being cancelled by the Sindh CM House, Memon said it was “full of lies”.
The minister also disputed the PTI’s claims that the gates of Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah had been locked despite the permission for the party to hold a rally.
Memon asserted that the ground did not even have gates in the first place. He added, “If there are police mobiles inside the ground, they are present there to provide security.”
The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. Finally, CM Afridi briefly addressed hundreds near Mazar-i-Quaid.
‘Attempt to recreate May 9 events’
Memon further alleged that a “very dangerous attempt was made to recreate the events of May 9, 2023 in Karachi”, mentioning the vandalism of media vehicles on January 11. He asserted that the provincial government and police displayed “patience” while dealing with the situation.







The minister recalled that in Hyderabad, the PTI began “criticising the Sindh government again and started name-calling”, apparently referring to CM Afridi’s comment about President Asif Ali Zardari.
“What do you think the Sindh government is going to gain if you get stuck in traffic for a few hours? What benefit will we get out of this teasing?” the minister questioned.
“If our behaviour had been similar to that of PTI in the past, we would not have welcomed them at all,“ Memon added.
“You (PTI) were planning to cause mischief […] we told them that ‘please only do what has already been approved’,” the senior minister said.
Memon said that the Sindh government gave PTI “full assurances and facilitated them”, but they took “unfair advantage” of it.
He further asserted that no “wheel-jamming“ will be allowed on February 8, when asked about the KP CM‘s reported remarks to “bring the entire country to a halt” as part of the PTI’s protest plan.</p><small>2026-01-13 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/131655100ad2cf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750/in-meeting-with-icc-bangladesh-reiterates-its-refusal-to-travel-to-india-for-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with ICC, Bangladesh reiterates its refusal to travel to India for T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s cricket board said on Tuesday it had repeated its refusal to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup during talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC).
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
The World Cup begins on February 7, with Bangladesh scheduled to play their four group matches in India.
On Tuesday, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.
“The BCB reaffirmed its position regarding the decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns,” the board said in a statement.
“While the ICC highlighted that the tournament itinerary has already been announced and requested the BCB to reconsider its stance, the Board’s position remains unchanged.”
The ICC has not commented.
The BCB said discussions with the ICC continue to “explore possible solutions”, it added, but that it “remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff”.
Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are placed ninth in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.
Political ties between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-13 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1317052151f43b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966753/pia-partners-with-rail-services-in-canada-uk-in-bid-to-facilitate-passengers' target='_blank'><strong>PIA partners with rail services in Canada, UK in bid to facilitate passengers</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Tuesday that it had partnered with rail companies in Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) in a bid to facilitate its passengers.
In a press release, the national flag carrier’s spokesperson said that for the convenience of its passengers travelling to Toronto and destinations in the UK, special arrangements had been made to provide access to rail facilities.
“PIA has launched an ‘air-to-rail’ partnership with renowned rail services in Canada and the UK, providing passengers with extensive travel facilities,” he said.
Under the agreement, PIA passengers can now, after their air travel, reach their final destination by train on a single ticket without the hassle of booking separately, he said.
“PIA passengers will now be able to book their rail tickets along with air tickets to reach their final destination via rail, saving time and effort in booking trains separately,” he added.
“Passengers arriving in Toronto on PIA can connect to eight major cities in Canada through the airline’s partner rail service,” he said.
Similarly, passengers travelling to London and Manchester can access over 50 cities across the UK by train, he added.
“The booking process has been made easy and convenient for passengers who can also book their rail tickets for their destination through PIA’s booking offices, PIA registered travel agents, [the] airline’s official website, and mobile app,” the spokesperson added.</p><small>2026-01-13 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1316465973d238a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966752/public-private-schools-across-sindh-to-remain-closed-on-jan-17-on-account-of-shab-i-meraj' target='_blank'><strong>Public, private schools across Sindh to remain closed on Jan 17 on account of Shab-i-Meraj</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Tuesday announced that all public and private educational institutions will remain closed on January 17 (Saturday) on account of Shab-i-Meraj.
Shab-i-Meraj is observed on the 27th of Rajab to commemorate the Holy Prophet’s (Peace Be Upon Him) Night of Ascent.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “In pursuance of the decision taken in the sub-committee meeting of the Steering Committee on Education held on November 28, 2024, all public and private educational institutions under the administrative control of Sindh School Education and Literacy Department, Government on Sindh, shall remain closed on Saturday, January 17 on account of Shab-i-Meraj.”
Earlier this week, the Sindh government had decided to change school opening timings across the province for a period of two weeks.
The decision was made after Education Minister Sardar Ali Shah consulted with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, keeping in view the intensity of the cold spell in various parts of the province.
Under the revised schedule, all government and private educational institutions across Sindh will open at 9am instead of their earlier timings. However, school dispersal timings will remain unchanged and will follow the existing timetable.</p><small>2026-01-13 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13163438c7201c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966751/consensus-on-matters-of-national-security-need-of-the-hour-dg-ispr-says' target='_blank'><strong>Consensus on matters of national security need of the hour, DG ISPR says</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has stated that unity and consensus on matters of national security and narrative is the need of the hour, Radio Pakistan reported on Tuesday.
According to the report, he made the remarks as a delegation of the National Paigham-i-Aman Committee (NPAC), led by its Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, met with the DG ISPR in Rawalpindi.
“Speaking on the occasion, the DG ISPR emphasised that unity and consensus on matters of national security and narrative were the need of the hour,” it said.

 

He said a comprehensive discussion was held on internal security challenges in the context of Fitna al Khawarij, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan, which further strengthened the shared stance of all stakeholders, it said.
“Reiterating Islamabad’s principled position on Kashmir and Gaza, DG ISPR said supporting oppressed peoples is Pakistan’s moral responsibility, ” it added.
He stressed that public awareness and a truth-based narrative were decisive tools in countering the enemy’s psychological warfare, the report said.
Terming the meeting as highly productive, the DG ISPR expressed hope for further progress in building trust and enhancing practical cooperation in the days ahead, it said.
Meanwhile, the NPAC delegation expressed unwavering solidarity with Pakistan’s armed forces and reaffirmed their collective resolve to counter anti-state narratives and hostile propaganda, it said.
Assuring full cooperation in promoting the national narrative, the committee strongly condemned Fitna al Khawarij as well as the Afghan Taliban, stressing that terrorism had no justification under any circumstances, the report said.

 

The committee also announced plans to disseminate the message of Islamic unity, social harmony and constitutional equality across the country through mosques and other religious platforms, it said, adding that it was also agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance policy against hate speech and sectarianism.
The committee also proposed enhancing awareness and guidance sessions in mosques, seminaries and universities to effectively promote the state narrative.
The DG ISPR’s meeting comes less than a week after Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir emphasised the army’s zero-tolerance policy towards any threats to national security.
The CDF had made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison, where he also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination.
He said the armed forces “remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service”.</p><small>2026-01-13 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13145659d4b999d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966733/over-29000-trees-removed-in-islamabad-talal-chaudhry-says-more-to-be-planted' target='_blank'><strong>Over 29,000 trees removed in Islamabad; Talal Chaudhry says more to be planted</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Tuesday informed irked lawmakers in the National Assembly that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months.
In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.
PTI MNA Riaz Fatyana moved a calling attention notice on the tree-cutting in the federal capital and the public concern it was causing.
Responding to him, Chaudhry said 29,115 trees have been removed, while “40,000 trees of more than 8-10 feet have been planted”.
He added that another 60,000 trees will be planted in the same areas on March 30, when the weather will be more suitable for planting.

 

The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergy. However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land.
Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move, stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species.
Speaking in the NA, Chaudhry acknowledged that it was a matter of high importance and had been under discussion in the media for many days.
He explained that there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered green areas until they were built.
He invited the house and the journalists to assess the green areas based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) process, adding that the responsible authorities would be answerable if greenery is reduced or green areas are converted into brown.
“Greenery declined till 2020, but the data from 2023-2025 shows that the percentage of greenery has increased compared to before,” the state minister said.







Chaudhry also called for it “not to be made a fashion to make Islamabad the target of criticism or personally hit the CDA chairman”. He added that the decisions were not made by any one person, but taken under a policy.
On the criticism of infrastructure projects based on the argument that trees had to be cut for them, Chaudhry offered to give an on-ground briefing to parliamentarians and journalists on all such projects carried out under the current government.
“If any tree was removed, mature trees four times that number were planted,” he asserted.
On the reason for removing the paper mulberry species, Chaudhry highlighted that “by-air seeding” was carried out during Islamabad’s initial development to add greenery.
“Over time, it became evident that some of these species were hazardous to health, causing allergies and other issues,” he said.
The state minister recalled the Islamabad High Court’s 2009 order to speed up the eradication of paper mulberry trees to mitigate pollen allergies, and the formation of a committee in 2020 to ensure environmental protection in the capital.

 

He also cited a Supreme Court order from 2024, its suo-motu notice and the subsequent involvement of two forest experts regarding the removal of paper mulberry trees from the F-9 Park.
As a result, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was determined wherein a survey of the tree species and numbers is first conducted, followed by a public hearing, before proceeding to felling the trees.
Responding to a query by Fatyana, Chaudhry said, “We have not earned money by removing trees”. Instead, he added, money has been spent to remove trees harmful to health, as the roots of the paper mulberry species also need to be taken out.
“I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted.







PPP, PTI lawmakers raise concerns over ‘large-scale’ tree-cutting
Reacting to Chaudhry’s explanation, PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui said he had “attempted to justify the mass-cutting of trees, but nowhere in the world trees were felled on such a vast scale due to health issues, or pollen allergy from paper mulberry trees”.
She cited Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States as examples, stating that “targeted control” was employed there to get rid of saplings.
“There is a kingship. You stood up and said to root out the Green Belt because you suddenly realised that it was causing pollen allergy. It does not happen like this; there is a procedure,” Faruqui said.
She claimed that “huge mature trees” were cut down, adding: “This is no justification that you remove the entire Green Belt and say ‘we have planted four saplings’. Those four saplings would not grow up even in 50 years.”
Responding to her, Chaudhry said, “If you want to solve the issue, then stop point-scoring.”
He declared: “We will be responsible if the green area has decreased due to any mega-project, development, or court order.”
The state minister asserted there was “no kingship” and a proper process was followed.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar said he agreed with “most of” what Chaudhry said, but insisted that “many old trees” were also cut down, which gravely saddened the public.
“It was definitely needed for development, but then they should come forward and announce proactively how many trees we are planting in their place,” he said.



Speaking on points of order in the NA before Chaudhry’s explanation, PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan and PPP’s Shazia Marri also raised the issue of tree-cutting in Islamabad.
Ali said that if the interior ministry, the Islamabad administration or the climate change ministry had cut the trees “after taking the citizens of Islamabad into confidence, there would not have been mistrust in them”.
“The nearly 40,000 trees you have cut are the lungs of Islamabad,” the PTI lawmaker added. He further urged the relevant authorities to plant 100 saplings in the spring for each tree cut down.
Ali questioned why “50 to 60-year-old trees” were also removed if only paper mulberry trees were being replaced.
Marri also raised her party’s concerns over the “large-scale tree-cutting in Islamabad”. “Whether it is Shakarparian, F-9, or other areas, reports are emerging that thousands of trees are being cut,” she said.
The PPP lawmaker added, “Even if you are justifying it that a specific species harmful to the environment is being cut, but why are they running away from accountability?”
Marri demanded the “actual truth” and the figures on the tree plantation being carried out to make up for it. She recommended that the matter be referred to the NA’s Standing Committee for Climate Change for further debate.







Unanimous resolution urges govt to probe documented passengers’ offloading
Separately, the NA unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the government probe the offloading of documented passengers at various airports across the country.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents.

PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moved a resolution before the NA today, stating that the “government should take immediate steps to investigate the off-loading of documented passengers at various airports”.
The resolution also urged the government to recommend “administrative reforms to ensure transparency, accountability and the protection of passenger rights, while improving communication so that all off-loading decisions are lawful and properly documented”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then moved the resolution for voting, which received no opposition and was subsequently passed unanimously.







Speaking later on a point of order, PPP’s Marri termed the offloading of travellers a “very important” issue. “People going abroad for work or education as a result of a good offer, especially with all their complete documents, now have so much fear because of these actions.”
She noted the “demeanour adopted with them despite them having complete documents”, urging the government to take action on the matter.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had linked the offloading incidents to a crackdown on migrant smuggling by denying travel to those with incomplete documents.
In mid-December, growing public fury prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to finally take notice of the issue and form a “special committee” to look into the matter.

 

Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi issued orders to the FIA for the strict screening of travel documents at airports.
In the first week of December, Naqvi had said that 50–70 passengers were being offloaded daily from flights to protect the country’s passport reputation, which, at an average of 60 per day, comes to fewer than 22,000 in a year.
However, official figures showed that the actual number of offloaded passengers in 2025 was three times higher, at 66,000.
According to FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja, 51,000 of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.

Of the four victims, two were identified as a father and son. They all died on the spot, the official added.
Local sources said that the peace committee in the area has taken up arms in self-defense to resist militants, leading to an extremely tense situation in the area.
The police official further said that an investigation into the attack has been initiated, but added that it was too early to declare it an act of terrorism.
Attacks on peace committee members in KP have been on the rise in recent months. In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu.
Meanwhile, in October, a member of a tribal peace committee was killed in a clash with terrorists in the Ahmadzai area of Bannu district.</p><small>2026-01-13 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/131247455e2b39b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966732/pakistan-uae-to-sign-agreement-on-pre-immigration-clearance-in-bid-to-ease-process' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE to sign agreement on ‘pre-immigration clearance’ in bid to ease process</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan on Tuesday agreed to sign a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals visiting the Gulf country, said a statement by the Ministry of Interior.
The agreement, when signed, will enable Pakistani nationals to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE.
The decision was made in a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and a delegation from the UAE, led by Director General of Customs and Port Security Ahmed Bin Lahij Al Falasi, the press release said.
“The immigration process for the passengers will be completed in Pakistan before travel,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He added that with the implementation of the system, Pakistani nationals will be able to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE.
“They will be able to exit the airport directly like domestic passengers,” said Naqvi.
The interior minister detailed that the system will be launched as a pilot project, with the first phase set to begin in Karachi. He did not mention any date for the commencement of the pilot project.
Naqvi voiced optimism that the new system will “facilitate travel and improve the overall travel experience”.
The UAE delegation vowed to cooperate during the implementation of the initiative, labelling it as “beneficial” for both countries.
“Relevant authorities will coordinate with each other to finalise the administrative and technical aspects of the pilot project,” the statement read.
It added that after the pilot phase in Karachi, the system will be expanded to other cities as well.
Also present at the meeting were Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Federal Secretary for Interior Khurram Agha.
Restrictions on UAE visas
The development comes as Pakistanis, in the past year, have faced increased difficulties in obtaining visas to the UAE.
In November 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
The additional secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July last year, which prompted Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting held the same month, the UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
The UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi, in April had also announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.
The announcement came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January 2025, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, had said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2026-01-13 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13112950591c523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966730/china-rejects-indias-claim-over-shaksgam-valley-in-kashmir-asserts-territory-belongs-to-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>China rejects India’s claim over Shaksgam valley in Kashmir, asserts territory belongs to Beijing</strong></a><br><p>Beijing has rejected New Delhi’s claim over the Shaksgam valley in Kashmir and said that the territory “belongs to China”.
At a press conference on Monday, when asked by the Press Trust of India (PTI) for comment on the Indian criticism of China’s infrastructure development projects in the Shaksgam valley, China‘s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that it was “fully justified” for China to conduct infrastructure construction “on its own territory”.
“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” she said.
India’s foreign ministry spokesperson had on Friday said that it reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests as the Shaksgam valley was “an Indian territory”.
“We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement that happened in 1963. We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” he said at a press conference in response to a question from India’s state-owned public television broadcaster Doordashan.
The Indian spokesperson added that New Delhi also does not “recognise the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”.
“The entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India,” he maintained, adding, “This has been clearly conveyed to Pakistani and the Chinese authorities several times”.
He added that India had “consistently protested with the Chinese side against attempts to alter the ground reality in Shaksgam Valley”.
Mao Ning, in response to the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments, said that China and Pakistan had in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, terming it “the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries”.
“The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as an economic cooperation initiative, aims at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihood,” she said.
“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged.”
India and China have long clashed over border disputes, but had reached a milestone pact in 2024 on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed.
Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows.
However, Beijing and New Delhi continue to spar over territory, including Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Zangnan and says is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed.
Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.</p><small>2026-01-13 06:57</small></div><hr>
