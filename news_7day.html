On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander. The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran had challenged that dismissal before the apex court.
A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and comprising Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Hasan Azhar Rizvi resumed hearing the petitions today.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi represented the state. Both concluded their arguments, following which the CJP announced the bench’s decision.
However, Imran has multiple other cases against him. Imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, the PTI founder is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The PTI hailed the SC ruling, using the hashtag “Victory For Imran Khan” in its post on X.
 






Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar played down the development and said it was “sad” to see the party celebrating bail when Imran was already convicted. He added that bail was given to murderers, robbers and every criminal, saying that it did not mean acquittal and the case trial was still left.
“The trial process is underway. The May 9 case is the entire nation’s case … so much celebration on getting bail is beyond understanding. Does receiving bail mean burial or acquittal? The answer is no.”
 


The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, the Punjab prosecutor informed the court that he could not appear yesterday due to illness.
CJP Afridi, noting he had two questions from Naqvi, asked, “You must have read the Lahore High Court’s verdict. Can a final observation be made in a case of bail?”
During the hearing on August 12, the chief justice had raised questions over some observations made by the LHC, noting that the SC would not touch upon the legal findings so as not to affect any party’s case.
Asking his second question, the CJP said, “This same court (LHC) gave bail to a suspect on the charge of conspiracy. Will the principle of precedence not apply to this case?”
The prosecutor responded that a court’s observation in a bail case was always of an “interim nature”. “A court observation does not have any impact on the trial,” he contended.
When the hearing resumed after a brief break, the prosecutor requested that the court allow him to assist on the merits of the case.
However, CJP Afridi observed, “We will not allow anyone to argue on the merits of the case. You may only answer the legal questions pertaining to the conspiracy [charge].
“Show me a case where the Supreme Court has denied bail on conspiracy charges.”
He further said, “The Supreme Court has granted bail in two cases of similar allegations. Prove that your case is different from other cases.
CJP Afridi directed Naqvi to inform him about the details of the decision regarding the bail rejection and then read out the decisions in the court.
Following a brief break, Naqvi read out the bail approval decision in the Ejaz Ahmed Chaudhry case.
“You talk about conspiracy in the case. Is there any case in which there was a conspiracy and bail was rejected?” he questioned the prosecutor.
“Bail was granted in all the conspiracy cases that came up in the SC recently. The SC has granted bail in three cases of similar allegations,” he said, urging him to prove how the case was different from other conspiracy cases.
“There will be no evidence in conspiracy cases where bail was granted in the SC,” according to Naqvi. He argued that there was evidence of conspiracy on social media in the current case.
“You will not talk on merit at the stage of bail,” CJP Afridi remarked.
Meanwhile, Barrister Safdar said that he had data of all the bail cases related to conspiracy charges.
“The charges against Ejaz Chaudhry were of presence and conspiracy at the scene,” Justice Siddiqui said while Justice Rizvi questioned if Chaudhry was present on the spot on May 9 to which the prosecutor did not respond clearly.
“You are a prosecutor and you do not know the basic thing,” Justice Rizvi remarked while the chief justice questioned what evidence there was against Imran.
Naqvi said that the statements of three witnesses had been presented as evidence. “PTI founder has a central role in all cases,” he contended.
At this, CJP Afridi said, “If we go on merit, Salman Safdar will also speak.”
He added that the trial would be affected if the SC gave its observations on merit.
“My job was to warn you. The rest is up to you,” he stated and asked for other evidence in the case.
Justice Siddiqui asked, “What was the date of the FIR against the suspect?”
“The suspect is named in three out of 10 cases. The FIR was registered on May 9,” the prosecutor answered.
He said that the SC allowed the trial court to approach the court to conduct three tests of the founder, adding that the police approached the magistrate for voice matching, photogrammetric and polygrammatic tests.
“Despite the court’s permission, the suspect could not conduct the tests,” he added.
“If that is the case, there will be legal consequences,” CJP Afridi remarked.
“Are such tests normally conducted in other cases as well?” Justice Hassan Rizvi asked.
According to Naqvi, the law prohibited bail for the suspect. “There is solid evidence against the suspect,” he said.
“The evidence will be proven in the trial court,” CJP Afridi said.
“After the incident, the suspect was on bail for two months until his arrest,” Justice Rizvi said. He asked whether the two-month period was not enough for the police investigation.
The court approved eight bail applications of PTI founder following Naqvi and Safdar’s arguments.</p><small>2025-08-21 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/211750576fe6cc6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932442/at-least-34-injured-following-explosion-blaze-at-warehouse-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>At least 34 injured following explosion, blaze at warehouse in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>At least 34 men were injured when a massive explosion took place inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on Thursday afternoon, according to police and hospital officials.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that 20 injured people were brought to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, including two with critical wounds, while 14 other men were brought to the trauma centre at Civil Hospital Karachi, with two in critical condition.
“The condition of other wounded persons is being evaluated,” she said.
Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that there was a three-storey building near Taj Medical Complex in Saddar where families resided on upper floors, while the facility was situated in the basement.
“Raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers was stored [in this facility],” Khan said. “During the initial probe, it was suspected that a short circuit triggered a fire in the store and a huge explosion took place because of the presence of highly inflammable material.”
The spokesperson added that the building’s pillars and walls were damaged, while thick concrete blocks had fallen on parked vehicles nearby. Windows in nearby buildings were also smashed.

“Twelve fire tenders from KMC’s Fire Brigade and Rescue-1122 were engaged in firefighting,” he stated. “Due to the presence of explosive material, the fire reignited frequently. Firefighters were facing difficulties as there was dense smoke emanating from the basement.”
Khan said that the fire was 60-70 per cent under control and efforts were underway to control it.
However, Counter-Terrorism Department senior official Raja Umer Khattab told reporters at the scene that the facility contained explosive material, not raw material for fireworks.
“CTD had seized two tons of explosive material in this area in the recent past,” he said, noting that the raw material in fireworks could also be used in bombs.
“As per the relevant laws, up to 50 kilogrammes of firecracker material may be stored in a shop with certain conditions and SOPs (standard operating procedures) in place,” Khattab said.
“Facilities storing firecracker material should be kept away from petrol pumps and residential areas. The deputy commissioner and other authorities concerned may issue licenses to this effect.”
The CTD official said that firecrackers and fireworks were both imported and manufactured in Pakistan. In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, only license holders could manufacture firecrackers or import them.
Khattab claimed that there was no “industry or factory for manufacturing firecrackers” in Sindh and estimated that more than 50kg of material might have been stored in the basement of the building. He termed the presence of such quantities of explosive material in residential areas “a highly dangerous thing”.
“The people do not consider it dangerous as they just call it firecrackers,” lamented the CTD official. “This shop or godown was illegally established in a residential area, which caused substantial damage to human life and property.”
According to a statement issued by the Karachi Traffic Police, MA Jinnah Road is closed to traffic due to the fire, with traffic coming from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.
The traffic police directed citizens to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate route options “to avoid inconvenience”.
 


Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and ordered authorities to ensure that the blaze is brought under control and that no lives are lost.
According to a statement, the CM ordered the Karachi commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report to his office once the fire is controlled.
“There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, the Sindh Home Department issued a statement today claiming that 20 people were injured in the blaze, while Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to head to the scene.
“Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. “An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”
The home minister also ordered that authorities include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene in their investigation.
“It should be checked immediately whether the firework factory has a licence or not,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
 






Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Earlier this month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control after hours of efforts.
In June, a fire erupted in Karachi’s Millennium Mall, ostensibly due to an electrical short circuit, and destroyed several hundred shops, causing substantial financial losses. It was brought under control after hectic efforts lasting several hours.</p><small>2025-08-21 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21174854fbf85b8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932484/india-says-no-bilateral-sporting-ties-with-pakistan-but-cricket-team-for-asia-cup-wont-be-stopped' target='_blank'><strong>India says no bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, but cricket team for Asia Cup won’t be stopped</strong></a><br><p>India’s sports ministry on Thursday declared that India and Pakistan would not have any bilateral sporting ties even on neutral venues as per an unprecedented new policy but the cricket team would not be stopped from playing the Asia Cup next month as it is a multi-lateral engagement, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Political tensions bet­ween the two nations over the years have cast a sha­d­ow over bilateral sporting events, causing major tournaments to hang in the balance. The countries’ teams have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, electing to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) instructed all national sports federations to seek prior consultation and approval before participating in any sporting events held in India due to ’“security concerns”.
According to PTI, India’s sports ministry unveiled the new policy with regard to India’s international engagements with emphasis on Pakistan.
It added that a well-placed ministry source said the policy, which bars Indian athletes from travelling to Pakistan and likewise disallows disallows Pakistani sportspersons from going to India for bilaterals, was effective immediately.
Asked if Indian teams would be allowed to travel to Pakistan for any multilateral competitions, the source was quoted as saying: “In that scenario, we will examine the case before deciding anything.”
 


According to the new policy, “India’s approach to sports events involving Pakistan reflects its overall policy in dealing with that country.”
“With regard to international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons,” the policy read.
“It is also relevant to take into account India’s emergence as a credible venue to host international sports events.”
Accordingly, Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan, the policy stated, adding that Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India.
Earlier this month, it was announced that the Pakistan-India clash for the T20 Asia Cup would be held in Dubai on Sept 14.
In July, a cricket match between India and Pakistan was called off after Indian players, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
“We held fruitful and substantive discussions today covering diverse areas of mutual interest,” Dar said, addressing a joint press conference with Wang in Islamabad.
He continued, “We took stock of progress achieved since the last round of Strategic Dialogue. We also exchanged views on the entire gamut of Pakistan-China relations, including CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor), trade and investment, science and technology and people-to-people cooperation.”
“The important developments pertaining to our region and the world at large were also reviewed,” he said, adding that both sides enjoyed “complete unanimity of use and consensus on all important matters”.
 


Dar also mentioned the tri-lateral meeting with Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi, stating, “Recently our two countries have worked together to establish tri-lateral partnerships with other countries in the region.
“These mechanisms signify our joint resolve to promote regional peace, stability and prosperity, and to share the dividends of Pak-China friendship with other countries in the region and beyond.”
He further said, “We also discussed preparations for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s forthcoming visit to China. The PM will attend the Shan­ghai Cooperation Organi­sation Council of Heads of States summit and also meet top Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.”
He announced that the Pak-China B2B Investment Conference will also be organised during the PM’s visit to China.
Wang described CPEC as the cornerstone of Pakistan and China’s strategic partnership, stating that the current priority was to advance development of the corridor.
He said that during the sixth strategic dialogue, both sides agreed to upgrade CPEC into “a growth corridor, livelihood-enhancing corridor, green corridor and open corridor”.
“We will work hard to deepen our industrial agriculture and mining cooperation to improve the Pakistani people’s welfare, accelerate Pakistan’s capability for self-sustained development and increase Pakistan’s economic resilience,” Wang said.
He added that China was also supporting the development and operation of Gwadar Port and promoting the Karakoram Highway realignment project.
Wang also welcomed third-party participation in the ML-1 (Main Line) railway project.
Additionally, China’s top diplomat said that Beijing would warmly welcome Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of State Council summit in Tianjin at the end of this month.
“The two sides will jointly prepare and ensure the success of the series of activities for the 75th anniversary of China-Pakistan diplomatic relations next year,” he said.
Wang also extended his condolences for the lives lost in the recent floods, assuring that Beijing would “immediately provide emergency humanitarian assistance”.
The Chinese foreign minister also commended Pakistan’s role in combatting terrorism, stating that Islamabad was “effectively protecting the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions” in the country.
“China highly commends Pakistan’s tireless efforts in combatting terrorism, as it firmly believes that Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operation will secure victory,” Wang stated.
In response to a question about China’s relations with India, Wang stated that the partnership would “not affect any third party”.
Wang arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier today, to attend the sixth Strategic Dialogue between China and Pakistan, where he was received by FM Dar.
 






Wang had arrived in Islamabad last night, where he was received by Dar.
“Delighted to receive my dear friend, H.E. Wang Yi, Foreign Minister China, in Pakistan this evening,” Dar wrote on social media yesterday.
He added, “I look forward to productive discussions tomorrow at our dialogue, and with the leadership during his calls on President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.”
 






A day earlier, the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue was held in Kabul between Dar, Wang and Afghan counterpart Muttaqi on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism,“ the Foreign Office said. “They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC to Afghanistan.”
 






Last month, Pakistan and China agreed to launch joint training programmes in multiple fields, including construction engineering, artificial intelligence, agriculture and hospitality management, under the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II).
PM Shehbaz is expected to travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the SCO summit from August 31 to September 1. On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Earlier this week, the government announced that this upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC-II, focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.</p><small>2025-08-21 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21142431f5ebd52.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932318/army-chief-did-not-seek-apology-over-may-9-culprits-should-be-held-accountable-dg-ispr-clarifies' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief did not seek apology over May 9, culprits should be held accountable, DG ISPR clarifies</strong></a><br><p>Military spokesperson Lieutenant-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry clarified on Thursday that Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir did not seek an apology from anyone over the May 9, 2023 riots, saying the perpetrators should be “held accountable”, Geo News reported.
The remarks come days after it was reported that the army chief had sought an apology over the 2023 countrywide protests — apparently from the PTI, which the state holds responsible for the May 9 riots.
Suhail Warraich, a senior editor for the Daily Jang newspaper, wrote in a column on August 16 that COAS Munir had spoken to him in person recently in Belgium’s capital of Brussels, where the army chief had stopped over on his return from his visit to the United States.
“On a question about politics, he (the army chief) said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read, without specifying who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about.
“Neither did the army chief make any political statement in Brussels, nor did he mention any apology,” Geo News quoted Lt-Gen Chaudhry as saying today.
Lt-Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, was speaking to reporters after an event in Islamabad.
The DG ISPR was further reported as saying that the army chief “did not say anything about the PTI”.
Lt-Gen Chaudhry asserted: “May 9 is not only the military’s case but the nation’s case. It is clear that those who carried out the May 9 [riots], their enablers and planners should be held accountable as per the law.”
“There were hundreds of people present at the Brussels event. Those attending the event had their pictures taken with the field marshal,” the DG ISPR noted.
He also termed Pakistan a “country that changes the region’s destinies”, according to the report. “This is the reason why it is frequently attacked. The youth should understand the legacy and history of their ideological state,” he said.
Following the report about the army chief’s Brussels talk, the PTI reiterated its demand for an empowered judicial commission to probe the May 9 riots, the November 26 protest incident, and the 2024 general elections.
 
 

The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and, in May 2024, demanded an apology from PTI founder Imran Khan, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9.
However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified.
Earlier this month, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Industries Rana Ihsaan Afzal said the government would be able to consider a pardon for Imran if he were to issue an apology for his “crimes”.
In June, Imran’s sister Aleem Khan claimed that the ex-premier had been asked several times to apologise for the May 9 violent protests.</p><small>2025-08-21 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21130621a806f63.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932291/police-fire-tear-gas-as-clashes-erupt-with-sost-protesters-in-gb-organisers-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Police fire tear gas as clashes erupt with Sost protesters in GB, organisers claim</strong></a><br><p>A clash broke out between police and protesters in the early hours of Thursday, leaving several injured, protest organisers claimed, as traders continued to block routes in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Sost Valley.
Last month, Pak-China Tajeer Etihad Action Committee launched a protest against the suspension of border trade via the Khunjerab Pass, blaming the federal government’s inaction over unresolved tax-related issues, which have inflicted heavy losses on importers and exporters over the year.
One of the organisers, Muhammad Ismail, claimed that the police had launched a crackdown against peaceful protesters, stating: “Police resorted to tear gas and aerial firing to disperse protesters from the venue.”
Speaking to reporters, Hunza Superintendent of Police Nabeel Ahmed said that there was no plan to launch a crackdown on the sit-in.
“Police were deployed only to arrest a suspect who is allegedly extorting traders at the customs and immigration area upon their return from China,” he said. “The sit-in organisers had been asked to hand over the suspect for investigation, but they have not done so yet.”
The protest organisers said that the police and district administration had warned the protesters to disperse from Sost.
Addressing an emergency press conference, Ismail, Ebadullah, Gul Sher and other committee members claimed that the police launched “an attack on protesters at midnight to sabotage the peaceful protest for the rights of GB people”.
The protest organisers said they had been engaged with various committees, including one constituted by the prime minister for negotiations, but claimed that “the government resorted to using force”.
The organisers highlighted that the GB traders were protesting for one month for their genuine demands, including customs clearance of 280 consignments which have been stranded at the Sost Dry Port for 10 months.
Opposition Leader in the GB Assembly, Kazim Mesum, issued a statement condemning the use of force, warning the government that suppressing peaceful demonstrations could ignite a larger movement across GB.
Separately, the Sost Bazaar Association held a shutter-down strike and protest rally against the shelling and firing by police and FC.
During a press conference, the association’s President, Ulfat Karim, said, “Sales tax and income tax are not applicable as GB was not constitutionally part of Pakistan.”
The association condemned the authorities’ action against the traders and denounced the indiscriminate shelling of shops, petrol pumps, hotels, and other properties, announcing its full support for the ongoing sit-in.
On July 28, traders in GB blocked Sost dry port, halting all trade and travel between Pakistan and China. The protest on the Kara­k­oram High­w­­ay (KKH) has paralysed the regional economy and stranded travellers, including Chinese nationals who also staged a protest demanding passage into China through the Khunjerab pass.
In June, thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded at KKH for many hours after traders had blocked the road. The protesters vowed that the road connecting Pakistan with China would remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.</p><small>2025-08-21 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21154212291465c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932330/lahore-man-accused-of-sextortion-of-minor-sent-on-5-day-physical-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore man accused of ‘sextortion’ of minor sent on 5-day physical remand</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore man accused of “sextortion” of a minor via social media platform Snapchat was handed over to police for a five-day physical remand, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) said on Thursday.
As per the court order given by a district and sessions court in Lahore, it was notified that the accused should be handed over to the police for a five-day investigation.
According to NCCIA’s application for the remand, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the accused was arrested after NCCIA received a tip-off from an international organisation. He was booked for sharing pornographic material via the social media application Snapchat and engaging in “sextortion” of a minor.
Upon arrest, NCCIA confiscated the phone of the accused and found pornographic material on the phone, in its “screenshot” and “screen-recording” folders.
 
 

During the initial interrogation conducted by the NCCIA, the accused confessed to the crimes.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against the accused under Section 22 (unauthorised use of identity information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca).
The court ordered the accused to be presented on 26 August.
The investigation officer, NCCIA sub-inspector Shafqat Ehsan, had requested a 14-day physical remand, which was denied.
According to a report by a child rights organisation, Sahil, as many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024.  A gender-divide analysis indicated that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
Of the 200 cases of child sexual abuse reported, 93 of the child victims were male and 108 were female.
Earlier this week, the interior ministry informed the Senate that of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025, 200 of them involved children.

The move comes amid growing global concerns that investment in AI is moving too fast. In July, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg had pledged hundreds of billions for AI data centres in a “superintelligence push”.
The social media giant is among the large tech companies that have struck high-profile deals and doled out multi-million-dollar pay packages in recent months to fast-track work on machines that could outthink humans on many tasks.
“The hiring freeze, which went into effect last week and coincides with a broader restructuring of the group, also prohibits current employees from moving across teams inside the division,” according to the WSJ report.
“The duration of the freeze wasn’t communicated internally.”
“All that’s happening here is some basic organisational planning: creating a solid structure for our new superintelligence efforts after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises,” a spokesperson for Meta said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
Earlier this week, Meta had planned the fourth restructuring of AI efforts in six months, according to The Information.
“The company is expected to divide its new AI unit, Superintelligence Labs, into four groups: a new “TBD Lab,” short for to be determined; a products team including the Meta AI assistant; an infrastructure team; and the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab focused on long-term research,” the report said.</p><small>2025-08-21 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2113562911d3806.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932301/restoration-of-mobile-data-services-in-balochistan-underway-on-bhc-orders' target='_blank'><strong>Restoration of mobile data services in Balochistan underway on BHC orders</strong></a><br><p>The restoration of mobile services in Balochistan was underway on Thursday after the Balochistan High Court (BHC) ordered their immediate resumption, ending a 15-day suspension.
Earlier this month, mobile data services in the province were announced to be suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”. Balochistan’s Consumer Civil Society chairman, Khair Muhammad Shaheen, had filed a constitutional petition against the Pakistan Tele­communication Authority and others regarding the suspension of mobile phone internet services.
The petition argued that the mobile phone services were a basic mode of communication for businessmen, students, educational institutions and others. It added that the suspension constituted a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 15 (freedom of movement etc), 18 (freedom of trade, business and profession), 19-A (right to information) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
A two-member BHC bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, conducted the first hearing on the petition on August 13, ordering the At­­torney General for Pakis­tan (AGP) Mansoor Awan and Balochistan Advocate General Adnan Basharat to file their replies on the shutdown of internet services in the province.
The same bench heard the case today, ruling that mobile internet services must be restored in Quetta within two hours.
Following the court’s order, mobile internet service has been restored in Quetta and some areas of Pishin and Chaman. Services will be fully restored in Dalbandin, Pishin, Chaman and Taftan within the next two hours, according to PTA officials.
“Orders related to mobile internet restoration are being implemented,” said PTA Director Jamil Ahmed, who appeared in the court when the hearing resumed after a break.
He added that internet services had been restored in some districts, but added that it “takes some time to restore the system”.
The hearing was adjourned until August 25, with the Chief Justice Barrech adding that if mobile internet was not restored by that date, the PTA secretary would be found in contempt of court.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
In November of last year, the PTA had announced the government’s decision to suspend internet and mobile services with immediate effect in many districts of Balochistan to ensure public safety, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-08-21 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/211104543a4a96e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932108/contact-shot-caused-death-of-journalist-khawar-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>‘Contact shot’ caused death of journalist Khawar, says report</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD: A provisional report of the second post-mortem of deceased DawnNews reporter Khawar Hussain Bajwa has described head injury by a ‘contact shot’ of a firearm as cause of his death on Aug 16 in Sanghar.

The severe flooding destroyed earthen homes and agricultural fields in Sumra Nashaib, Dulu Nas­haib, Lohanch Nashaib, Mir­ani Paka, Loni, Darkhan, Cha­dhar, Mohana, and Mosan Shah, leaving families displaced and without shelter. Many struggle to save livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
In Taunsa, several villages such as Bait Lakho, Jarh Leghari, Jarah, Urra, Bodu Manaan, Thulla Chaki, Eida Arain, Basti Habib, Lal Shah, and Kotla Miran have been submerged, with houses reduced to rubble. Thousands of acres of crops in these areas are underwater and entirely ruined, leaving the displaced population without shelter or livelihood, forced to live under the open sky.
In Muzaffargarh, hundreds of residents in villages of Tehsils Jatoi and Alipur were also compelled to evacuate as floodwaters from the Indus inundated their areas.
 






In Tehsil Jatoi, the villages of Laskani and Kehal saw mass evacuations after a breach of 10 to 15 feet occurred in a Zamindara bund. Locals attempted to fill the breach on their own, receiving no assistance from district or divisional authorities.
Similarly, in Alipur tehsil, the villages of Bait Dewan, Mouza Shahpur, Mouza Thehri, Mouza Phul Sanjra, Basti Gishkori, Basti Faizu Mandoos, Basti Allah Bachaya Gopang, Basti Kolachi, Basti Bosan, Basti Turk, Basti Lashari, and Basti Noor Mand Gopang have also been inundated. Cotton, sesame, mung beans, and other crops have been destroyed.
In the Langarwah area of Alipur tehsil, the rising level of Indus River breached a flood protection bund on Wednesday, inundating hundreds of homes and vast agricultural lands.
Wazir Khan Gopang, a resident of Bait Dewan, said that his 20 acres of sesame and 10 acres of cotton had been destroyed. He lamented the government’s failure to take preventive measures. He and his family had to relocate, and he was struggling to save his livestock amid the rising floodwaters.
PDMA warning
As rivers swell and dams near maximum capacity, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a red alert across Punjab. With rainfall expected to continue until August 24, district administrations have been instructed to stay on high alert, and citizens are urged to exercise extreme caution.
 
 

The PDMA issued a comprehensive alert following widespread monsoon rains and warned of a worsening flood situation in several districts.
Over the past 24 hours, Narowal recorded the highest rainfall at 94mm, followed by Sargodha (54mm), Joharabad (39mm), Sheikhupura (36mm), and Faisalabad (31mm), with significant precipitation also reported in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, and other major cities.
Heavy rains are expected to continue in most districts of Punjab until August 24, with concerns over thundershowers and potential cloudbursts in the upper regions.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the current monsoon spell was a bit more intense than the previous ones and directed all district administrations to remain on high alert.
The Indus River is experiencing medium-level flooding at Taunsa and Chashma, while low-level flooding has been reported at Tarbela and Kalabagh.
The Sutlej River is also at a low flood level at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki.
Critical water storage levels indicate that Tarbela Dam is at 98pc capacity and Mangla Dam at 74pc, while Indian dams are reportedly around 70pc full.
Authorities have warned of a likely increase in water flow in the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers and their tributaries due to the anticipated heavy rains.
The alert has been issued to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and relevant departments including local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, and transport.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed has instructed Wasa officials and district administrations to take preventive measures and ensure full emergency preparedness.
Citizens have been advised to exercise extreme caution during the rainy season, particularly keeping children away from rainwater drains, low-lying areas, rivers, and canals.
Rescue and relief agencies have been directed to maintain their presence in the field during periods of rainfall.

According to the Zoom Earth weather tracking website, an intense system forming over Sindh would hit urban centres like Hyderabad and Karachi after midnight on Wedn­esday. The system, which is likely to head out to sea by the morning, might precipitate heavily concentrated downpours in lower Sindh.
 
 

A spokesman for the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA) advised residents in vulner­able areas, including Karachi, Hyde­rabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas and Sukkur, to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
Urban flooding is expe­cted to persist in Kar­achi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
Simultaneously, districts such as Thatta, Badin, Jamshoro and Da­du face an elevated risk of flash flooding.
Rising water levels in the Indus River and its tributaries may inundate low-lying areas, prompting fears of widespread disruption.
Major highways and local roads could be sub merged, severely affecting traffic and daily routines across the region.
In anticipation of flooding, authorities have urged residents to relocate valuables and livestock to safer locations.
Households are advised to prepare emergency kits with essential supplies, including food, water, medicines and first aid. Extreme caution is recommended when handling electrical appliances, and submerged roads or electric poles should be strictly avoided.
Disruptions in power and telecom services are also likely. Citizens are encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.

Talking to the media and responding to a question on coordination and accountability among agencies during a visit to the city a day after heavy rain lashed the metropolis, the CM expressed concern over the performance of some local  representatives, including JI’s town chairmen, particularly after the formation of town administrations, which he said had led to division and inefficiency in  service delivery.
 
 

He acknowledged certain shortcomings, welcomed constructive criticism, and announced disciplinary action against officials who failed to perform.
He underlined the urgent need for modern and efficient drainage systems to mitigate the impact of extreme weather in the future, ensuring urban resilience and citizens’ safety.

CM acknowledges shortcomings in dealing with rain, vows disciplinary action against negligent officials

He said about “160 to 170 millimetres” of rain had fallen within three to four hours, aggregating to “185 to 200mm” in 12 hours — levels that naturally cause urban flooding in a densely populated city.
Despite the torrential rain, the chief minister claimed that the administration had managed to clear water from the city by late night.
Recalling the catastrophic flooding of 2020, he noted how water then had remained stagnant for over 24 hours, contrasting it with the relatively prompt drainage this time.
 
 

Addressing questions, Mr Shah said the World Bank had approved a $1.6 billion package for Karachi in 2020, with $100 million already disbursed, primarily to strengthen the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
He rejected “misleading narratives” about the funds, stressing that disbursements were phased and conditional on performance. He added that approximately Rs28 to Rs30b had been utilised transparently so far for critical water infrastructure upgrades.
Highlighting the chronic issue of fragmented road-cutting permissions issued independently by agencies such as the Cantonment Boards, KDA and KMC, he proposed establishing a “Central Road Cutting Authority” to regulate and oversee road excavation and repair, thereby preventing repeated damage to city roads.
He also pointed out that the powers of certain institutions, including the water board, had been devolved to the mayor’s office to strengthen urban governance. He praised Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab for enhancing resources and taking practical steps instead of merely demanding funds.

Judge Caprio, host of ABC series ‘Caught in Providence’ was known for his kindness, even while serving justice. According to CNN, Caprio billed his courtroom as a place “where people and cases are met with kindness and compassion“.
“Judge Frank Caprio passed away peacefully at the age of 88 after a long and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer,” said a post on the social media-famous judge’s Facebook account.
 
 

“Beloved for his compassion, humility, and unwavering belief in the goodness of people, Judge Caprio touched the lives of millions through his work in the courtroom and beyond,” the post recalled.
“His warmth, humour and kindness left an indelible mark on all who knew him […] In his honour, may we each strive to bring a little more compassion into the world — just as he did every day.”
Videos of Caprio “treating defendants with empathy and respect gained more than a billion views on social media and earned him the title of ‘the nicest judge in the world’”, Time magazine noted.
In clips posted on YouTube, Caprio is “often seen empathising with those in his courtroom”, CNN noted. “Caprio also used his fame to address issues like unequal access to the judicial system.”
In 2019, the internet sensation won the hearts of many when his interaction with a Pakistani student went viral. Caprio let off Ahmad Salman, an immigrant student, for three parking tickets.
A month later, the judge invited Salman to his family’s Sunday dinner, according to a snippet shared by the Caught in Providence show in 2022.
In a video statement, Judge Caprio’s son detailed that his father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago.
“It was the love and support that he received from all of you that lifted his spirits and boosted his soul to find the strength to fight on and outlive his diagnosis by a year and a half.
Caprio served as chief judge of the municipal court of Providence, Rhode Island, from 1985 to 2023, according to Time. He is survived by his wife Joyce Caprio, five children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p><small>2025-08-21 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21111759289fc2f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932283/olympic-champion-imane-khelif-denies-malicious-claims-of-retirement' target='_blank'><strong>Olympic champion Imane Khelif denies ‘malicious’ claims of retirement</strong></a><br><p>Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has denied claims made by her former manager that she has retired from the sport, saying she is still training regularly.
Algerian Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting were in the spotlight at the Paris Games last year over their eligibility after they had been disqualified from the 2023 World Championships by the IBA, which said sex chromosome tests had ruled them ineligible.
However, they competed in the women’s category in Paris after being cleared by the International Olympic Committee, with both winning gold medals in their weight classes.
Khelif has not competed since her win in Paris.
In an interview with French newspaper Nice-Matin on Wednesday, Khelif’s former manager Nasser Yesfah said she had “left the world of boxing”.
In a follow-up interview with the same newspaper hours later, Yesfah clarified he was only referring to Khelif’s boxing commitments in the city of Nice, where she was previously part of the Nice Azur club.
Khelif criticised Yesfah’s comments in a post on Facebook on Wednesday.
“It is based solely on statements made by a person who no longer represents me in any way, and whom I consider to have betrayed my trust and my country with his false and malicious statements,” Khelif wrote.
“I have never announced my retirement from boxing. I remain committed to my sporting career, training regularly and maintaining my physical fitness between Algeria and Qatar in preparation for upcoming events.
“The publication of such rumours is intended solely to disrupt and damage my sporting and professional career.”
Khelif had been due to compete in a World Boxing tournament in the Netherlands in June, but opted to skip it shortly after the governing body initially announced its plans to introduce sex testing for all boxers in its competitions.
World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst later apologised after Khelif was named in their announcement on mandatory sex testing, saying her privacy should have been protected.
Khelif, 26, has repeatedly said she was born a woman and has a long history in female boxing competitions. In March, she said she would defend her title at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p><small>2025-08-21 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2110080859227ee.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932122/rescue-operation-in-flood-hit-areas-completed-kp-cabinet-told' target='_blank'><strong>Rescue operation in flood-hit areas completed, KP cabinet told</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Rescue operation in the flood-hit areas has been completed, while search for the missing persons is still under way, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet was informed on Wednesday.
The cabinet met with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair and its members and senior government officials in attendance.
Officials informed participants that damage to infrastructure and public lives and property by rains and flash floods was being assessed and once the exercise was completed, its details would be laid before the cabinet.
Additional chief secretary (home and tribal affairs) Abid Majid said the relevant departments had been directed to expedite data collection for the early provision of compensation to the affected families.

CM orders immediate restoration of health centres, water supply

He said mobile phone service providers should ensure complete restoration of their coverage in the calamity-hit areas to people to get connected with relatives.
Mr Majeed said the planning and development department had come up with an app to ensure easy access to data in the affected areas.
Mr Gandapur said the compensation was being provided to the families of those killed in floods and those who suffered injuries.
He ordered immediate restoration of health centres in affected areas with full availability of essential medicines and deployment of mobile hospitals.
The chief minister called for proactive measures to prevent possible outbreaks of epidemics, provision of fodder for livestock, and necessary steps to protect animals from diseases.
He ordered the immediate restoration of drinking water schemes such as tube wells, and the speedy rehabilitation of road connectivity.
“We [government] will ensure that those whose houses were destroyed are provided with new homes, while the compensation covers livestock losses. Also, businessmen will be supported with a comprehensive relief package,” he said.
The chief minister said in addition to the already allocated Rs3 billion, Rs2 billion was released to strengthen ongoing relief and rehabilitation efforts in the flood-affected areas.
While responding to the urgent needs of various departments and the pressing requirement for rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by the recent floods, the cabinet approved a supplementary grant of Rs20 billion, according to an official statement.
It added that the funds would be utilised for fast-moving and near-completion projects across the province to ensure fast completion.
The cabinet sanctioned financial assistance for victims of the recent floods, approving Rs2 million for each deceased and Rs0.50 million for each injured besides approved the release of Rs1 billion (initially) to Provincial Disaster Management Authority for the launch of the “Food Stamp” initiative under which Rs15,000 would be provided to each flood-affected family.
It approved Rs180.300 million as a one-time special grant to KP Police for the families of Shuhada and for injured police personnel besides approved Shuhada package for the five martyred crew members of the helicopter crash in Mohmand during Bajaur air relief operation.
In view of the forthcoming holy month of Rabi-ul-Awal, the cabinet approved the sanction and release of Rs62.3 million as Grant-in-Aid for organising Seerat Conferences in Peshawar, divisional headquarters, and all districts of the province.
The cabinet approved exemption from the “release policy” for the financial year 2025-26 for the Peshawar High Court and granted it full access to the SAP system for posting funds to individual projects under the Law & Justice Sector, along with authority to carry out intra-sectoral re-appropriations, in line with last year’s practice.
It also granted approval to the financial assistance of Rs20 million in favour of Shaukat Yousafzai, former member of KP Assembly, for medical treatment.
The cabinet approved the transfer of two kanals of land in the name of relief, rehabilitation and resettlement department for the establishment of a Rescue 1122 station in Barang tehsil of Bajaur district and a non-ADP scheme amounting to Rs1.38 billion for the construction of Kumbar Bypass Road in Lower Dir district.
It also approved draft amendments to the KP Right to Public Service Act, 2014, and the appointment of chief commissioner to the KP Right to Public Service Commission and the nomination of two members for the Workers Welfare Board.

• Letter says CJP’s response, now in public domain, neither provides valid reason nor legal justification for not convening full court
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s decision to make public the minutes of the committee meeting held on Oct 31, 2024 — convened to call a full court session to determine the vires (validity) of the 26th Constitutional Amendment — has caused a considerable stir on the judicial front.
Two notes from Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi were  uploaded on the SC’s official website on August 14, reviving the debate  on 26th Amendment controversy.
On Wednesday, a letter surfaced from two senior judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. The letter appeared to be a response to the publication of the minutes of the three-judge committee formed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
The two judges had convened the committee meeting on Oct 31, last year and had formally requested CJP Afridi to constitute a full court to hear the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
The two notes from the CJP suggested that he had declined to implement the committee’s decision to place the constitutional challenges before the full court comprising all judges of the apex court, beca­use such a move could dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among the judges and further expose the court to public scrutiny.
However, in response to CJP’s explanation, both judges wrote a joint letter on Wed­nesday. In the letter, they wrote: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending, and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e., the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.
This was the most appropriate forum (in terms of composition) to resolve the fundamental constitutional issues in a manner that would not only satisfy the dictates of law and justice but also ensure a judicial decision whose legitimacy could not be questioned.”
Consensus
As a result, the court failed to develop an institutional response. The judges emphasised that this process could not be substituted by the CJP’s informal individual meetings with judges — especially when the other two committee members (the judges themselves) were neither involved in, nor invited to, these informal consultations.
In the letter, the judges wrote that they had made strenuous efforts to have a full court meeting convened — either through a sitting on the judicial side or at least an administrative meeting —to hear the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
At a time when no issue was more important for the court, a consensus was needed. That consensus, they stated, could only have been achieved in a manner consistent with the law and the court’s usual practice — through a full court meeting. Unfortunately, that consensus never emerged, the letter lamented.
“What was required,” the letter noted, “was collective deliberation and decision-making. That, regrettably, never took place. At a time when no question was more important for the court, a consensus should have been immediately sought through a full court meeting to enable the judiciary to respond institutionally.”
Such a response, they added, could only have come from the judges themselves — by convening in open court or in a full conclave. The dire consequences of not doing so, the letter warned, continue to reverberate through the court, the wider judiciary, and the entire constitutional framework.
The letter also expressed regret over the violation of the committee’s decision as it transitioned to a more formal phase. The Oct 31st meeting had been properly convened under the law, and the majority in attendance had made binding decisions reflected in the official minutes.
This decision, they wrote, was legally binding and could not be disregarded. When the challenges were not scheduled for hearing on Nov 4, 2024, as directed by the committee, the two judges wrote again — partly as a protest and certainly to ensure compliance. Unfortunately, this letter, too, was disregarded.
The judges reiterated that a binding decision of the committee had not been implemented. They stated they had thoroughly examined both notes of the CJP — now available in the public domain — and concluded that they neither provided a valid reason nor legal justification for non-compliance. “Had the full court been timely convened, as required by law,” they emphasised, “the entire matter would have been deliberated appropriately.”
Regarding the meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the judges observed that neither of the CJP’s two notes had been shared with other committee members. One of the notes was merely read aloud by the CJP at the JCP meeting on Nov 5, 2024.
The judges argued that the JCP was not the appropriate forum for addressing this issue, nor could the committee’s Oct 31 decision have been referred to the constitutional bench or any related committee on either Oct 31 or Nov 5, as such entities did not exist at that time.
Moreover, they said, those entities lacked the jurisdiction to override or nullify a lawful decision taken by the committee.
“We reiterate that on both of those dates,” the judges wrote, “the only legally binding decision in effect was that of the committee on Oct 31, which ought to have been fully implemented in both letter and spirit. Regrettably, this was never done.”
Finally, the judges addressed the public release of the committee’s minutes and related documents on the SC’s website. “Since the minutes and record have now been uploaded, despite the committee’s previous directive against doing so, and are irreversibly in the public domain,” the judges wrote, “we now require that this letter also be placed on the website alongside the record and materials related to the Oct 31 meeting.”
“If this is not done immediately,” the letter concluded, “this communication may be placed in the public domain through other appropriate means. And if, ultimately, it is now for History to judge — then let the record, at the very least, be complete.”

Speaking to media here, the Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, said that sustainable peace
in the province requires collective efforts and public cooperation. He said that following arrest of a key suspect in Quetta, the scope of investigations has been expanded.
He said that security agencies had received intelligence regarding certain target killers, which led to raids at multiple locations in the province. Several suspects were taken into custody during these operations.

According to the spokesperson, a lawyer was also detained along with other suspects during one of the raids, but he was released after preliminary investigations cleared him of any wrongdoing. He said that security forces’ actions are ongoing to maintain law and order across Balochistan.
 
 

“We have already made it clear that operations are being conducted in grey areas, where identifying adversaries is not easy,” he said.
He further said that peace and stability cannot be achieved by security forces alone and it requires joint efforts from all sections of society.
“No innocent person will be wronged, as questioning and investigations are part of the legal process,” he added.
The provincial government, Mr Rind said, will continue its efforts to restore peace and security in the province.

• PM, army chief interact with flood-hit people in Buner
• Shehbaz blames ‘human blunder’ of unregulated construction for worsening rain destruction
• Tells Centre & provinces to join hands on disaster, reforestation, and construction policies
• Over 20 killed as rains lash Karachi, Gilgit-Baltistan
BUNER: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday directed federal and provincial authorities to formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones, as he blamed the unregulated construction in “hazardous areas” for an increase in the damages caused by floods.
He made these remarks during his visit to Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where he addressed the flood victims and promised to utilise all resources for their relief and rehabilitation. The premier described floods, triggered by heavy rains and mountain torrents carrying rocks and debris, as “a doomsday of sorts” for the affected communities.
“More than 350 of our brothers and sisters have lost their lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone, while nationwide, over 700 lives have been claimed by this tragedy,” he said, adding that hundreds remained injured or missing.
 


Meanwhile, more than 20 people were killed on Wednesday in a torrential spell of monsoon rain across the country, as downpours have swept away entire villages over the last week, leaving more than 400 dead, AFP reported.
The KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said that the death toll from the floods across the province surged to 385, while 182 others were injured. It said Buner recorded the highest number of 228 deaths, while Swabi recorded 41 deaths.
Recalling the catastrophic floods of 2022, PM Shehbaz stressed that lessons had not been learned, particularly regarding construction in hazardous areas. He criticised the building of hotels and houses on riverbanks and floodplains, terming it a “human blunder” that had worsened the scale of destruction.
“There is no law anywhere in the world that allows construction in such dangerous places,” he said, warning that further spells of heavy rains were expected before September 10.
 
 

The PM directed federal and provincial authorities to immediately formulate policies to ban construction in flood-prone zones. He said he would convene a meeting of all chief ministers and their chief secretaries to make joint decisions on disaster preparedness, reforestation, and regulation of construction.
“If we continue to allow influence and corruption to dictate building permits, then neither the people nor the governments will be forgiven,” he remarked.
Relief measures
He also announced emergency relief measures, including the restoration of electricity in flood-affected districts. He said 37 of the 47 damaged feeders in Buner and Swat had already been made functional and ordered that electricity supply be provided for one week, regardless of the bill payment history. He added Gilgit-Baltistan and KP were also being repaired on priority.
 
 

Emphasising the role of deforestation in worsening the floods, the prime minister urged strict action against indiscriminate tree-cutting in KP. “If the trees had remained, they would have helped hold back water and rocks,” he said, calling for a ‘national movement’ to stop deforestation and protect natural resources.
He lauded the efforts of the KP government, the Pakistan Army under Field Marshal Asim Munir, civil administration, and local relief organisations in assisting victims. He highlighted the dual challenge of external threats and natural disasters faced by the country, praising security forces for their service.
He also announced civil awards for public servants, such as Zahoor Ahmed, a teacher who lost his life while rescuing children during the floods.
Concluding his visit, the PM urged unity and collective responsibility in the face of recurring climate disasters. “Our limited resources must be spent wisely, on education, health, and sustainable infrastructure, not on repairing preventable destruction again and again,” he said.
A statement issued regarding his visit quoted the PM as saying that Pakistan must act as “a hard state where no one is above law” and necessary actions be taken against defaulters without distinction.
The statement said the premier and army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir received a comprehensive briefing on the ongoing rescue and relief operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The COAS also interacted with troops, police and civil administration personnel involved in rescue efforts, lauding their selfless commitment in assisting victims of floods and torrential rains. He directed ground formations to approach this responsibility with devotion and spare no effort in alleviating the hardships of flood-affected families.

This initiative marks a key milestone in the ongoing development of Pakistan’s financial market infrastructure.
The launch event, held at the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), was attended by CEOs of banks, microfinance institutions, payment system operators, payment service providers, senior SBP officials, and other industry stakeholders.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed highlighted that PRISM+ aligns with the central bank’s Vision 2028, aiming to bolster Pakistan’s digital financial infrastructure. With PRISM+, Pakistan joins a select group of countries adopting the ISO 20022 global messaging standard for both retail and large-value payment systems.
Built on advanced standards, PRISM+ offers enhanced functionality, including structured financial messaging, improved interoperability, and greater transparency.
The system also introduces innovative features such as real-time liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, future-dated payments, and seamless integration with the Central Securities Depository (CSD) for auctions, repos, and monetary operations.

Addressing the Auto Parts Summit 2025, organised by the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Mr Akhtar outlined a vision for a thriving domestic automotive industry.
“The new tariff policy coupled with a new industrial policy and regulatory reforms, along with the plan to revive certain sick industries such as the steel mills, will prove that the future of Pakistan’s automotive industry is bright,” he said. He assured local manufacturers that the government would stand by them, adding, “But we want you to be competitive, and we will help you.”
In a move to level the playing field, the SAPM assured auto parts makers that quality standards applicable to local manufacturing will also be strictly implemented on imported parts and vehicles.
However, industry stakeholders voiced significant concerns over government policies they see as detrimental to local enterprise. Paapam Chairman Usman Malik highlighted the challenges posed by the commercial import of used cars, arguing it undermines the local industry.

Local parts makers decry used car imports

He pointed out the apparent contradiction in the government’s approach, which promotes an environmentally friendly electric vehicle policy while simultaneously allowing the import of used petrol and diesel engine cars.
Mr Malik warned that such imports threaten to “destroy” local auto parts manufacturers, who currently supply 70pc of parts for cars and 90pc for motorcycles. He stressed that this would also negatively impact local employment.
Despite these challenges, the domestic auto parts industry demonstrates considerable potential, with annual exports reaching around $200 million, according to Mr Malik. He noted that these locally manufactured parts adhere to international safety standards, and that Pakistan’s Millat Tractors are being exported to the US.

The finance division issued a notification suggesting the withdrawal of a directive for cabinet members to donate a month’s salary.
However, another notification from the same division stated that the one-day pay of senior bureaucrats from Grades 19 to 22 will be donated to the flood victims.
Meanwhile, officials at the Prime Minister’s Office clarified that the decision to donate one month’s salary of cabinet members has not been withdrawn, and that their salaries will be donated to the flood-hit people through another notification issued by the cabinet division.
The cabinet division’s notification said: “The prime minister has been pleased to direct that all federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers and special assistants to the prime minister shall contribute one month’s salary for flood relief.”
A senior official at the Prime Minister’s Office said the apparent contradiction stemmed from the fact that the finance division deals with the salaries of bureaucrats, while the cabinet division oversees the salaries and perks of cabinet members.
 
 

“Although the finance division’s notification gave the impression that the prime minister’s announ­ce­ment had been withdrawn, ministers will definitely donate their monthly pay to the flood victims,” the official said.
Another notification from the finance division clarified that contributions would be calculated on gross pay and allowances before deductions and would not be included in the taxable emoluments of officers and officials.
