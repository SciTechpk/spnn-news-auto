Last week, PDMA alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.
Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.
 
 

According to the report, a total of three houses were partially damaged due to rain and flash floods. The PDMA has directed the relevant administrations to provide immediate assistance to the bereaved families and remain on high alert in case of an emergency.
According to the KP PDMA spokesperson, the authority was in touch with all district administrations and relief agencies. He added that PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre was fully functional and urged the public to report any untoward incident on their helpline 1700.
The PDMA, in its countrywide weather advisory, warned that there was a risk of flooding in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Muree, Galiat, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Swabi, Nowshera, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, DG Khan, North East Punjab, Balochistan and Kashmir as heavy rains continue.
According to the report, there was a risk of landslide due to the rain in KP, Murree, Galiat, Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, which may disrupt traffic movement.
PDMA advised citizens to exercise caution, as damaged infrastructure could pose a threat to public safety.
Low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar may face flooding as well, the report said.
In the past 24 hours, the highest rainfall was recorded in Punjab with Okara receiving 72 millimetres of rain while Sahiwal recorded 66mm, Dera Ghazi Khan City 51mm, Bahawalnagar 36mm, Kot Addu 33mm, Gujranwala 12mm, Noorpur Thal 27mm, Karr (Leh) 23mm, Murree 22, Khanpur 13, Bhakkar 09, Islamabad (Bokra 9mm, Airport 7mm, Saidpur 4mm), Rawalpindi (Kachri 12mm, Chaklala 6mm, Peerewadahi 7mm), Jhang 6mm, Attock and Hafizabad 4mm, TT Singh and Sheikhupura 2mm.
In KP, the highest rainfall was recorded in Saidu Sharif at 28mm while the rest of the districts received: Mir Khani 20mm, Kalam 17mm, Malam Jabba 15mm, Takht Bai 13mm, Dir 12mm, D.I. Khan 14mm, Peshawar 13mm, Drosh 6mm, Kakul, Pattan, Cherat 5mm, Balakot 3mm, Bannu 1mm.

The weather in other parts of the country remained hot and humid. The maximum temperature recorded was 43 degrees Celsius in Jacobabad, Rohri, Dadu, Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh and Dalbandin in Balochistan.
No chance of heavy rain in Karachi: PMD
Meanwhile, the weather in Karachi is expected to remain cloudy with a chance of light drizzle, according to a weather advisory issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday.
On July 14, the metropolitan city is to experience “mostly cloudy & humid” weather with chances of drizzle/light rain. The temperature will remain between 33 – 35 degrees Celsius while the humidity level is expected to reach 70 per cent.
On July 15 and 16, the weather will remain “partly cloudy & humid with chances of drizzle during night/morning”. The temperature is expected to be between 33-35 degrees Celsius, and the humidity level will be at 70-80pc.

Wearing a navy blue uniform, the security guard leaves his house near Ziauddin Hospital in Clifton right after Fajr prayer to walk the 10-kilometre stretch to his workplace in Saddar. It takes him two hours every day to reach on time for a job that pays a meagre Rs25,000 each month.
By noon, the humidity forces him to take off his sweat-drenched shirt and dry it off by placing it in front of the shabby fan available in the parking area of his office building. This is also when he steals some time to cool off in front of the same fan.
At around 7 pm, it is time for him to walk another two hours back to his one-room apartment that he shares with his family of five.
“I have to pay Rs7,000 rent from my salary for the room, but we get by,” he said, with a smile, a permanent fixture on his otherwise worn face.
Asadullah is not even aware that what he is earning is 33 per cent below the minimum wage fixed by the Government of Pakistan. The federal minimum wage was set at Rs37,000 for the outgoing fiscal year of 2024-2025, according to the 2024 notification, which had increased by 15.6pc from the previous year. For the current fiscal year 2025-2026, the government decided to maintain the minimum wage at Rs37,000.
 
 

According to the Sindh Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC), over 80pc of private industrial units are not implementing the order of minimum wage.
“Around 95pc of factories do not give minimum wage to their workers,” Nasir Mansoor, General Secretary of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), told Dawn.com.
Asadullah, completely alien to his right to demand the minimum wage, said that his employer increased his salary whenever he requested it. When asked what he thought his rightful salary was, he replied: “Maybe Rs30,000?”
Pakistan is heavily dependent on its labour class economically, yet the country has not been able to give due weight and importance to the rights and interests of its labourers, according to a 2019 Sindh High Court-commissioned report.
“The ‘industry’ of a nation is always the backbone of its economy, which normally depends upon the labour class,” the report highlighted.
‘Wage theft’
Seated in a cramped, 5x5ft room with dark brown walls, where the breeze from the windows offered the only relief from Karachi’s scorching heat and humidity, Manesh Das* wore a ferozi-coloured kurta, stained with patches of brown that had almost altered its original hue. His kurta was drenched in sweat, and his brown skin glistened with it.
Das had left his family of six — his wife and children — with his parents and siblings in Tando Mohammad Khan four to five months ago, hoping to break free from the shackles of the zamindar he once worked for, who paid him only in crops, never in money. Kumar had believed that moving to the city would at least allow him to send some money back home.
But from his meagre salary of Rs15,600 received in weekly instalments — earned by sweeping roughly a one-kilometre stretch in Ranchor Line every day from 8am to 3pm — he is only able to send Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 home.
“Even going home costs almost Rs4,000 to Rs5,000, which we cannot afford,” he said.
 


Labour rights activist Naeem Sadiq, during an interview with Dawn.com, explained that the national minimum wage for unskilled workers is set at Rs37,000 for an 8-hour daily shift, for working 26 days per month (the wages slightly vary by skill level and province). If a worker puts in overtime, they are entitled to receive double their regular hourly wage.
Citing the example of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB), where Das is currently employed, Sadiq calculated approximately Rs2.4 billion in annual wage theft by the institution.
According to the rights activist, the SSWMB employs 12,000 sanitation workers. Each employee is paid approximately Rs20,000 per month, which means there was a Rs17,000 worth of stolen wages from each employee per month, entailing that each worker is owed Rs200,000 just for the year 2024-25.
“Now imagine Rs17,000 being stolen per person per month for 12,000 people. It comes to Rs2.4 billion per year. So, Rs2.4 billion is being distributed among the top guys as a bribe. Not as a bribe, as stealing, as wage theft.”
For his part, Tariq Ali Nizamani, the SSWMB’s managing director, told Dawn.com that the board is currently responsible for managing waste for 70pc of Karachi, for which they have approximately 10,000 people as part of the sanitation force, and another 5000 workers comprising their drivers, helpers, and on-ground management staff.
The SSWMB hires these workers through a third party. According to Nizamani, they direct the contractors to pay the minimum wage set by the government. He was positive that they pay this amount to the workers on the street, as they have methods to ensure that.
“We have an in-house committee; our officers and the assistant director work in the zone. The deputy director is working in the district. Plus, we have not received any such complaint that they are getting less salary.”
But the ground realities narrate a different story.
Hussain Amir*, a resident of Lyari, works as a rickshaw driver for a company contracted by the SSWMB. Before he was fired for complaining, he earned Rs32,000 while driving a garbage truck. As a result of that complaint a few months ago, he was dismissed. After much pleading, he has managed to return to the same company—this time as a rickshaw driver—on a reduced salary, and now earns a mere Rs25,000.
Das, the sweeper, could only partially speak Urdu, but one thing he made sure to communicate clearly was that he did not want his name or picture included in the story — as there had been cases of workers being fired for complaining.
“They do not issue any contractual letters to workers to prevent them from unionising — because if they do, we will help them file complaints and ensure their contractors abide by the law,” Zulfiqar Shah, Chairman of the All Pakistan Local Government Workers Federation, told Dawn.com.
Karachi South is under contract with a Turkish company, Aysis, Shah added — a detail that was also confirmed by Nizamani.
 
 

According to Shah, sweepers and drivers like Das and Abid have been hired through fourth- and fifth-party contractors.
“The companies have resorted to petty contracting — asking their people to recruit groups of workers to make up the required labour force.”
Das’s fellow sweeper, Karim Akash*, comes from a village in Hyderabad. Like Das, he finds any space he can at the Karachi Metropoltian Cooperation (KMC) workshop to sleep, and relies on Saylani Welfare Trust for food. He confirmed that there is no written agreement with the person who hired them.
“I was told about this job by a contractor in my village, who then connected me with a contractor here.”
“Every morning, he [the contractor] takes our picture to mark attendance. A supervisor comes to count the number of workers. He [the supervisor] gives the money to the contractor, and we are paid in cash every week,” Akash added.

When Dawn.com reached out to Nizamani again after receiving this information, he again mentioned that there have been no direct complaints, however, they have received some indirect complaints due to which they are already talking to contractors about putting the sanitation workers on a payroll.
He also requested Dawn.com to speak to him after reading a write-up by the board which said, “The SSWMB had made contracts for provision of sanitation services with the international companies registered in Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).”
“The said contracts are clear that the SSWMB will pay the companies for their verified provided services as per the contract and shall impose penalties for any highlighted negligence as prescribed in the contracts.”
The write-up elaborated that the, “SSWMB has neither hired directly or indirectly any sanitation worker nor paid any wages to any sanitation worker. The companies being in service contract with SSWMB are being paid for the services which they provide under the Service Contract Agreements, and companies are bound to abide all prevailing laws of the Government.”
“Such allegation over SSWMB regarding payment of mere pittance to sanitation workers of Karachi and Hyderabad who work as third party daily wagers is denied,” it stated.
Is minimum wage enough?
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), a monthly income of over Rs75,000 is required to support a family of six with basic necessities such as food, housing, utilities, healthcare and education.
The HRCP has urged that wages must reflect the principle that “full-time workers should be able to live with security, health and hope,” as the government prepared to announce the federal budget of the upcoming fiscal year 2025-2026.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) also demanded a raise in minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs50,000 prior to the budget announcement.
Citing a World Bank report, PPP’s Labour Bureau Head Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed said that 44pc of the population is living below the poverty line and called for better health facilities for industrial workers and an increase in their death and marriage grants.
Hina Amin*, a machine operator at a denim manufacturing factory in Korangi’s industrial area, doesn’t even care for a raise. Before even waiting to hear the full question about her wage, she started expressing her frustration regarding the untimely payment of salary.
“Why do people work? You tell me. They work for a livelihood.” Amin exclaimed.
“Believe me, we have to fight and protest for our month’s salary. If we protest, we are thrown out,” she added.
Amin is salaried at the minimum wage of Rs37,000. She spends at least Rs60 daily travelling to and from work, in addition to her rent, bills, and grocery. Since the factory does not have a canteen, the workers have to manage their food as well. Sometimes, even when a worker scheduled for a 9am to 6pm shift arrives a few minutes before 9, they are still marked late — resulting in a further deduction from their salary.
When asked if she had tried to request a higher salary to make ends meet, she complained that the workers were already not receiving their salaries on time, which was her primary concern.
“First, they should at least give us our salaries on time so that we don’t have to take loans to pay our rents. Then comes the topic of salary increase,” she stated.
“If we say anything, they will kick us out […] we are helpless,” she added.
Sadiq echoed Amin’s thoughts on the matter. He said that in an ideal world, the minimum wage should be at least Rs60,000. “We should and we will certainly push for those wages.”
However, “this discussion should normally begin after workers are getting what is already the minimum wage,” he stressed.
“Sadly, right now, we are fighting for every morsel and every breath.”
‘There is no way to save them’
So who decides what the minimum wage should be? Who ensures it is abided by? And whom does one turn to when it’s not?
Labour law expert, Danish Nayyer, explained that following the 18th Amendment, labour laws were devolved to the provinces. Now, all provinces have their own laws and procedures for declaring and implementing minimum wages.
Nayyer told Dawn.com that in Sindh, the Sindh Minimum Wages Act, 2015 governed the area. In pursuance of the Act, the Labour and Human Resources Department of the provincial government declared the minimum wage. Currently, the minimum wage for unskilled workers is fixed at Rs37,000, similar to the federal level.

Last year, following the announcement of the budget for 2024-2025, Public Accounts Committee Chairman Nisar Ahmed Khuhro admitted to the violation of labours laws and directed the Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (SESSI) and the labour department to strictly implement the policy of providing the minimum monthly wage to all workers across the province after reviewing the audit reports of SESSI for the years 2018 and 2019.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SESSI commissioner, Miandad Rahoojo, explained that the institution has around 780,000 registered workers, all of whom are receiving at least the minimum wage. The commissioner admitted, however, to a mass violation of minimum wage laws across Sindh, including some “serious” cases of violations, especially at brick kilns where the lives of workers resemble “the worst form of slavery”.
“Even pre-Islamic times were not as bad as this,” he lamented.
Rahoojo said, however, that the responsibility of ensuring the implementation of wage laws and of maintaining a complete digital base for it is on the Labour Department, clarifying that SESSI does not cater to any complaints regarding the violation of the law either.
“SESSI doesn’t cater to these complaints. There is a minimum wage board, which announces [the wage] and the labour department ensures its implementation. SESSI only registers the workers who get the minimum wage. In a way, SESSI has a role in the reactive way.”
The secretary of the Minimum Wage Board, Naeem Mangi, had a similar response.
“When it comes to the question of implementation, it is the responsibility of the labour department; we only fix the minimum wages,” he concurred.
He said their board often received complaints through the PM’s Portal regarding violation of the minimum wage law; however, if the investigation starts, the company would usually fire that employee.
“There is no way to save them.”
Where to file a complaint?
NTUF General Secretary Mansoor told Dawn.com that one can complain against the employer to the joint director of the labour department. “There is no cost of complaint.”
However, there is no helpline for complaints or any awareness campaigns for employees like Asadullah and Haq to educate them on their rights and processes to raise their voice in the case of violation of their rights.
The lawyer, Nayyer, explained that under the Sindh Payment of Minimum Wage Act, if an employee wants to report a case of underpayment, they must file a complaint to the Payment of Wages Authority.
“There is no helpline with respect to filing any complaint; the complaint has to be made in writing and filed before the authority,” Nayyer stated.
“The employee can either file the complaint directly in their personal capacity, for which there are no costs, or they can choose to file the complaint through a lawyer; the legal fee varies from lawyer to lawyer.”
Nayyer added that the authority writes to the employer once they have received a complaint.
As to who would act as the final arbiter in this scenario, the the Sindh Minimum Wage Act 2015 states: “Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, appoint any person to be authority for any area, specified in the notification, to hear and decide all claims arising out of non- payment, or delay in the payment of wages to workers in that area whose minimum rates of wages have been declared under the provisions of this Act.”
“Both parties then get the right to a hearing, they can make the employer pay you a minimum wage and can pass an order,” Nayyer elaborated.
“Under the Sindh Minimum Wages Act 2015 and its rules, the Sindh Minimum Wages Rules, 2021, the Authority has the powers under the Sindh Land Revenue Act, 1976 to seize or attach bank accounts of employers in case they do not comply with the payment of minimum wages,” Nayyer elaborated.
As per the Sindh Minimum Wage Act 2015, Section 9(3):
“Any employer who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees but not less than twenty thousand rupees or with both, in addition to payment of sum not less than the difference in wages actually paid to the worker and the amount which would have been paid to him had there been no such contravention.”
Inspecting violation
Awais Ali Chandio, a machine operator at a denim manufacturing factory in Karachi’s Korangi, is salaried at Rs37,000 but must put in at least 50 hours overtime per month to meet his family’s needs. Luckily, since he is a company employee, he gets double his hourly rate — Rs300 per hour — until he works 50 hours as overtime per month. Beyond that, he receives the usual Rs150 for each hour of overtime work.
Unfortunately, though, the contractual employees at his company do not share the same perks despite fulfilling the same duties as Chandio’s.
“They get paid somewhere between Rs28,000 to Rs32,000; their overtime rate is also just Rs100 per hour,” said Chandio.
Although it is not company policy, employees at Chandio’s workplace are still hired on a contractual basis.
“The management pulls this off to fill their stomachs. This way, they are able to make at least Rs20,000 per employee,” he said, while criticising the managers, adding that the company had around 200 to 250 contractual employees hidden among a few thousand company employees.
The question is, who is in charge of pointing out such practices and putting an end to them?
As per the 2019 SHC report, in order to monitor “whether application of minimum wage has been observed as set down by the Government of Sindh, the inspectors had been appointed under section 14 of the Act 2015.”
It elaborated on the inspection system.
“The purpose of appointing inspectors is to carry out inspections under Rule 22 of the West Pakistan Minimum Wages Rules 1962 which states, that if any inspector during the inspection detects any irregularity on the part of employer, they should advise management of the establishment to rectify the same and in case of further violation of minimum wage laws, such establishments should be prosecuted in the Court of Law.
“During the visits of [the] Commission across Sindh, it was observed that several posts of inspectors within the meaning of Section 14 of the Act 2015, were lying vacant,” the report said.
It added that, “When it was asked of the Secretary Labour Department and the Chairman Minimum Board as to whether any violation of minimum wages had been detected, they denied the fact regarding the violation of Sindh Minimum Wages Act.”
“In case of any violation of Minimum Wages, such establishments are prosecuted in the court of law,” the report cited Saeed Saleh Jumani, Incharge Chairman Minimum Wage Board.
“Labour inspector, labour officer, assistant director, director, deputy director and joint director go to factories and organisations to implement wage laws […] only they know what happens then,” Mangi commented.
Why the ‘poor implementation’?
For civil rights activist and lawyer, Jibran Nasir, workers’ rights remain poorly protected in Sindh due to systemic failures of both the Labour Department and SESSI.
He highlighted SESSI’s failure in recovering over Rs500 million in outstanding dues from employers and “eroding employees’ trust” by ignoring reimbursement claims of medical expenses by employees for three years.
Jibran also criticised the Labour Department for not producing records of any formal complaints regarding non-payment of minimum wage, despite widespread evidence of violations. “It also failed to present even a record of complaints received, reflecting weak enforcement and worker fear. There is no updated or integrated database of workers or businesses, severely limiting oversight,” he said.
Each year, the federal government releases a notification updating the minimum wage after the budget release, often only after much pressure from trade unions and activists, said Sadiq. This alone speaks volumes of the authorities’ priorities when it comes to those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.
“People like me often push for the notification after the budget is released, as the minimum wage notification is often missing,” said Sadiq. “Ultimately, the minimum wage notification is issued somewhere in September.”
Sporadically, the government runs campaigns to implement minimum wage laws and spread awareness. According to SESSI’s Rahoojo, his department has run several awareness campaigns over the years. “We have launched a campaign for awareness. We are meeting every trade association to ask them to register employees,” he said. The employers, however, usually resist registering the workers and paying them minimum wage, he added.
“If the employer has 1,000 workers, he would register 50 of them. This is discrimination,” he lamented.
 
 

For Jibran Nasir though, this is all a hogwash. “Annual increases in minimum wage appear more performative than impactful, as poor implementation, official apathy, and corruption prevent these measures from translating into real benefits,” he said, marking it as the main reason workers remain largely unprotected and excluded from basic legal entitlements.
Challenges faced by the industry
At a post-budget press conference last month, Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, when questioned on giving a 10pc raise to civil servants while maintaining status quo on the minimum wage in the current fiscal year, requested to raise this question with industrial associations and “get their feedback on it.”
He mentioned the industry’s “big question on formal versus informal sector” and linked the question of minimum wage with industry competitiveness.
“I think at this point, we are at a good place with minimum wage,” he added.
The industry, it appears, seems to agree with him. According to federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s Marketing Director Faizul Haq, it is important to apply these laws in a gradual, phased and “realistic fashion” by keeping account of the ground realities and the capacity of businesses, “specifically small, medium enterprises to pay their labour.”
“The main point here primarily concerns the cost of doing business, and wages are an important and significant component of the same.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the Chief Financial Officer of a major export company told Dawn.com that while the objective behind minimum wage laws is good, which is to improve the lives of the workers, lawmakers need to think about demand in the economic engine in the “real sense”.
“Businesses, especially the labour-intensive ones, are facing challenges due to a slowdown in demand. So, policy makers also need to think about creating an enabling environment.”
Faizul, on the other hand, while explaining the cyclical nature of business, highlighted the drawbacks of not factoring in economic compulsions while fixing minimum wages.
“If you burden the businesses, the ultimate cost would be paid by the consumers, and it would result in inflation because if the products or services are costlier, the cost would ultimately be transferred to the end consumers.”
“The whole cycle needs to be understood, and it has to be done in consultation with the business community.” He emphasised the importance of dealing with this issue, keeping in mind the economic outcomes instead of the political ones.
“We have to understand that this is an economic question rather than a political question […] this is a cycle and this cycle needs to be understood in a phased and logical manner.”
For the security guard Asadullah and millions like him, the wrangling between the industrialists and the government holds little meaning. He will likely continue to work for a pittance, as authorities and business owners continue to point fingers, with little thought or concern for the plight of workers who find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet even if they are lucky to get minimum wage.

The stock market resumed trading at 134,299.76 points and gained 1,170 points in early trading to cross the 135,000 points barrier. The benchmark KSE-100 gained 1841.11 points (1.37pc), and is currently trading at 136,119.27 points as of 12:15pm. The total volume of shares traded is 134,882,053 with a value of Rs 11.12 billion.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction as the stock market surged to cross the all-time high level.
According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, he said the “significant achievement by the PSX is a clear reflection of the business community’s growing confidence in Pakistan’s economy.”
“The recent positive economic indicators are a testament to his government’s policies moving in the right direction,” he emphasised, reiterating that providing a business-friendly environment remains the government’s top priority.“
He said the country had moved from economic stability towards the path of economic growth, adding that the government of Pakistan was working tirelessly for national development and public welfare.
“This positive outlook follows a period of concerted efforts to stabilise the economy and implement structural reforms, which appear to be gaining traction and restoring investor trust,” he said, per the statement.
The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.
A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.
Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.
The auto sector further supported market gains. As per the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales in June rose 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month to 21,773 units.

Pelicot earned international tributes for her courage in testifying at a trial in 2024 against her former husband, who drugged her and arranged for her to be raped by dozens of men over a decade.
She has since been named on lists of the world’s most influential people by international media and the case helped force a change in France’s rape law.
But Pelicot has remained silent since the trial. Her lawyer says she is concentrating on writing a book giving her side of the mass rape story which is to be released in 2026.
 






Williams, 52, made his name as a rapper and singer but earned a second fortune as a music producer and after designing clothes and accessories for several brands. He has been Louis Vuitton’s men’s creative director since 2023.
His recent Paris show attracted a host of international celebrities, including Jay Z and Beyonce, film directors Steve McQueen and Spike Lee and football and basketball stars.
Actor Lea Drucker, veteran singer Sylvie Vartan, writer Marc Levy and Auschwitz deportee Yvette Levy, 99, were also among the figures awarded the Legion of Honour along with a host of former ministers, academics and top legal names.</p><small>2025-07-14 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1411571581c133a.jpg?r=115719' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924039/woman-throws-herself-two-minor-sons-in-front-of-train-in-sahiwal' target='_blank'><strong>Woman throws herself, two minor sons in front of train in Sahiwal</strong></a><br><p>SAHIWAL: An unidentified young woman, along with her two minor children, allegedly died after she threw herself and the kids in front of a running goods train near Ashiana Housing Society, Jhal Road, in the early hours of Sunday.
Eyewitnesses informed police that the woman, along with her minor sons, aged one and three years, was walking along the Lahore-Karachi railway track.
They said that despite being warned of the approaching goods train by a passerby, the woman wrapped her arms around the children and jumped onto the track. All of them were run over by the train and died instantly.
Teams of Railway police, Ghala Mandi police and Rescue 1122 reached the spot and collected evidence and recorded witnesses’ statements, while Rescue 1122 staff shifted the bodies to the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.
Police are trying to ascertain the identity of the deceased woman.
Ghala Mandi police Sub Inspector Imtiaz says that woman’s fingerprints have been sent to Nadra Lahore office for identification. SHO Mr Amjad said that announcements were made in nearby localities through mosques, besides issuance of handouts to local social media platforms, asking the public to share information, if any, about the deceased woman.
POISONED: A commission agent was allegedly poisoned to death by his friend for demanding back Rs1.2m he had lent to the suspect at 69/12-L village of Chichawatni.
As per police, Bashir Ahmed had lent Rs1.2m to his friend Ranjha last year.
When Bashir demanded his money back, Ranjha appeared reluctant. However, on being pushed by Bashir, Ranjha invited him to his house to return the amount.
When Bashir arrived at his house, with his maternal uncle Qadir Bakish, Ranjha was present there along with Mukhtar and an unknown man.
During the meeting, tea was served. Before taking tea, Qadir went out to buy cigarettes. When he was returning, he saw Ranjha, Mukhtar and their friend fleeing the house, where he found Bashir vomiting blood. He died instantly. The police say that initial investigations show that he was poisoned. An FIR has been registered, but no arrest has been made so far.

Special Court (CNS) Judge Rajesh Chander Rajput convicted accused Nakawa Edihi of the offence punishable under Section 9 (1) 7 (b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).
According to state prosecutor Abdul Hannan, the accused arrived in Pakistan in January after allegedly concealing 11 capsules containing 144 gram of cocaine in her stomach. She was apprehended by an Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) team at the Jinnah International Airport.
However, when she appeared before the court for framing of formal charges, she voluntarily pleaded guilty and prayed for mercy. On her admission, the court recorded her statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), in which she confessed to the offence.

Court takes a lenient view in handing down jail term after accused pleads guilty

“I have heard the accused have thoroughly gone through the record of the case. During framing of formal charge, accused has admitted her guilt of attempt to import 11 capsules having 144 gram of ‘cocaine’ concealed in her body cavity to Pakistan,” the judge noted.
Reasoning for lesser punishment, the court observed that the accused has repeatedly pleaded guilty by “detailing her poor financial circumstances and from her demeanor”.
“This court has concluded that her admission of guilt was voluntarily and free from any coercion whatsoever from any corner,” it added.
In her statement before the court, the accused deposed that she was a single mother of two minor children and was facing financial constraints to meet her daily expenses as she was also a diabetic patient hence, she committed this crime.
She further claimed to be the first offender and nothing was available in the investigation papers to suggest that she was a previous convict.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs50,000, on default she would have to serve additional imprisonment for five days.
According to prosecutor Hannan, a Nigerian national, Stephen Chubuike, was in contact with the prime accused. Later, he was apprehended and bail was granted to him as nothing was recovered from his possession.
However, at the hearing, he failed to appear before the court as a result the court cancelled his surety bond and issued non-bailable warrant for his arrest.
A case was registered at the ANF Clifton station under Section 9(1) 7(b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).

• Traffic police using new number plates campaign as a ‘trap for bribery’, alleges Monem Zafar
• Muttahida urges review of fees, seeks mobile camps to ease process
KARACHI: The criticism by the opposition parties against a government move to replace vehicle number plates with new Ajrak-themed designs and allow traffic police to issue hefty fines against ordinary people gained momentum as they demanded that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stop law enforcers from taking extreme action and waive the fees for the new number plates.
On Sunday, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) organised a “bike rally” and hundreds of motorcyclists took to the streets, protesting against the PPP government and accusing it of “enabling corruption and creating new opportunities for law enforcement officials to demand bribes”.
The protesters also questioned the priorities and policies of the provincial government, accusing it of “failing” to provide basic necessities and essential public services while focusing instead on vehicle registration plates.
The bike rally kicked off from Five Star Chowrangi in North Nazimabad and concluded near Fresco Chowk, off Burns Road, drawing a large crowd, with the majority of participants being young riders.
Addressing the participants, the JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar strongly lambasted the PPP government over its “wrongful” approach and priorities aimed at “minting money”, instead of bringing some ease to Karachiites.
“The Karachiites are facing multiple daily life crises. They are facing acute water shortage, the roads in the city are broken, garbage has become a big issue and health risk in a large number of areas. There are only 400 buses for 35 million people, infrastructure has gone, load-shedding is still a problem in several towns, but the PPP government has chosen number plates to keep its focus on,” he added.
In this backdrop, he said, bikers were halted at every nook and corner of the city, and the number plates campaign was being used as a “trap for bribery” by the “corrupt” elements in the traffic police.
He urged the government to reconsider its decision and immediately halt the campaign, warning that failure to do so would provoke a strong public protest from the people of Karachi.
The growing controversy over the fresh campaign of the government and the imposition of a new fee for culturally-themed plates has started attracting criticism from almost all political parties in Karachi.
Muttahida demands review of fee
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has directed its Sindh Assembly members to urgently meet with the provincial Excise Minister to address the public’s concerns.
In a statement, the MQM-P central committee highlighted that over 3.3 million motorcycles and 2.3 million vehicles are registered in Karachi, yet their owners — despite applying and paying online — are not receiving number plates on time.
“Complaints remain unresolved, and citizens face harassment from traffic police for not displaying plates, even though they have already paid the required fee during registration,” it said.
The party demanded that mobile camps be set up on main roads for plate distribution and that plates be couriered directly to applicants, to eliminate long queues and exploitation by agents.
It has also called for a review of the plate fees and rebates for those who have already paid under the old system.
Afaq calls it ‘Ajrak tax’
Separately, Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM-Haqiqi) chairman Afaq Ahmed strongly condemned the Sindh government’s decision to issue new Ajrak-themed number plates for motorcycles, charging Rs1,850 per vehicle.
Calling it a discriminatory “Ajrak tax,” he warned that such policies could lead to dangerous ethnic divisions within the province.
“We do not want Sindh’s division, but if this injustice continues, a strong public reaction is inevitable,” he said.
He also accused the Sindh government of treating Karachi like a “colony”, “exploiting” its resources while “denying” residents basic infrastructure, transport, education and law enforcement.
He demanded equal compensation for victims of traffic accidents in Karachi, similar to that provided in interior Sindh.

• Legislation says shift necessitated by ‘changing dynamics of national security’; allows for countrywide deployment of Federal Constabulary
• Force to have dedicated division for special protection and riot control
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC), a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance, the Law and Justice Division issued an official notification to this effect. According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories.
However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.
“As the Senate and the National Assembly are not in session and the President of the Islamic Repu­blic of Pakistan is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate act­ion,” the ordinance said. The ordi­nance called the Frontier Cons­tabulary (Re-organization) Ordi­nance, 2025, came into force at once.
A former interior secretary told Dawn that the ordinance gave complete and legitimate authority to the federal government to use FC across the country and for any purpose, in the name of security.
He said the Frontier Consta­bulary was first deployed in Kara­chi about 25 years ago and then it was used in the federal capital. Later, it was deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan for the protection of the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and major dam projects.
Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.
The ordinance said that the force would be headed by an inspector general to be appointed by the federal government. The FC, it said, be used as a reserve force, to perform specialised duties in aid of the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, provincial police forces, and other security and law enforcement forces and agencies.
The Federal Constabulary shall be under the overall command of the inspector general, who shall be assisted by additional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and assistant inspectors general and such other officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), as may be appointed in the prescribed manner. It shall comprise two divisions, namely the Security Division and the Federal Reserve Division.
The structure of the Federal Constabulary shall comprise wings, companies and platoons, commanded by officers of the rank of superintendent of police, assistant superintendent of police, or deputy superintendent of police, inspector, sub-inspector, and assistant sub-inspector, respectively.
 
 

The FC’s Security Division shall comprise the existing strength of the Frontier Constabulary and shall consist exclusively of the personnel appointed through the traditional system as prescribed by regulations.
There shall be a dedicated division for anti-riot and special protection in the Federal Constabulary called the Federal Reserve Division. The Federal Constabulary shall have the powers as enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the Police Order, 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order No. 22 of 2002) and any other law for the time being in force.
Shifting all powers
In addition to such powers, the federal government may, by general or special order, confer or impose upon any member of the Federal Constabulary any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed on a police officer of any class or grade by any enactment for the time being in force.
The ordinance also shifts all powers and assets of the Frontier Constabulary to the Federal Constabulary, as it said: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force all members and employees of the Frontier Constabulary serving in the defunct Frontier Constabulary immediately before the commencement of this ordinance, immediately after the commencement of this ordinance shall stands transferred to the Federal Constabulary reconstituted under this ordinance on same terms and conditions as applicable to them before commencement of this ordinance.”
“All assets and liabilities of the Frontier Constabulary, of whatever nature and wherever situated, shall, upon commencement of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance stand transferred to and vest in the Federal Constabulary,” it added.
“All rules, regulations, notifications, and orders made or issued under the Frontier Constabulary Act, 1915, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of the Federal Constabulary,” the ordinance said.

Bitcoin scaled a record high of $121,207.55 in the Asian session on Monday, before pulling back slightly to last trade 1.6 per cent higher at $121,015.42.
Starting today, the US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide the digital asset industry with the nation’s regulatory framework it has long demanded.
Those demands have resonated with US President Donald Trump, who has called himself the “crypto president” and urged policymakers to revamp rules in favour of the industry.
“It’s riding a number of tailwinds at the moment,” said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, citing strong institutional demand, expectations of further gains and support from Trump as reasons for the bullishness.
“It’s been a very, very, strong move over the past six or seven days, and it’s hard to see where it stops now; it looks like it can easily have a look at the $125,000 level,” he said.
The surge in bitcoin, which is up 29pc for the year so far, has sparked a broader rally across other cryptocurrencies over the past few sessions, even in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs.
Ether, the second-largest token, scaled a more than five-month top of $3,050.90, while XRP and Solana gained about 3pc each.
The sector’s total market value has swelled to about $3.78 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Earlier this month, Washington declared the week of July 14 as “crypto week”, where members of Congress are set to vote on the Genius Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.
The most significant bill is the Genius Act, which would create federal rules for stablecoins.
Elsewhere, prices of crypto-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong similarly surged.
Spot bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera all scaled record highs, while the three ether ETFs managed by the asset managers were up roughly 2pc each.</p><small>2025-07-14 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141059065b833b7.jpg?r=105913' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924084/six-dead-27-injured-as-multan-bound-bus-crashes-on-motorway-near-chakri' target='_blank'><strong>Six dead, 27 injured as Multan-bound bus crashes on motorway near Chakri</strong></a><br><p>CHAKWAL: Six people, including four women, lost their lives while 27 others sustained injuries as a bus carrying them crashed on Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2) near Chakri Interchange on Sunday noon.

A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Fazal Subhan has accepted a petition filed by the firm, M/S Shamsi Builders Karachi, which has been in litigation with the authority since 2010, with multiple directives to the petitioner, Galiyat Development Authority (GDA) and KP Culture and Tourism Authority (KPCTA).
KPCTA, while terminating the lease agreement, had cited certain reasons stating that the firm had allegedly submitted faulty site plan not in consonance with GDA Building Bylaws and Act, which inflicted heavy losses on the exchequer.
The bench, in its 14-page detailed judgement, directed that the petitioner should be afforded a single opportunity for preparing and submitting a map of construction in accordance with the prevalent GDA regulations within 90 days.

The issue has been lingering on for the last 15 years

“Then an application shall be made along with proposed map to the director general of KP Culture and Tourism Authority. The department shall forward the map to GDA within 30 days of being submitted. GDA shall either approve the map within 30 days further or convey to the petitioner any reservation or objection which may be made on such building plan within same period of 30 days,” the bench ordered.
It directed that the petitioner should remove all such objections and submit a fresh building plan to GDA within 30 days thereafter in respect of which GDA should pass a written order within further 30 days either approving or disapproving the map by giving express reasons.
“If this time the map is disapproved by GDA finally or petitioner fails in removing valid objection conveyed to him in writing then KP Tourism Authority shall be at liberty to cancel the agreement again after affording opportunity of hearing to petitioner,” the bench ordered.
The bench observed that perusal of record revealed that passing termination order, petitioner had not been served with any notice nor afforded an opportunity of hearing. “He had been condemned unheard and therefore, the impugned order is not sustainable on this score,” it added.
The petitioner’s counsel Syed Tanveer Ashraf stated that in early 2007, the then Sarhad Tourism Corporation (STC) had invited bids for granting a 30-year lease of a four-kanal plot in main bazaar, Donga Gali, Abbottabad, to develop a tourism complex consisting of rooms, suites, restaurants and related facilities.
He said that the petitioner was declared successful bidder after which a lease agreement was executed with him on June 1, 2007. He added that in Dec 2007, the lease was amended to include an additional seven marlas increasing the lease land to four-kanal and seven marlas.
He stated that STC had earlier cancelled the lease through a letter on Feb 18, 2010, stating that no constriction had been initiated or completed within the two-year grace period, which ran from June 1, 2007 to June 1, 2009.
He said that the petitioner had challenged that order in PHC, which accepted his plea in May 2010, but GDA refused to approve the site/building plan. The counsel stated that it again served a notice on the petitioner in May 2011, warning it of termination of the lease in case the site plan was not approved within a month. He added that the petitioner again filed a petition in the high court, which clubbed it with 22 other petitions related to Galiyat areas.
In the meantime, he said, respondents including GDA produced a letter that the lease had been cancelled, following which the court disposed of that petition on June 15, 2023, observing that it had become infructuous.
He stated that the petitioner then field the present petition, challenging cancellation of the lease agreement by KPCTA.
The bench observed that the main reason for cancellation was that the petitioner had not been able to approve his building plan from GDA and couldn’t raise construction of the plot in accordance with the terms of his lease earlier granted to him.
Referring to the lease deed, the bench observed that the timeline would have started once the master plan had been approved by the lessor. It observed that it was an admitted fact that the petitioner had submitted construction plan eight times but the same had not been found favour with the relevant branch of GDA and every time it was objected by GDA.
The bench observed that since the master plan had not been approved so the time had not started running against the petitioner justifying termination of the lease deed.

The deputy commissioner is leading the ongoing operations.
During a visit to Thoya Fazil, the deputy commissioner inspected encroachments on the right of way along the irrigation department’s road and directed the departments concerned for their immediate removal.
The district administration also inspected illegal housing schemes built dangerously close to the River Indus, with the encroachments in direct violation of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa River Protection Act, 2014.
Water levels have already reached some residential structures in the affected areas, posing serious threats to life and property. In light of the imminent danger, the administration has issued 24-hour evacuation notices to residents and ordered the demolition of unsafe constructions.
So far, 18 houses have been vacated in a housing society, and one illegal swimming pool has been sealed.
Citizens have been advised to refrain from buying or selling plots or initiating construction activities in unauthorised housing societies located near or within river channels.
A spokesperson for the district administration said: “We are utilising all available resources to safeguard public life and property. Clearing encroachments, cleaning canals and drainage systems, and proactive flood management measures are our top priorities during the monsoon season.”

The rally, which had been scheduled about a week ago and jointly organised by local politicians, elders, traders, and peace activists, later turned into a massive gathering. It was held on the main Khar-Nawagai Road outside Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar.
The rally was held three days after the killing of Maulana Khan Zeb, a renowned peace campaigner and central leader of Awami National Party, who was killed along with a policeman during an attack on his vehicle by unidentified assailants near the rally venue on Thursday.
The participants of the rally were carrying white flags and white banners inscribed with various slogans in support of peace, such as ‘We want peace in our area’, ‘Peace is our life’, and ‘Peace is our right’. They also chanted slogans against lawlessness and violence in the district.

Speakers pay tributes to efforts of Maulana Khan Zeb for restoration of peace

Some participants also held photos of Maulana Khan Zeb, Rehan Zeb Khan and other prominent deceased politicians, social activists and tribal elders, who were killed in the district during the last few years.
Besides strict security arrangements by police, cold drinking water and cold drinks were also set up by locals and non-governmental welfare organisations for the participants of the rally, believed to be the largest such gathering in the district.
The special assistant to prime minister on tribal districts, MNA Mubarak Zeb Khan; MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman, Mohammad Nisar Khan and Anwar Zeb Khan; former lawmaker Guldad Khan; PML-N leader Shahabuddin Khan; PPP leader Sayed Akhunzada Chattan; JI local emir Sahibzada Haroon Rashid; JUI-F local chief Maulana Abdur Rasheed; Maulana Wahid Gul; Haji Sardar Khan; ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan; Khar tehsil council chairman Haji Said Badshah; PTI leaders Dr Khalilur Rehman and Najibullah Khan Mamund; ANP provincial council member and elder brother of Maulana Khan Zeb Sheikh Janzada; PML-N leader and chief convener of Bajaur Amaan Pasoon Malik Gul Kareem Khan addressed the rally.
They expressed concerns over lawlessness and targeted killing incidents in the district, describing the current law and order situation as the ‘worst’ since the 2008 military operation. They said that the district had witnessed a number of military operations in different names since 2008.
They said that poor law and order not only made life insecure for residents of the district but also disrupted their daily routine.
“The present poor law and order situation and increasing targeted killings are not only creating an environment of fear and insecurity among people but also impacting trade, business and other activities,” they added.
They complained that people of all walks of life of the district had been crying for solid efforts to end lawlessness in the region, but both federal and provincial governments and relevant authorities failed to fulfil their responsibilities of ensuring a peaceful environment for them like rest of the country.
Speakers said that a number of people had been killed in different violence-related incidents over the past several years. However, they alleged that authorities concerned had yet to arrest any culprit. They said that people of Bajaur, once known for peace and beauty before 9/11, were tired of burying their loved ones and wanted an end to lawlessness and targeted killings.
Calling the rally the beginning of their efforts for peace in the district, they said that such peaceful gatherings would continue to pressure government to restore peace in the region. They urged provincial and federal governments to take serious and result-oriented steps to restore peace in the district.
They said people of Bajaur would stage a massive protest demonstration in Islamabad if they didn’t see concrete efforts to end lawlessness in the region. The participants of the rally also condemned the killing of Maulana Khan Zeb and termed his murder a great loss to Bajaur, especially peace narrative.
Calling him the champion and ambassador of peace, they said that his efforts for peace would always be remembered. They said that the rally showed that people from all walks of life were on the same page for restoration peace in the district.
All bazaars, trade and business centres remained closed across the district. Public transport vehicles also remained suspended on Sunday.

The case was registered on complaint of Motra Police Station SHO Mobin Ahmed Cheema who said that the police were performing routine duty when they reached village Ralioke at 2pm and found a mob carrying hammers, sticks and iron rods.
The mob wanted to demolish the Jamaat-e-Ahmadiyya’s Baitul Zikr. He said that the angry protesters were told several times not to take the law into their hands but in vain. Instead, they attacked the policemen.
The officer said that a heavy contingent reached the spot on receiving information about the attack on the police.
When the SP investigation Sialkot reached the spot, the angry protesters attacked the police once again, pelted them with stones and opened fire, damaging the van of the SP and the prisoners.
 
 

The protesters damaged police vehicles and injured police personnel, including Ehtesham Ali, Muhammad Owais and Tariq Mahmood. The injured personnel were shifted to hospital for treatment.
According to the SHO, the police seized three pistols and bullets from the spot. Motra Police Station registered an FIR against 42 identified and 100 unidentified suspects under sections 324/353/440/148/149/295 /295A/153A of the PPC and 7-ATA. Some of the suspects were arrested on the day of the incident while others were arrested on Sunday.
 
 

Videos of the attack on Ahmadi place were circulated on social media on Friday. Before that, suspects had made announcements on social media, urging the people to gather at village Ralioke.

Alcaraz’s bid for a third straight title at the All England Club ended with a 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4 loss on Centre Court, leaving him to digest his first Grand Slam final defeat.
“It’s always a bad feeling losing matches. It’s a little bit worse when you lose in a final,” said Alcaraz, who narrowly beat Sinner in a five-set humdinger at the French Open last month.
“I’m just proud about everything I’ve done in the last four weeks on grass at London. I leave Wimbledon, the court, with my head held really high because I did everything that I could.
“I played against someone who played an unbelievable game. So I’m just a little bit sad about losing, but with my head held really high.”
Alcaraz said his rivalry with Sinner was great for the pair and also for tennis, which has had to endure the retirements of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray in recent years with fellow great Novak Djokovic in the twilight of a glorious career.
The young duo have now shared eight of the last nine Grand Slam titles, with each winning four.
“Every time we play each other, I think our level is really high. We don’t see a level like this. I don’t see any player playing against each other, having the level that we’re playing when we face each other,” Alcaraz added.
Extra Attention
“This rivalry, it’s becoming better and better. We’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, finals of Masters and the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better.
“I’m just really grateful for that because it gives me the opportunity to just give my 100 per cent every practice, every day, just to be better. The level that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Jannik is really high.”
Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill admitted that while the Italian did not take any of his rivals for granted, he does pay extra attention to Alcaraz.
“Jannik watches more Carlos matches than he does anybody else because he’s fascinated with the improvements that are coming in his game, and he’s pushing us as coaches to make sure that he’s improving as a tennis player,” Cahill said.
Sinner, who ended Alcaraz’s 24-match winning run across all events and 20-match streak at Wimbledon, was most pleased with ending his own run of five successive defeats against the Spaniard.
“When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy,” said Sinner, who narrowed his win-loss record against Alcaraz to 5-8.
“At the same time in the past, I felt I was close. I never pushed myself down. I keep looking up to Carlos because even today I felt like he was doing a couple of things better than I did. So that’s something we’ll work on and prepare ourselves because he’s going to come for us again.
“There’s not only Carlos, but everyone. We have a big target on us so we have to be prepared. Then we’ll see what’s happening in the future.”
Alcaraz said he had no doubt that Sinner would learn from his near 5-1/2-hour loss at Roland Garros, where the Italian squandered three championship points, and hit back.
“I know he’s a really nice player and a huge champion. Champions learn from their losses,” Alcaraz said.
“I knew from the beginning he was going to learn from that final and not make the same mistakes. The way he played today, it was really high.
“I wasn’t surprised at all.”</p><small>2025-07-14 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/140946297216dc0.png?r=094649' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924014/top-leadership-backs-kashmir-cause-with-fresh-resolve-on-martyrs-day' target='_blank'><strong>Top leadership backs Kashmir cause with fresh resolve on Martyrs’ Day</strong></a><br><p>• Calls on international community to address India’s ‘state terrorism,’ ‘extrajudicial killings,’ and human rights violations
• Parallel drawn between Dogra regime and Modi govt actions
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s top leadership on Sunday reaffirmed the country’s unwavering support for the Kashmiri’s people right to self-determination and their resistance against oppression, marking Kashmir Martyrs’ Day with renewed pledges of political, diplomatic and moral backing.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, paid tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of Kashmiris in their decades long struggle against Indian rule.
Both leaders vowed that Pakistan will continue to support Kashmir cause until the region achieve self-governance in accordance with UN resolutions.
President Zardari commended Kashmiris for their “steadfast bravery and sacrifices” against Indian control and called upon international bodies and human rights groups to address the alleged state terrorism and rights violations in the occupied region.
PM Shehbaz echoed these sentiment, emphasising the “ongoing sacrifices made by Kashmiris in their fight for self-determination”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to supporting their cause “politically, ethically, and diplomatically”.
Naqvi condemns ‘oppression’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the 22 Kashmiri martyrs of July 13, 1931, who, he said, “faced bullets with courage and dignity in reverence of the call to prayer (Azaan).”
He described the day as “harbringer of free conscience against a system that sought to silence the oppressed”, drawing parallel between the Dogra regime and the current violence of Modi’s government.
He accused the Modi government of “oppressive actions against Kashmiris,” including “the genocide of Kashmiri youth, extrajudicial killings, and silencing of journalists”.
Naqvi also referenced former US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate on Kashmir, saying, “US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate opened a door to peace, but India closed this door, proving its warlike mindset through its rejection of dialogue.”
AJK PM’s warning
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq, in an interview with a local news channel, said the sacrifice of the martyrs “formed the bedrock of the Kashmiri freedom movement, a fight that will endure.”
He urged the international community to recognise the Kashmiris’ “legitimate right to self-determination” and called for renewed efforts to resolve the conflict through peaceful dialogue.
Anwar-ul-Haq warned that “India’s brutality shows no signs of abating,” and cautioned that continued aggression would “only harden the resolve of Kashmiris, escalate their struggle for freedom, and provoke a fierce and uncompromising response from Pakistan’s armed forces”.
He also accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan, calling for international accountability.

Mr Urubko, with his wife Maria Cardell, arrived at base camp on Saturday and scaled the killer mountain without using supplementary oxygen.
Karim Shah Nizari, a friend of the climbers, told Dawn that the duo successfully opened a new route via Diamir Face on Nanga Parbat. According to the Russian media, they scaled the mountain fast and light and returned safely to the base camp after the summit.
With this achievement, Mr Uru­bko has made 28 ascents of the eight-thousanders, with seven new routes opened and two first winter ascents, including Makalu in 2009 and Gash­erbrum II in 2011. He has also scaled all 14 highest mountains in the world without using supplementary oxygen.
Nanga Parbat is more southern and western than Pakistan’s four other eight-thousanders peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I, and Gasherbrum II. Nanga Parbat, also known as the killer mountain, is situated in the Himalayas. During the ongoing season, at least 24 climbers, including five Pakistani nationals, have summited the peak.
Injured Polish climber
Meanwhile, a rescue team brought  to Camp 1 an injured Polish climber who sustained a leg injury on Broad Peak on Sunday.
Waldemar Kowalewski suffered a fracture above Camp II on Saturday when a snow avalanche hit the trio during their rotation.As a result of the incident, Mr Kowalewski suffered a leg fracture at an altitude of 6,500 metres, while his two colleagues Jarek and Hassan surviving without any injuries. After the accident, a rescue team was dispatched to bring the Polish climber down to the base camp.
According to Karrar Haidri, the vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the injured mountaineer had been brought down to Camp 1 on Sunday and the rescuers were assessing the safest option for further descent. According to organisers, Pakistan Army helicopters will airlift the Polish climber from the Broad Peak base camp to Skardu today (Monday).

• No international party participated in bidding
ISLAMABAD: The government’s ambitious plan to auction old and defunct public sector generation plants under Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL) — aimed at curtailing operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure — is in serious trouble, compelling authorities to consider handing over the scrap to Wah Industries of the Ministry of Defence.
Sources said the first round of auction, which appeared to be a success on the sale counter, could not generate any proceeds so far in almost four months amid management’s inability to secure binding contracts while the second round failed to take off even on the scheduled bidding date.
“Frustrated by repeated failures and lack of credible bids in subsequent auctions, the Energy Task Force led by Lt Gen Zafar Iqbal decided earlier this month to make a major policy shift and hand over all remaining power plants to Wah Industries through a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement by the end of the current month”, said the sources.
Last year, the government had decided to close down old, redundant and defunct public-sector Genco plants and auction their obsolete machinery and equipment (excluding land) via an open international bidding process.
The Task Force on Energy Reforms that was holding separate negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) gave the GHCL management three-month target for the auction and close of transaction. On March 18, the first phase of nine old power plants was put up for auction through open bidding. Only seven plants received qualified bids amounting Rs9.05bn against a reserve price of Rs8.07bn.
However, no international bidder participated in the bidding process. As per the contract requirements, the bid money was must to be paid either 100pc in advance or through four installments within three months.
Among the seven awarded plants, six contracts were bagged by M/S Daraza Builders while the contract for the 20MW Multan Cantt plant was awarded to M/S Malik Bashir Traders.
At the 147MW Kotri Power Plant, Genco-I or JPCL signed a contract worth Rs1.88bn with M/S Daraza, which deposited the required 10pc performance guarantee but no further payment has been received to date. Surprisingly, Genco-1 top management did not issue any delay notices or invoke interest penalties — despite clear contractual clauses.
Genco-II (CPGCL) returned a bid security of over Rs96m to M/S Daraza for the 50MW Sukkur Plant without contract finalisation.
At the 57.2 MW Quetta Power Plant, a second-phase bid of Rs601m was submitted by Perfect Tel Company. Payment delays continue, allegedly with the tacit support of Genco-II (CPGCL) and GHCL top brass.
Procedural lapses have also been reported in Genco-III (NPGCL) whose management is internally under scrutiny for delaying contracts of key plants. For example, contract for TPS Multan Cantt plant (20MW) was signed in June 2025 with M/S Malik Bashir Traders — three months after the auction, raising concerns over NPGCL’s intent.
Contracts for NGPS Multan (260MW) and GTPS Shahdara (85MW), both awarded to M/S Daraza, are only now being signed — with delays of over 3.5 months. Contract for GTPS Faisalabad (247 MW) remains unsigned amid speculations of interest-based gains.
Meanwhile, LPGCL (Genco-IV) signed a Rs2.133bn contract with M/S Daraza for the Lakhra Power Plant in May 2025. Although the first installment was paid, the second was delayed by 18 days.

• Absence of quorum potentially leaves water body’s decisions open to audit objections, legal challenges
LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), one of the country’s largest state-owned entities with a portfolio of almost $70 billion, has found itself mired in red tape in the absence of key decision-making officials.
The failure to fill two vacant slots on its governing body despite the passage of nine months, has hampered its operations.
This bureaucratic paralysis is particularly worrisome, given that Wapda is currently tasked with executing three of the biggest hydroelectric projects in the country’s history — the dams at Diamer-Bhasha, Dasu and Mohmand.
In addition, the authority effectively serves as the operative wing of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), which distributes water among federating units and ensure national irrigation supplies.
Ironically, Irsa too is embroiled in litigation over the composition of its board, with the appointment of a permanent member from Sindh being the focus of the dispute.
The Wapda Act envisions a governing body, comprising three permanent members — for water, power and finance — and a regular chairman heading the authority, which looks after hundreds of billions of rupees allocations every year.
Currently, the body is without permanent members for water and power, and their functions are being “looked after” by two senior officials — Syed Ali Akhtar Shah and Muhammad Arfan, respectively.
The former previously served as General Manager Water (South), while the latter is also the CEO of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Company.
‘Look after’ charge
By its very definition, ‘look after’ charge implies that the current holder of the post cannot take “financial and administrative decisions” of any consequence — much like a caretaker government.
In June, when former chairman retired Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani stepped down, the sole permanent member, Naveed Asghar Chaudhry, was given additional charge of that role too. Mr Chaudhry’s original designation is member for finance, and he is a permanent appointee on that post.
This means that, effectively, the four-member board is currently operating with one permanent officer and two who have been given ‘additional charge’.
Mr Chaudhry also served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022, after retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to Lt-Gen Ghani three months later.
According to a former director general of human resources at Wapda, “This is administrative chaos with a huge national cost”. For instance, the authority at present cannot meet even its quorum requirements – a legal necessity for taking any decision.
For quorum to be complete, the chairman and at least one regular member are required to be present, but these posts are currently held by the same person.
In such a situation, any decision taken by the board can potentially attract audit objections or legal challenges.
Blame game
Dawn made several attempts to contact Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, the incumbent federal minister for water resources, over the course of two weeks.
However, both the minister and his spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the composition of Wapda’s governing body.
But insiders told Dawn that the tenure of the two members for water and power expired in November last year.
Sources claimed the ministry was also informed of this in advance, and an advertisement to fill both posts was sent to the ministry for approval in October 2024. However, the ministry has not advertised the posts, nor allowed Wapda to do so, they said.
The outgoing members, meanwhile, were reportedly instructed to remain in their posts. This arrangement continued till March 13, 2025, when they eventually relinquished their posts on verbal instructions from on-high, after the ministry inquired about the expiry of their tenures. After that, the authority gave ‘look after’ charge of the two vacant posts to two senior officers.
Wapda sources claimed they kept pressing the ministry for the appointments, but to no avail. It was in the midst of this confusion that the previous chairman abruptly quit on June 20.
Following his exit, the ministry handed his responsibilities to the only surviving permanent member (finance) of the authority.
The ministry, however, shifted the blame for blocked appointments onto the PM’s Office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the water resources ministry told Dawn that selection boards were named to hire these officers and sent the PMO, but there had been no response.
The ministry was subsequently told that the names of the selection board members had been sent for “vetting” and the process is still ongoing.

• Boat ‘Handala’ with 15 activists on board carrying medical and food  supplies
• No breakthrough in talks for temporary ceasefire
SICILY/GAZA: A Gaza-bound boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid left Sicily on Sunday, over a month after Israel detained and deported people aboard a previous vessel, as Israel struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours, killing more than 40 Palestinians, most of them civilians, amid a deadlock in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.
The Handala boat, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, left the port of Syracuse shortly after 12pm carrying about 15 activists.
Several dozen people, some holding Palestinian flags and others wearing keffiyeh scarves, gathered at the port to cheer the boat’s departure with slogans of “Free Palestine”.
 






The former Norwegian trawler — loaded with medical supplies, food, children’s equipment and medicine — will sail for about a week in the Mediterranean, covering roughly 1,800 kilometres (1,120 miles), in the hope of reaching Gaza’s coast.
The boat will make a stop at Gallipoli, in southeastern Italy, where two members of the hard-left France Unbowed party (LFI) are expected to join.
The initiative comes six weeks after the departure of the Madleen, another ship that left Italy for Gaza transporting aid and activists, including Greta Thunberg.
Israel authorities intercepted the Madleen about 185 kilometres west of Gaza’s coast.
“This is a mission for the children in Gaza, to break the humanitarian blockade and to break the summer silence on the genocide,” said Gabrielle Cathala, one of the two France Unbowed party members set to board the boat on July 18.
“I hope we will reach Gaza but if not, it will be yet another violation of international law” by Israel, she added.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Sunday killed more than 40 Palestinians, most of them women and children, including at a market and a water distribution point, as talks for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stalled.
Delegations from Israel and the Palestinian group have now spent a week trying to agree on a temporary truce to halt 21 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip.
But on Saturday, each side accused the other of blocking attempts to secure an agreement at the indirect talks in the Qatari capital, Doha.
On the ground, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said at least 43 people were killed in the latest Israeli strikes, including 11 when a market in Gaza City was hit.
Elsewhere, eight children were among the 10 victims of a drone
strike at a water point in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, Bassal said.
Khaled Rayyan told journalists he was woken by the sound of two large explosions after a house was hit in Nuseirat.
“Our neighbour and his children were under the rubble,” he said.
150 targets in a day
The Israeli military said in a statement its air force struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours. It released aerial footage of what it said were fighter jet strikes attacking what it claimed Hamas targets around Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, showing explosions on the ground and thick smoke in the sky.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing many areas mean journalists are unable to independently verify tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency and other parties.
Talks to seal a 60-day ceasefire and Israeli prisoner release were in the balance on Saturday, as Israel and Hamas accused each other of trying to block a deal.
Hamas wants complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, but Israel had presented plans to maintain troops in more than 40 per cent of the territory.
A Palestinian source said Israel wanted to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into the south of Gaza in preparation for forcibly displacing them to Egypt or other countries.
Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 57,882 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Israel attacks. The UN considers the figures reliable.

• KP CM claims party will decide after three months ‘whether to continue with politics’
• Days after founder eschewed talks, Gandapur claims Imran ready to sit with powers that be
LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by PTI founder Imran Khan, which is expected to climax on Aug 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’.
Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of  Imran Khan and his spouse, CM Gandapur said that the 90-day countdown had already begun.
However, the mixed messages left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether.
At the press conference, the KP CM appeared to surprise even his party colleagues when he said, “The protest campaign had started last night and would reach its crescendo in 90 days for a final showdown”.
The KP CM did not mention any date, but when quizzed by reporters, he reiterated the party’s position that the protest campaign would be taken to its peak by Aug 5 using political means.
“We have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country… if [political means] do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward,” he said, adding that he had given himself three months to prepare for the protest.
“We will either do or die,” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”.
Dissent from Aliya
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik was conspicuous by her absence from the presser. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, Ms Malik questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Mr Raja.
Some PTI workers also said that it appeared as if the party had let them off the hook for the Aug 5 protest. Some voices also questioned why the party leadership had yet to announce a proper plan for the movement, given that Aug 5 was just a few weeks away, and wondered whether this meant the protest plan had been postponed.
‘Door open for talks’
Even though the idea of dialogue was shunned in a tweet from Imran Khan’s official X account last week, the KP chief minister, apparently on behalf of the former premier, once again offered the military establishment to engage in dialogue with the party.
“Now we are giving an open offer (to the establishment) to hold dialogue with us or we will get to ‘tread on our own path’ with clear timeline and targets”.
He also criticised the powers that be for indulging in politics. Reiterating that the establishment had hijacked the system, the KP CM said the PTI would hold dialogue with the powers that be and went on to add that “they can let the (puppet) politicians sit beside them”.
“We no longer want to waste time talking to the ruling politicians, who carry no power to make a decision,” he added.
While the PTI has consistently been demanding talks with the establishment, these overtures have not received a positive response from the concerned quarters thus far.
The KP CM also blamed state institutions for a spike in terrorism in Balochistan and KP.
“When it is asked about making and breaking governments, it simply says the institution is apolitical,” he quipped, while asking the establishment to accept its mistakes and rectify them. He said the army was earning a ‘bad reputation’, and asked where it wanted to take the country.

Amid reports of a possible change of PTI-led government in KP, a PML-N source told Dawn that Mr Kundi has planned a meeting of opposition leaders at Governor House soon.
The Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) has opposed any change of provincial government through a presidential order, Governor’s Rule, but did not rule out a constitutional and parliamentary way like a ‘no-confidence motion’, JUI-F leader Maulana Ghafoor Haideri said on Sunday.
The source said Gover­nor Kundi and Amir Muqam discussed the possible change in KP as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a committee to seek the support of oppo­sition leaders in the province to achieve the goal.
 
 

Meanwhile, Mr Kundi visited the residence of former PTI leader and incumbent adviser to the PM Pervez Khattak to condole the death of his sister.
A few days ago, the governor also met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Mr Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently, followed by the issuance of a press release stating that the PM tasked Mr Kundi with starting a campaign to form a new government in KP and hold consultations with opposition members of the provincial assembly. Both Mr Kundi and Mr Muqam had been tasked with meeting JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultations.
Last week, Opposition Leader in the Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Assembly Dr Ibadullah visited Governor Kundi. The meeting, which was also attended by PPP’s KP chapter president Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha, discussed overall political situation in the province.
Media reports said that Dr Ibad had briefed the governor on the ongoing coordination and mutual engagement among members of the opposition parties.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the recent outreach by independent members of the provincial assembly and discussed the upcoming Senate elections.

The two sides met for more than two hours on the weekend. The meeting, chaired by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan,  was also attended by Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
The meeting was a follow-up to Friday’s huddle, where both sides agreed to resolve issues through talks after days of acrimony and recriminations.
The PTI lawmakers were suspended for 15 sittings after their protest during the speech of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on June 27.
In addition, 10 members of the provincial assembly were fined Rs200,000 each for “damaging public property”, while disqualification references were also filed against them.
A number of treasury members had also moved for their opposition colleagues’ disqualification. It was these applications which were the subject of Sunday’s discussions.
‘Not a deadlock’
Speaking to the media after Sunday’s meeting, Mr Bhachar acknowledged the talks had not been fruitful so far.
He clarified that neither side had apologised for any verbal altercations, noting that “insults came from both sides.”
He emphasised that more meetings will take place and “no agreement has been reached on any point,” particularly concerning the Rules of Procedure of the House.
“A deadlock means walking away. Until there is no agreement, discussions will continue,” he stated.
He confirmed that discussions on the fines and suspension of the 26 members would also continue.
The PTI leader also talked about the persisting concerns of his party, including legal cases against opposition members and the imprisonment of Imran Khan, which “will not end immediately”.
He said PTI will move forward after consulting with the parliamentary party.
The meeting came a day after PTI’s top leadership, including Khyber Pakh–tunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, arrived in Lahore to support the penalised lawmakers.
Mutual respect
PML-N leader Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman said the two-and-a-half-hour-long talks had been “good”, but nothing was finalised yet.
Mr Rehman, who’s also Punjab’s finance minister, emphasised the importance of upholding the assembly’s dignity.
“There is much to discuss with the opposition,” Mr Rehman said, adding the people of Punjab were watching these negotiations.
He acknowledged public pressure from constituencies to end “hooliganism, verbal abuse,  and violent culture” within the assembly.
He indicated that PTI would consult with its parliamentary party, and the government would also hold consultations before the two sides reconvene for future talks.
“Our goal is not to de-seat anyone,” he said, adding negotiations among elected representatives “should lead to a point of agreement”.
He revealed that four or five agenda points were discussed and agreed upon during Sunday’s meeting.
Regarding the reference against the suspended members, Mr Rehman said the speaker had sent the reference as per articles 62 and 63.
He compared the speaker’s move to the reference against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif under Articles 62 and 63, which led to the loss of his premiership.
He also mentioned a harassment complaint received by the speaker, clarifying the current discussions were about assembly rules and not a compromise.
He hoped the situation inside the assembly matters would soon improve.
“The assembly rules and law stipulate how punishment and reward are meted out,” he said, adding both opposition and government should play a role in running the House smoothly.
Bilal Yasin, another PML-N lawmaker, also addressed the media.
He said PML-N leaders have trained party workers to engage in political dialogue with politicians.
Mr Yasin said CM Maryam also wants things to “move forward”.
However, he added that being CM Maryam, should be treated with respect whenever she entered the assembly.
Similar respect was also “obligatory” for the opposition leader.
He said protest was a democratic right, but agitations should be “within some limits”.

These commissions — focusing on constitutional, electoral, judicial, administrative, and anti-corruption reforms — have submitted their reports. Now, the task of building political consensus on their recommendations rests with the seven-member National Consensus Commission, which began its work on Feb 15 under the leadership of the chief adviser. The commission’s mandate is to facilitate dialogue and agreement among political parties on proposals that could fundamentally reshape the nation’s governance framework.
One of the more contentious issues to have surfaced in recent discussions is whether Bangladesh should adopt a proportional representation (PR) system for future parliamentary elections. Political parties are divided. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has publicly supported the idea and submitted proposals to that effect. Other parties have expressed similar interest, viewing PR as a route to more inclusive governance. But the BNP has strongly opposed it. 
Interestingly, despite the divide over PR, there is reported convergence on other structural reforms, such as the establishment of a bicameral legislature with a 100-member upper house and the assignment of the deputy speaker’s role to the opposition.
To assess the feasibility of PR, one must return to the constitution. Article 65(2) provides that members of parliament shall be elected from single-member territorial constituencies by direct election. This enshrines the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model as the basis of Bangladesh’s electoral process. Any move to introduce PR for the lower house would require a constitutional amendment under Article 142, which demands a two-thirds majority vote in parliament — a hurdle that is currently insurmountable in the absence of an elected legislature.

PR systems allow for greater representation of women, religious minorities and other under-represented groups

Furthermore, the reform commissions themselves have not advocated for PR in the lower house, provided that the bicameral parliamentary model is implemented. The Constitution Reform Commission has proposed retaining the direct election model for the lower house while suggesting that the proposed upper house could be constituted through a proportional representation system (pages 51-52 of its report).
Meanwhile, the Electoral Reform Commission, despite extensive consultations, refrained from making any recommendation on this issue, citing sharp political disagreement (pages 84-87 of its report). The Electoral Reform Commission recognised that any change in the method of election would require a consensus that simply does not exist at this stage.
The absence of any recommendation in favour of PR for the lower house has legal and procedural consequences. The mandate of the National Consensus Commission is confined to building agreement on the proposals previously submitted by the major reform commissions, as it was established specifically to foster consensus around those earlier reform recommendations. Since the relevant commissions have not proposed PR for the lower house, this issue technically falls outside the scope of the current dialogue. More importantly, the Constitution Reform Commission has in fact proposed preserving the existing direct electoral system for the Jatiya Sangsad. It would therefore be institutionally inconsistent and procedurally misplaced for the National Consensus Commission to entertain a proposal that contradicts the reform roadmap already submitted.
This, however, does not mean that the conversation about PR is unwarranted. As a theoretical model, PR has several merits. It promises to reduce the distortions produced by FPTP, under which a party can win an overwhelming majority of seats with a far smaller share of the popular vote. It offers a more inclusive framework, potentially giving smaller and emerging parties a fair chance at representation. It can encourage coalition politics, reduce political alienation, and better reflect the diversity of public opinion. In principle, PR systems also allow for greater representation of women, religious minorities, and other underrepresented groups. Unlike the existing system, which reserves seats for women through indirect party nominations, a well-designed PR system could enable women to be elected directly from party lists. 
Many countries that have adopted PR, such as Sweden, Nepal and South Africa, have seen marked improvements in the descriptive and substantive representation of marginalised groups. Yet any electoral system must be judged not in isolation but within the context in which it is to operate. Bangladesh’s political culture is highly polarised. Its democratic institutions remain fragile. Electoral processes have been repeatedly marred by violence, boycotts, and allegations of irregularities. In this context, PR might introduce new complexities rather than resolve existing ones. Far from encouraging stable coalition governments, it could lead to fragmented parliaments filled with single-issue or regionally entrenched parties, making coherent governance difficult.
Another concern is institutional capacity. Implementing PR would require significant administrative reform, voter education, and legislative clarity. Public understanding of how votes translate into seats would need to be built through large-scale civic education programmes. Without careful preparation, the transition could create confusion and mistrust, further damaging an already strained electoral system.
Even among civil society, support for a blanket introduction of PR in the lower house is limited. Recently, 60 eminent citizens publicly called for a PR-based upper house to enhance inclusion and accountability. However, they were cautious about replicating that model for the lower house, fearing legislative gridlock and excessive fragmentation. Their view aligns with the Constitution Reform Commission’s recommendation: preserve direct elections in the lower house but use PR for the proposed upper chamber to ensure a balance between local representation and proportional fairness.
That, perhaps, offers a way forward. Bangladesh could consider a mixed electoral system in the future, combining FPTP and PR models. Such systems are used successfully in countries like Germany and New Zealand, where some parliamentary seats are filled by direct constituency vote and others by party list based on national vote share. Alternatively, Bangladesh could introduce PR incrementally, first at the local government level or in a newly created upper house, allowing for institutional adaptation and political learning.
For now, however, the road to a PR system in parliamentary elections remains closed— legally, politically, and procedurally. The current constitution does not allow it. The reform commissions have not endorsed it. The political consensus required to amend the constitution is absent. And the mandate of the National Consensus Commission technically does not extend to issues beyond the submitted reform proposals.

The intelligence agency said in a statement that the operation had sought the arrest of the agents of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), who it believes were behind the killing of SBU colonel Ivan Voronych in Kyiv on Thursday.
“This morning a special operation was conducted, during which the members of the Russian FSB’s agent cell started to resist, and therefore they were liquidated,” the statement on the Telegram messaging app said.
Russian authorities made no immediate public comment on Sunday’s operation, which mirrored past assassinations of senior Russian military officials by Ukraine during the three-year-old war — a source of embarrassment for Moscow’s vast intelligence agencies. The SBU said two people — a man and a woman — were suspected of having killed Voronych. It did not say how many suspected FSB agents had been killed on Sunday.
According to the SBU, the alleged assassins were told by their handler to surveil their target and track his movements. They were eventually given the coordinates of a hiding place where they found a pistol with a suppressor, the SBU said.
It said they had tried to  “lay low” after Thursday’s killing, but were tracked down by the SBU and police.
The agency’s remit covers security and counterintelligence, but since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine it has also played a prominent role in special operations against Moscow, including assassinations and sabotage attacks.

Of 24 sewage samples tested, 13 were negative while 11 were positive for poliovirus, an official of the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the NIH said. 
The progress, especially in high-risk areas, was hailed as a sign of successful eradication efforts. 
“Environmental Surveillance (ES) results continue to reflect encouraging progress, particularly in high-risk regions.” the official said. 
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), positivity rates have declined from 14 positive ES sites in January to seven in June 2025. 
Of these seven positive sites in June, four are from south KP. Notably, all six sites in Peshawar tested negative for the first time in over two years.” 
Similar progress was reported across other provinces. 
“Balochistan also reported a marked reduction, with only four positive ES sites in June, down from 19 in January. In the Quetta Block, six out of seven samples tested negative,” the official said. 
“In Punjab, the number of districts with positive detections decreased from seven in January to five in June. In Sindh, the number of positive ES sites has also declined compared to previous months.” 
Officials attributed the declining numbers to intensified surveillance and immunisation campaigns. 
“Thanks to high-quality campaigns with rigorous vaccination schedule, polio cases and positive environmental samples nationwide have declined,” the official said. 
To build on this momentum, several targeted immunisation drives are scheduled. 
A special campaign will run from July 14 to 18 in Diamer and three districts of KP, targeting 158,497 children. A similar drive in Rawalpindi and Islamabad next week aims to immunise 161,422 children. 
A cross-border effort with Afghanistan will take place from July 21 to 25, targeting 378,122 children in bordering union councils to synchronise with Afghanis­tan’s sub-national polio campaign. 
Also, a campaign using a combination of fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine and oral poliovirus vaccine will be conducted in seven districts of Baloc­histan from Aug 4 to 11, aiming to vaccinate approximately 600,000 children.
