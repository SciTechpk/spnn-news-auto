A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan and a laboured chase later saw the hosts beat Sri Lanka by six wickets to complete a 3-0 series sweep over the visitors in the third and final ODI at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Babar was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for a Level 1 ICC Code of Conduct breach, which carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50pc of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.

“The 31-year-old has been found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to ‘abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match’,” ICC said in a press release.
One demerit point has been added to his disciplinary record, making it his first  in a 24-month period.
The incident occurred in the 21st over of Pakistan’s innings when Babar hit the stumps with his bat before leaving the crease following his dismissal (34 off 52) by Sri Lanka’s Jeffery Vandersay.
According to ICC,on-field umpires Alex Wharf and Rashid Riaz, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid and fourth umpire Faisal Afridi levelled the charge while Ali Naqvi of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees proposed the sanction.
The Pakistan batter admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction, negating the need for a formal hearing.</p><small>2025-11-18 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18152656b26028d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955834/opposition-alliance-ttap-stages-march-from-parliament-house-to-supreme-court-against-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance TTAP stages march from Parliament House to Supreme Court against 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Tuesday staged a march from Parliament House to Supreme Court as part of its nationwide protest movement against the newly enacted 27th Amendment.
The 27th Amendment was signed into law on November 13 after passage from the parliament amid strong criticism by the opposition parties. The legislation, which has brought major structural changes to the judiciary and the military, has been assailed by the legal fraternity, even former and sitting judges, as an “attack” on judicial independence.
In a meeting on Friday, the TTAP had vowed to vigorously protest to “restore the Constitution to its original form”.
Under a plan announced then, members of parties under the TTAP umbrella gathered outside Parliament House today to hold a protest. They then marched to the Supreme Court on Constitution Avenue.
TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI Senator Faisal Javed were at the forefront of the march, visuals shared by the TTAP on social media platform X showed.
“Battle will persist till the judiciary’s independence,” they chanted. TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai could be seen participating in the march as well.
 






At the protest outside Parliament House, visuals shared by the TTAP showed protesters holding banners that read “Death to dictatorship, long live democracy”, “27th Amendment rejected”, and “Subjugation of the judiciary is the public’s subjugation”.
Achakzai, Abbas, Raja, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser were among the key leaders present at the protest. Others included PTI MNAs Zain Qureshi and Junaid Akbar, Balochistan National Party-Mengal’s (BNP-M) Sajid Tareen, Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai and PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry.
 






The gathered protesters chanted, “Aise dastoor ko nahi maantey, subh-i-be-nur ko nahi maantey” (we do not accept this constitution, we do not accept this morning bereft of light) — echoing Habib Jalib’s poetry, also used by opposition lawmakers in recent parliamentary sessions.
The TTAP leaders also raised slogans in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan, with some holding party flags.
 






National moot planned; ‘Black Day’ on Friday
Addressing the media, Achakzai announced that TTAP will organise a national conference on the 27th Amendment, where judges, lawyers, journalists, experts, and others will be invited.
The TTAP chief, as decided in the group’s Friday meeting, also announced that a “Black Day” will be observed on Friday (November 21) across the country in protest of the 27th Amendment.
He reiterated the TTAP’s objection to the lifetime immunities granted to the army chief and the president through the 27th Amendment, stressing that every person shall be held accountable for their actions under Islam.
Achakzai further said that even if a political party held a “100 per cent mandate” in the parliament, it could not change the “basic structure” of the Constitution of civilian supremacy. “The military, the judiciary, everyone will be independent in their functions, but they must be subservient to the elected parliament,” he asserted.
 






Speaking to reporters, Qaiser said the TTAP leadership, civil society, lawyers, mediapersons and other stakeholders will gather next week to formulate the future action plan.
In a post on X, Qaiser said protesters criticised the government for “disfiguring the unanimous Constitution of 1973 through force and horse-trading”. “We do not accept any 26th or 27th Amendment passed through the back as they fundamentally aim to bring the judiciary under the executive,” he added.
 






At the protest, Raja stressed that PTI lawmakers were the “representatives of the Pakistani public” and they rejected the new amendments, saying they were an “attack on the judiciary and the people”. “Your [and] my life, property, chaddor (honour), privacy — all has been taken away,” he claimed.
Yesterday, PTI MPAs held a walk from the Punjab Assembly to Charing Cross on The Mall to record their protest against the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Last week, the TTAP also said a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th Amendment.
The TTAP, formed in April last year, is a coalition of six opposition parties, including the PTI. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.</p><small>2025-11-18 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18152702d802da7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955843/sco-well-placed-to-promote-regional-cooperation-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>SCO ‘well-placed’ to promote regional cooperation: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, on Tuesday, while addressing a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conference in Moscow, said the summit was “well-placed” to promote regional cooperation in dealing with emergencies and to extend cooperation in the humanitarian field.
The SCO is holding its Council of Heads of Government summit in Moscow from November 17 to 18. Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin Summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order.
“Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.”
 






He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal, “a signal that our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”.
The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space.
“Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region.
“Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said.
He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals.
This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”.
“An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.”
“Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said.
Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy and build human capital.
“While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said.
With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”.
“The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed.
“We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” he said, adding that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect.
“Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.”
A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to the Russian capital.
 






The SCO summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this year, was held from August 31 to September 1. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date.</p><small>2025-11-18 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18143738303f343.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955826/ppps-faisal-rathore-sworn-in-as-new-ajk-prime-minister' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Faisal Rathore sworn in as new AJK prime minister</strong></a><br><p>Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore on Tuesday was sworn in as the 16th prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.
Speaking after the oath, Rathore said, “First of all, I thank God from my heart for bestowing this heavy responsibility on my weak shoulders.”
The newly sworn-in premier said fulfilling those duties would not be an “easy task in this extremely difficult era”, but said he believed God gave strength to those entrusted with such tasks.
 


Rathore also thanked President Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur, saying that owing to them, not only was a “new government established, but the PPP has again become one of the biggest parties” in AJK.
The PPP leader termed AJK a “basecamp” of the freedom movement for Kashmir. “It aims to cultivate this movement and fully play its role in it while staying here,” he said.
The new premier highlighted that another key point was the region’s development and progress. He paid tribute to the martyrs of the freedom movement and the soldiers on the Line of Control.
 
 

Rathore also recalled that in 1975, ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had chosen his father late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore as a senior minister, and later in 1990, ex-PM Benazir Bhutto chose him as the AJK premier “despite him being a part of a small community in the PPP”.
“And now, in 2025, the party leadership trusted me and sent me into this field,” Rathore added. He went on to affirm that this “relationship of trust based on half a decade” would remain between him and his party.
‘Six months are a test’
PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also spoke on the occasion, urging the people to work together with his party. He also called for the restoration of open courts in the region.
Pointing out that elections were due in AJK in six months, he asked the PPP’s head in the region, Chaudhry Yasin, to start preparing for the polls.
He further assured that the PPP would not run the government from “closed rooms”.
“We will sit among the public, meet them, join their political struggle, and resolve their problems.”
He further stated: “These six months are a test. After this test, we will […] again get the people’s mandate and again lead this government. And we will show the world that when we work together […] when we don’t fight among ourselves, how my Kashmir progresses on the global stage.”
The PPP chairman then went on to call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “coward”, saying that he had been “hiding his face from the world” following the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May. Meanwhile, Bilawal said, Pakistan’s diplomatic standing had improved.
He also slammed Modi over a “conspiracy to undermine the relationship between Pakistan and the people of Azad Kashmir”.
“I want to tell Modi that you lost the war, and God willing, this conspiracy of yours will also be unsuccessful. No one can undermine the relationship between the PPP and the public of Azad Kashmir,” Bilawal added.
Prosperity of AJK’s people among Centre’s priorities: Shehbaz
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly elected Rathore that the prosperity and progress of the region were among the federal government’s top priorities.

In a phone call, PM Shehbaz conveyed his heartfelt congratulations to Rathore on being chosen as the new premier of AJK, state-run PTV News reported.
“The progress and prosperity of AJK’s people are among the federal government’s priorities,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.
He further assured Rathore that the Centre was determined to work with the AJK government for the “welfare, economic development, prosperity, and peace and security” of the region’s public.
PM Shehbaz pledged that the federal government will provide “every possible cooperation” to the AJK set-up. He also expressed his best wishes to the PM-elect for his tenure.
 






Rathore is AJK’s fourth premier in the last four years, and the 16th since 1975 when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The no-confidence vote against Chaudhry had sailed through on Monday with 36 votes from PPP and PML-N members, while two PTI opposition members voted against it.
Under the AJK Constitution, a note of no-confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
After his election yesterday, the 47-year-old PM-elect announced several administrative measures, including a downsizing process, a new transport policy for officials, and limiting the number of secretaries to 20. He also pledged to address public issues and cater to the needs of low-paid staff.</p><small>2025-11-18 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18070808c834b5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955653/pakistan-calls-for-ending-occupation-of-palestine-after-unsc-adopts-resolution-on-gaza-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for ending occupation of Palestine after UNSC adopts resolution on Gaza peace plan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad stressed on Monday the need for ending the occupation of Palestinian territories and paving the way for Palestinian statehood through a credible political process.
“We believe that in order to break the cycle of violence, it is absolutely necessary to end the occupation, and to have a political horizon, open the pathway to the Palestinian State through a credible, time-bound political process firmly anchored in the relevant UN resolutions,” he said while speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) after it adopt a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza.
The plan also authorises an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for the Palestinian enclave.
Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained — notable given earlier signals that Moscow might veto the text.
Israel and Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution approved by the Security Council is seen as vital to legitimising a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.
Pakistan said it voted in favour of the resolution in order to halt the fighting, protect civilians, and reinforce a ceasefire that could open the way to humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave.
Ambassador Ahmad explained that Islamabad backed the plan with one overriding purpose: “To stop the bloodshed, to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, to maintain the ceasefire, and to secure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.”
 






He said Pakistan’s vote was guided by the position of the Palestinians, the Arab Group, and the eight-nation Arab-Islamic grouping — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and Türkiye — which endorsed Trump’s initiative earlier this year.
“Our vote has been guided by the position of Palestine and the Arab Group,” he said, adding that the joint engagement was aimed at ending the conflict, ensuring humanitarian access, preventing displacement, and supporting “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
The ambassador noted that Pakistan worked actively during negotiations, supporting Arab amendments and proposing its own changes to ensure the text aligned with “international legitimacy” on the Palestinian question.
He welcomed the inclusion of some proposals, such as the explicit call for maintaining the ceasefire and the requirement for regular reporting to the UNSC, but said several critical issues remained unaddressed.
“A clear political path to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, the central role of the Palestinian Authority in governance and reconstruction, and enhanced involvement of the UN … are crucial aspects,” he said.
“We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity,” he added.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent policy that any peace initiative must lead to a sovereign, independent and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He underscored that existing UNSC resolutions “remain fully valid,” cautioning that the new resolution should not “alter or diminish” the body of established international law on the conflict.
He stressed that the right to self-determination is “inherent and unconditional … and cannot be subjected to any conditions”.
The ambassador said the proposed Board of Peace must remain a temporary oversight mechanism whose mandate expires in 2027 unless renewed.
“Executive and administrative authority in Gaza must remain with the Palestinians through a Palestinian Committee,” he added.
He insisted that the Palestinian Authority must play a central role in governance and reconstruction.
“Peace cannot be achieved by bypassing the Palestinians. There must be an end to policies that undermine and weaken the Palestinian Authority,“ he said.
Talking about the ISF, Ahmad said it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority.
He warned that unilateral violations of the ceasefire could “threaten and thwart the entire process”, and emphasised that the ISF’s mandate would only be effective “once there is complete Israeli withdrawal”.
Referring to the scale of devastation in Gaza, the ambassador said more than 69,000 Palestinians had been killed over the past two years.
A “ray of hope,” he said, had emerged with the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh in October — where Egypt, Qatar, Türkiye and the United States signed the peace agreement that underpins the current plan.
The UN envoy urged the international community to uphold its responsibilities and support a credible, time-bound process towards Palestinian statehood. He stressed that there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement” and that the territorial contiguity of the West Bank and Gaza was essential for a viable state.
 
 

Looking ahead, he said the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people must play central roles in governance, reconstruction and institution-building.
At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people.
“Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation.
In a post on X afterwards, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “Looking ahead, the central roles of the United Nations, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people are vital in ensuring legitimate governance, reconstruction, and institution building in Gaza.
“The international community must stand with them steadfastly and firmly.”
 






Adoption of the resolution
The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.
It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.
Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution.
Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass.
After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision a “historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region.
“Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely.
He emphasised that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.”
Hamas rejects resolution
Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.
 
 

“Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught, sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023.
The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced.
That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel.
“Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.</p><small>2025-11-18 10:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181414008ef7d85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955840/economic-coordination-committee-approves-grants-for-security-defence-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Economic Coordination Committee approves grants for security, defence projects</strong></a><br><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Tuesday approved grants pertaining to Pakistan’s security and defence.
In a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a meeting of the ECC that was attended by federal ministers, special assistants to the prime minister, secretaries, and senior officials from relevant divisions.
It said the ECC approved “several strategic grants and reforms aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s security framework, defence capabilities, food security, and petroleum sector operations”.
 






According to the ministry’s statement, a technical supplementary grant of Rs100.3 million was approved for the maintenance of defence equipment used by the federal civil armed forces.
A technical supplementary grant of Rs841.56m was also approved for enhanced border management, internal security and law and order. Further, a technical supplementary grant of Rs50 billion was also approved for defence services projects.
The ECC also decided to establish a new special purpose vehicle, with initial paid-up capital of Rs1,000,000, to take forward the winding up of Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation, along with “measures to incentivise foreign participation in offshore oil and gas exploration, including licence extensions and working interest assignments”.
Finmin meets delegation representing group founded by tech entrepreneurs
Separately, Finance Minister Aurangzeb held a meeting with a high-level delegation representing Dialog, an invite-only network founded by tech entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman.
In a handout, the ministry said the delegation was led by Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui and also included UK House of Lords Member Simon Stevens, Austrian MP Veit Valentin Dengler, Norwegian MP Himanshu Gulati, Jigsaw Chief Executive Officer Yasmin Green, Xbox-Microsoft Vice President Fatima Kardar and others.
The ministry said that during the meeting, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s economic reforms.
 






He also stressed the government’s focus on tax reform, energy sector restructuring, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, governance reforms, and rationalisation of federal expenditures.
“He emphasised efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base by integrating technology and artificial intelligence-based monitoring, enhancing compliance, and bringing under-taxed sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale/retail into the tax net,” the press release said.
The minister also discussed ongoing pension reforms, including the shift to contributory schemes for new entrants and upcoming measures to tackle long-term fiscal liabilities.
Aurangzeb outlined governance improvements in electricity distribution companies, loss-reduction initiatives, private-sector representation on boards, and a renewed privatisation pipeline.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a competitive tariff regime, long-term sustainability, and greater private-sector participation,” the handout said.</p><small>2025-11-18 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061820327ff0934.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949720/she-never-got-her-period-and-no-one-told-her-why' target='_blank'><strong>She never got her period, and no one told her why</strong></a><br><p>G* and her family didn’t notice anything unusual about her until her 16th birthday. Ten days later, she was seated alongside her aunt at a clinic in Hunza, her hometown, on their third visit. She hadn’t gotten her period yet.
For the next several years, the duo travelled across Gilgit-Baltistan, visiting one doctor after another. Every time they visited a clinic, G* underwent a battery of tests, x-rays and ultrasounds. There was no issue except that she could not bear children, the doctors told them. It’s genetic; not much could be done, they said, insisting that the rest was all good.
But what they failed to tell G* would shape the rest of her life. By the time she found out, she was 36 and divorced. G* was diagnosed with a rare condition, the Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where a woman has no womb or vagina, and can also find herself with just one kidney.
A woman who has MRKH can never get periods or conceive, unless she gets a uterus transplant — an option unavailable in Pakistan at the moment. It is also an option that G* cannot afford.
A rare condition
According to Dr Novera Chughtai, clinical assistant professor at the Aga Khan University Hospital’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the genetic disorder manifests in one in 5,000 girls.
“Normally, when the embryo or foetus is six weeks old, it begins to develop genital differentiation, which is basically the distinction between whether the baby would be a boy or a girl,” said the doctor. “So technically, the lower area of the genital has to fuse with the upper part.”
The problem begins when the fusion messes up or there is a lack of it. In case of the latter, both the upper (uterus) and lower (vagina) parts of the genital tract do not develop. In cases where the fusion is delayed, the areas are both partially developed, and an even further delay may mean that areas surrounding the genital tract may be developed, but without any fusion.
For G*, the fusion did not take place, which deprived her of the ability to conceive or even partake in sexual intercourse. Like other girls, at the tender age of puberty, she was not aware of what was happening inside her.
“From birth up until the age of 11 to 13, girls are unaware whether something is wrong with them unless other systems in their bodies are also not working,” explained Dr Novera. “Usually, patients don’t even know if they have one kidney, which is common in 30 per cent of cases.”
In most cases, she continued, the syndrome and its variations only manifest when medical investigation begins. “For example, if a patient has a uterus but no vagina, they would get periods, but blood would remain inside the system in the absence of a vaginal tract.”
This often results in severe infections and severe pain.
Other patients whose uterus is malformed or rudimentary don’t report periods or pain. “In these cases, parents bring the girls with concerns that while they were otherwise healthy, they hadn’t gotten their period despite reaching the age of puberty.”
In both instances, the genital area is both visually and functionally malformed.
Ignorance is not always bliss
G*, who grew up with an aged grandfather after her mother’s demise, did not have the guidance or support to understand this until her aunt moved in with her. She recalled to Dawn how growing up, she always felt different from other girls in her village — as if a big part of life was missing.
G* didn’t try too hard to fit in either, and so she engrossed herself in housework, and music helped her create a world of her own, where she felt she belonged.
But life has its own way, and G’s* world almost toppled when she got married and was unable to consummate because of her vaginal deformities. “The first time I got married, my husband passed away within just a couple of days,” she recalled to Dawn.
Her second marriage brought another heartbreak. Unable to consummate, her husband flew her down to Karachi for scans and X-rays. “After the results came out, he took me to Hunza and then returned, saying that he would come back to take me home,” she said. A few days later, he faxed divorce papers to her house. It had been exactly one month since their marriage.
Word soon spread across her village as well. “They started calling me khusra behind my back … they said I am neither a man nor a woman … they started blaming me for the divorce,” G* shared.
The constant chatter got to her, pushing her into a deep and dark abyss of depression. At first, she did what most do: distraction. “I took up the job of a nanny at a big house in the nearby village, which would keep me busy throughout the day.”
The depression and isolation G* experienced is the story of most other women who suffer from the syndrome. “The stigma surrounding the condition is prevalent in our society because it is linked to the reproductive organs of a woman,” highlighted Dr Novera.
She recalled receiving cases where patients kept trying intercourse and ruptured their rectum in the process because they didn’t know what was happening to them. They only visit a doctor when the problem escalates into “bache nahi ho rahe”.
“This is a part of our infertility workup,” the doctor stressed, “there is so much ignorance.”
Part of this also comes from early marriages in Pakistan, as pointed out by Dr Lubna Razzak, a gynaecologist at the Dow University Hospital. “Women mostly get married in their early years, around 16-18,” she lamented.
“They are then coming to us with their husbands with the complaint of being unable to consummate the marriage, oblivious to the fact that they never got their period. It all comes down to either not being able to have intercourse or infertility.”
The treatment and its kinds
The distraction of work couldn’t stymie G*’s growing questions. In December last year, she travelled to Karachi to seek answers. By January, her treatment had begun; on March 6, she underwent surgery to expand her vaginal opening, allowing for sexual intercourse — though she still cannot bear children.
According to Dr Novera, the treatment of patients with MRKH syndrome is dependent on their condition. “If there is a uterus but no outflow, we operate then and there,” she told Dawn, adding that in such cases, girls are young and usually do not understand what is happening to them.
“The process includes internal vaginal examinations and post-operation care, all of which can be traumatising.”
On the other hand, when it comes to a patient without a uterus, there is an understanding that they won’t get periods. In such cases, surgery is done to create the patient’s vaginal tract, which, as the doctor explained, was basically an injury to the natural body.
“When you get a bruise or cut, it is natural for the wound to be filled over time, just like cuts and incisions heal,” Dr Novera said. “But with the vaginal tract, for it to remain open, it must be constantly used.” Hence, for such patients, this treatment is advised before marriage.
In G*’s case, the procedure, which included all aspects of vaginal construction, involved collaboration with laparoscopic surgeons, adolescent gynaecologists and plastic surgeons. While it was not life-threatening, the surgery could end up becoming complicated because the bladder and rectum — both near the vaginal area — could be at risk of being hurt in the process.
“Sometimes, you could do your best, but the vagina would still start blocking.” This is because the syndrome is rare and manifests differently for everyone. “The success rate, therefore, depends on the post-op care,” Dr Novera emphasised.
And, she continued, there are two sides to the post-op care: one is the anatomical follow-up and the other is psychological counselling. The latter is not just restricted to the patient, but also extends to her partner, if she has one.
One part of the counselling involves explaining the dos and don’ts of sexual intercourse to the partner and making them understand why it is important to be careful. The other side of it, meanwhile, helps the couple deal with the social pressures that come with the condition.
From her experience, Dr Lubna told Dawn, patients from upper socio-economic backgrounds have a sense of understanding that life can be lived without a child. “But it is extremely difficult to explain the same to patients from the middle or lower classes because they equate a woman’s life to her uterus.”
This, she said, added to the patient’s trauma. “So we have to counsel the patients slowly and gradually … not just them but also the partner and the family, all the while using the right words.”
In a society where womanhood is equated with motherhood, support and empathy are often missing — leaving women like G* to fight their battles largely alone.
And so, in many cases, the revelation of the diagnosis leads to the partner opting for a second marriage. Hence, many patients try to hide their condition from their partners — a trend both Dr Lubna and Dr Novera have seen.
Fighting the taboo
Part of the blame for the reaction the condition receives also lies in the lack of awareness among people — not just about the MRKH syndrome, but also women’s reproductive health.
“So far, at the AKUH, we are looking at 10 cases per year because there is a lot of referral system from neighbouring cities, provinces and even cities such as Iran and Afghanistan,” said Dr Novera. “And from what we have seen, patients are not aware of the syndrome themselves.”
To mitigate this, the AKUH holds conferences and training sessions at hospitals such as the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, along with using social media to raise awareness.
Dr Novera added that there was a lack of training even among doctors, who fail to realise or identify what kind of case they are dealing with. Thirdly, patients with financial constraints usually end up at smaller clinics and hospitals that lack investigative capabilities, even basic MRI and CT scan machines.
This is exactly what happened with G*, who kept running from one clinic to the other for years. She was only able to afford the treatment at the AKUH because of the funds she secured from a donor. The surgery itself costs anywhere between Rs700,000 to Rs800,000.
At public hospitals such as Dow, the same is more affordable, ranging between Rs250,000 to Rs300,000, said Dr Lubna.
Life for G* has changed since her vaginoplasty, for which she keeps travelling between Karachi and Hunza. She has been prescribed a couple of exercises to ensure that her vaginal tract remains open and functional until she gets married.
Ever since her treatment, G’s* family has begun looking for a groom. The 36-year-old, whose previous experience in this regard still gives her tremors, has her own set of fears, but along with them is also a newfound hope and confidence.
“I know none of this [the syndrome] is something I have control over,” she told Dawn. “And I also know that this doesn’t define me … whoever wants to marry me will do so while accepting this.” In the meantime, G* continues her job, which is no longer a distraction.
“I have realised I love children and being around them brings me a lot of joy,” she said. “It finally feels like there is something to look forward to in life.”</p><small>2025-11-18 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1814583202c41d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955838/3-key-judicial-bodies-reconstituted-in-light-of-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>3 key judicial bodies reconstituted in light of 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>As the dust settles after the passage of the 27th Amendment Constitutional Amendment, changes have been made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, Supreme Court’s  Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has been included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while Federal Constitutional Court’s (FCC)  Justice Aamer Farooq has been made a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
Changes in their composition were required to synchronise them with the latest constitutional amendment.
A Supreme Court (SC) press release issued on Tuesday said: “Pursuant to the 27th Constitutional Amendment, [these] key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies […] have been reconstituted in accordance with the revised constitutional framework.”
Elaborating on the changes in the bodies’ composition, the press release said that Justice Mandokahail, being the second-most senior judge of the SC, had been jointly nominated by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan as a member of the SJC.
Now, apart from Justice Mandokhail, the SJC will comprise the CJP, FCC CJ Aminuddin, Justice Munib Akhtar of the SC, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi of the FCC, Lahore High Court (LHC) CJ Aalia Neelum and Islamabad High Court (IHC) CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
According to the 27th Amendment, the SJC will be headed by the senior most judge between the CJP and FCC chief justice. The inter-se seniority in this case will be determined by the dates of their appointment as the chief justices of the SC and FCC. This means that CJP Yahya will continue to head the body.
The SC press release also added that the two judges had nominated Justice Mandokhail as a member of Practice and Procedure Committee.
Under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Act 2023, the three-judge committee will now comprise the CJP, Justice Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail, who has become the second-most senior judge following the resignation of Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
According to the SC press release, Justice Farooq, the second most senior judge of the FCC, was jointly nominated by the chief justices of the SC and FCC as a member of the JCP.
Following this, the JCP will now comprise the CJP, FCC chief justice, Justice Akhtar, FCC’s Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members from the National Assembly, two members from the Senate and a woman or non-Muslim nominated by the National Assembly speaker.
“The reconstituted bodies will continue to play a central role in matters of accountability, judicial appointments, and procedural governance under the amended constitutional scheme,” the press release read.
The changes in the bodies’ composition come amid a restructuring of the judiciary following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the FCC, was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry. It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethroning the SS as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Hours after the Amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC had resigned, citing their reservations against it. These two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
ICJ’s reservations
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has also expressed concern over several main points of the Amendment, namely the formation of the FCC, the appointment of judges and chief justices to the SC and the FCC, the composition of the JCP, the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the (ICJ) statement issued on Nov 13 read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-18 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1813292666f5af1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955835/girl-18-found-dead-in-dha-karachi-relatives-detained-for-suspected-involvement' target='_blank'><strong>Girl, 18, found dead in DHA Karachi; relatives detained for suspected involvement</strong></a><br><p>A newlywed 18-year-old girl was found dead in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area while the police detained her relatives for their suspected involvement for interrogation, officials said on Tuesday.
“The girl was married to a government employee deputed at Malir Cantonment; she was found dead at the rooftop of a building in Badar Commercial in Phase 5,” South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
The senior officer added that a dupatta was knotted around her neck twice.
She was immediately taken to a private clinic in DHA and later to a hospital in Clifton, where doctors pronounced her dead. Subsequently, DIG Raza detailed, her body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal proceedings.
The couple had arrived in Karachi from Sialkot two weeks ago and was residing at an aunt’s house in the Badar Commercial area.
According to details shared by the DIG, the girl reportedly went to the rooftop on Monday evening and did not return.
When her aunt went upstairs, she found the girl unconscious near a water tank with her neck knotted with a dupatta. She called her son and went to the hospital.
The father of the deceased girl (who is also a government employee) arrived at JPMC on Monday night and alleged that it was a murder by strangulation.
“The aunt’s sons are found suspects in this case and detained for interrogation,” said the senior officer.
The South police head said they are waiting for the doctors’ final report.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “We have strong suspicions about sexual violence,” adding that all samples have been collected. She said the cause of death was constriction of the neck.</p><small>2025-11-18 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18130718db5a38e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955836/lhc-bars-police-from-harrassing-indian-woman-married-to-pakistani-man' target='_blank'><strong>LHC bars police from harrassing Indian woman married to Pakistani man</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday barred the police from harassing an Indian woman who had filed a petition against them.
The woman, formerly Sikh, had come to Pakistan for religious purposes but had converted to Islam to marry the second petitioner, her now-husband. She complained that the police had conducted an “illegal raid on their house in Farooqabad, Sheikhupura district, and pressured her to end the marriage.”
The petition was heard by Justice Farooq Haider, who ordered the police to stop harassing the petitioners.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was filed on November 12 under Article 199 (jurisdiction of High Court) of the Constitution. It named both the woman and her husband as the petitioners and Punjab’s inspector general of police (IGP), the regional police officer of Sheikhupura, the district police officers (DPOs) of Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib, the station house officers (SHOs) of the same, and another resident of Farooq Abad as respondents.
The petition alleged that, based on the woman’s former religion, this other resident had requested the SHOs to conduct an illegal raid on the petitioners’ home twice, on November 8 and 11. It said the SHOs caused “undue harassment towards them” and forced them to dissolve the marriage.
The petition added, “The police functionaries are duty-bound to provide legal protection as guaranteed by Article 35 of the Constitution … the state is duty-bound to protect the life and liberty of spouses.” In addition to Article 35 (protection of family, etc), it also cited Article 9 (security of person) to argue that no person should be deprived of life or liberty except in accordance with the law.
It also said that the husband was a citizen of Pakistan, while his wife had also approached the embassy to extend her visa and obtain Pakistani nationality.
The petition submitted that the respondents’ actions were “against the law and fundamental rights” and severely infringed on the petitioners’ rights. It added that the petitioners would suffer “irreparable loss and injury” if the court did not issue a proper direction restraining the respondents from causing undue harassment.
It requested the LHC to “graciously” direct the respondents not to cause undue harassment to the petitioners and “not to interfere [with] the matrimonial life of the petitioners”, as well as any other relief the court deemed fit.
A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in August found an alarming rise in violence against religious minorities during the last year, including the targeted killing of Ahmadis and extra-judicial killings by the police of those accused of blasphemy. The HRCP underscored the urgent need for reform within law enforcement and accountability mechanisms.</p><small>2025-11-18 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18120339809ae19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955829/us-is-the-biggest-recipient-of-chinese-loans-study-shows' target='_blank'><strong>US is the biggest recipient of Chinese loans, study shows</strong></a><br><p>The United States is the biggest recipient of China’s lending activities globally, according to a study that tracked Beijing’s credit activities and found it is increasingly lending to higher-income countries over developing countries.
The report, published on Tuesday by AidData, a research lab at US university William & Mary, said China’s lending and grant giving totalled $2.2 trillion across 200 countries in every region of the world from 2000 to 2023.
During this period, Pakistan received $74 billion, the report shows, ranking it as the fifth largest recipient.
China has long been seen as a creditor to developing countries through its Belt and Road initiative, but is shifting toward lending to advanced economies — backing strategic infrastructure and high‑tech supply chains in areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and clean energy.
Beijing’s portfolio size is two-to-four times larger than previous estimates suggest, AidData said, adding that China remains the world’s largest official creditor.
More than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now support projects and activities in upper-middle-income countries and high-income countries.
“Much of the lending to wealthy countries is focused on critical infrastructure, critical minerals and the acquisition of high-tech assets like semiconductor companies,” said lead author Brad Parks, AidData’s executive director.
The United States received the most official sector credit from China, more than $200bn for nearly 2,500 projects and activities, the report said.
Chinese state-owned entities are “active in every corner and sector of the US”, bankrolling the construction of liquefied natural gas projects in Texas and Louisiana, data centres in Northern Virginia, terminals at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the Matterhorn Express Natural Gas pipeline and the Dakota Access Oil pipeline, AidData said.
Beijing has financed the acquisition of high-tech companies while Chinese state-owned creditors have provided credit facilities for many Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, AT&T, Verizon, Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Boeing and Disney, the report said.
The share of lending to low and lower-middle income countries fell to 12 per cent in 2023 from 88pc in 2000.
Beijing has also cut lending for infrastructure projects in the “Global South”, under its Belt and Road Initiative.
At the same time, it has ramped up its share that supports middle-income and high-income countries to 76pc in 2023 from 24pc in 2000. The United Kingdom, for instance, received $60bn, while the European Union got $161bn.</p><small>2025-11-18 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18114728d926e01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955828/terrorist-killed-in-failed-attempt-to-blow-up-bridge-in-bannu-after-ied-detonates-prematurely' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist killed in failed attempt to blow up bridge in Bannu after IED detonates prematurely</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists’ bid to blow up a bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district failed on Tuesday when an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated prematurely while it was being installed, police said.
Amir Khan, the spokesperson for the District Police Office in Bannu, told Dawn that two terrorists intended to blow up Doghoda Bridge. He said that one of them died on the spot when the IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.
The other terrorist was injured and escaped the scene, he added.
The spokesperson said police had reached the spot and were collecting evidence. Meanwhile, the process for the identification of the dead terrorist had also been initiated, he said.
A search operation was also under way to track down the other terrorist, he added.
Today’s incident comes around a month after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Bannu.
According to police, terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance in the October 19 incident.
But, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement, preventing the terrorists from coming near the police station. Eventually, the terrorists fled, a police statement said.
In a similar incident on October 17, three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Bannu late at night.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18095705985e07b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955818/15-terrorists-killed-in-two-intelligence-based-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>15 terrorists killed in two intelligence-based operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday that 15 terrorists were killed in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
First, an IBO was conducted by security forces in Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
“We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1811041743e27aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955824/vitol-cnergyico-make-pakistans-biggest-single-delivery-of-marine-fuel' target='_blank'><strong>Vitol, Cnergyico make Pakistan’s biggest single delivery of marine fuel</strong></a><br><p>Vitol and Cnergyico, Pakistan’s largest oil refiner, have delivered the country’s biggest single shipment of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for ship refuelling, the global trading firm said in a statement late Monday.
The move will enable large vessels refuelling in Pakistan to now sail longer routes from east to west without needing to stop elsewhere, while also giving the country a stronger local supply of environmentally compliant marine fuel.
This shipment came from Cnergyico’s first large-scale batch of fuel that meets International Maritime Organisation (IMO) low-sulphur rules. The company began producing it after importing its first US crude oil cargoes earlier this year.
Vitol delivered the VLSFO to a vessel owned and operated by shipping major MSC at Port Qasim, using a Singapore-flagged bunker barge Marine Ista that has the capacity to supply 6,800 metric tons of marine fuel in a single delivery.
It was also the first barge to load fuel directly from the Karachi Port Trust’s Oil Pier rather than through truck deliveries.
Cnergyico will continue providing Vitol with this cleaner marine fuel, according to Vitol.
“This latest initiative enhances Pakistan’s capacity to serve the global shipping industry with sustainable fuel solutions,” said Aumar Abbassciy, director at Cnergyico Pk Limited.
Vitol’s new bunker locations in Pakistan will include Karachi Port, Port Qasim, and Karachi Anchorage, according to Vitol’s bunker trading and marketing manager Ammar Hussaini.</p><small>2025-11-18 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18103222af80dde.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955694/police-step-up-search-and-strike-operations-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Police step up search and strike operations in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Police have intensified search and strike operations in Lower South Waziristan keeping in view the recent security situation and emerging threats in the region.
As part of these measures, District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Tahir Shah Wazir visited various localities here on Monday and reviewed effectiveness of the ongoing operations.
He inspected security arrangements at multiple units, checkpoints and police installations, expressing satisfaction over the preparedness of the force. He met officers and personnel on duty.
Speaking to police personnel, the DPO said that the prevailing security environment demanded utmost vigilance from every officer. Even minor negligence could lead to severe consequences, he said.
 
 

He also inspected surrounding residential areas, streets and all entry and exit points during his visit to police lines in Sholam. He directed relevant officers to keep strict watch on any suspicious movement and ensure that rapid response mechanisms were in place to deal with potential threats.
Mr Wazir also reviewed surveillance system installed at checkpoints and on the premises of DPO office. He examined live and recorded footage of the cameras monitoring internal and external routes.
He instructed the monitoring staff to keep all cameras fully functional, maintain continuous surveillance and promptly report any unusual activity. He directed them to keep the monitoring room active round-the-clock.
The DPO arranged special briefings for officers and personnel deployed at various checkpoints. He ordered thorough checking of all vehicles and individuals, saying that the verification process must be comprehensive and effective. He instructed policemen to remain prepared for swift and coordinated action in case of any emergency.
He said that modern technology, improved policing strategies and community cooperation were essential for establishing lasting peace in the district.
The DPO reaffirmed the commitment of police force to maintaining law and order in the district. “Ensuring sustainable peace and security in the district remains our foremost priority. Police force is fully committed, professionally prepared and dedicated to safeguarding people,” he said.

“I will say that we will be doing that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We’ll be selling the F-35s.”
A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington’s definition of maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
 






Saudi Arabia has requested to buy as many as 48 F-35 fighters, a potential multibillion-dollar deal that has cleared a key Pentagon hurdle ahead of bin Salman’s visit, Reuters reported early this month.
The Saudis have long been interested in Lockheed Martin’s LMT.N fighter.
A senior White House official told Reuters before Trump spoke that the president wanted to talk to the crown prince about the jets, “then we’ll make a determination”.
Personal appeal
Saudi Arabia, the largest customer for US arms, has sought the fighter for years as it looks to modernise its air force and counter regional threats, particularly from Iran.
The kingdom’s renewed push for what would constitute two squadrons comes as the Trump administration has signaled openness to deepening defence cooperation with Riyadh.
The Saudi Air Force flies a mix of fighter aircraft, including Boeing BA.N F-15s, European Tornados and Typhoons.
Saudi Arabia made a direct appeal to buy the jets earlier this year to Trump.
The Pentagon’s policy department worked on the potential transaction for months, US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had previously told Reuters.
Washington weighs weapons sales to the Middle East in a way that ensures Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge”. This guarantees that Israel gets more advanced US weapons than regional Arab states.
The F-35, built with stealth technology that allows it to evade enemy detection, is considered the world’s most advanced fighter jet. Israel has operated the aircraft for nearly a decade, building multiple squadrons, and remains the only Middle Eastern country to possess the weapons system.
The F-35 issue has also been intertwined with broader diplomatic efforts. The Biden administration previously explored providing F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a comprehensive deal that would have included Riyadh normalising relations with Israel, though those efforts ultimately stalled.
Congressional scrutiny could pose challenges to any F-35 sale. Lawmakers previously questioned arms deals with Riyadh following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some members of Congress remain wary of deepening military cooperation with the kingdom.</p><small>2025-11-18 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691b7c6ead0f9.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955713/pm-promises-revival-of-karachi-circular-railway-with-sindh-govts-help' target='_blank'><strong>PM promises revival of Karachi Circular Railway with Sindh govt’s help</strong></a><br><p>• On CM Murad’s request, Shehbaz assures inclusion of Karachi Circular Railway in CPEC

He also promised to upgrade and modernise all railway stations across the province and the country.
He said that the digitisation and modernisation of Pakistan Railways and the provision of state-of-the-art facilities would play a key role in strengthening the national economy.
The prime minister expressed these views while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the new Shalimar Express and the newly upgraded waiting rooms, CIP lounge at Karachi Cantonment Railway Station.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and others were present on the occasion.
Responding to CM Shah’s request to include the KCR project in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the prime minister assured full cooperation, calling it a vital initiative.
He said he had flagged the KCR project at every international forum and “we would jointly revive it as this project was inevitable for the people of Karachi”.
He hoped this project would soon become a reality.
The PM said the Shalimar Express running between Karachi and Lahore has been converted into a new, upgraded train.
He described Karachi as not only the economic hub but also the heart of Pakistan.
‘54 railway stations modernised’
The prime minister said that 54 railway stations had already been modernised.
He said that soon after assuming office, Railways Minister Abbasi worked diligently to modernise the railway system. “After revamping Lahore Railway Station, now Karachi Cantt Station has also been upgraded with contemporary facilities.”
He said that all railway stations in Sindh would be modernised in coordination with the provincial government to ensure better travel facilities for the passengers.
He said like Sindh and Punjab, such coordination with the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan should be evolved, which would ultimate make the railways the best transport system of this region.
He said the federal government would work with all provinces to extend the railway network to Central Asia, specifically highlighting the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway line project.
He reiterated that cooperation with all provincial governments would continue to ensure modernisation across the railway network and help stabilise the economy.
He said the railway’s freight system was also being organised.
The PM said the federal and Sindh governments hade a partnership to provide transportation for Thar Coal, with both governments investing 50 per cent each in the project.
He assured that all required funds would be released in this regard so that the set targets of the projects could be achieved.
He also emphasised reviving the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail route, saying this would boost the economy.
He noted that Mr Abbasi had initiated discussions with the Asian Development Bank for a $2 billion loan to further upgrade the railway line from Karachi to Rohri. He said that eventually it would be connected to the Reko Diq project.
Praising the services of Mr Abbasi, he said once all stations, big or small, are upgraded he would recommend a presidential award for him.
Calling him the hero of today’s ceremony, he congratulated the minister for transforming the outdated railway system.
Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Mr Abbasi said that significant improvements were achieved in just eight months, including the modernisation of Karachi Cantt Station and the renewal of the Shalimar Express.
He added that Rs1 billion was being spent on upgrading the Rohri Station, while work was also underway at Karachi City Station.
Mr Abbasi said that 14 trains were being outsourced under a government policy and railway hospitals and schools were also being given to private administration, while ensuring full protection for railway employees. “Work on the ML-1 project is also progressing,” he added.
Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah welcomed the prime minister to Karachi and reaffirmed full cooperation from the provincial government.
He appealed to the PM for federal support in establishing the KCR project. “A large-scale project like the KCR cannot be completed by the Sindh government alone,” he said.
He reaffirmed the Sindh government’s commitment to fully cooperate with federal authorities and the railways to ensure the successful implementation of the project.
He expressed gratitude to the PM and Minister Abbasi and emphasised that upgrading railway lines and branches was a positive development for Sindh’s residents.
The CM Shah pointed out that, until the Karachi-Hyderabad motorway is completed, train travel remains the most viable public transport option.
He called for expedited federal efforts to finish the motorway, reiterating that improved regional connectivity will greatly benefit thousands of commuters daily.
Earlier, the prime minister inaugurated the new Shalimar Express at Karachi Cantt Station by cutting the ribbon and unveiling the plaque. He visited the upgraded waiting area, CIP lounge, state-of-the-art dining hall and computerised ticketing system.
Mr Abbasi briefed the prime minister regarding modernisation and upgradation of the railways.
The ceremony was also attended by foreign diplomats and parliamentarians, senior officers from the federal as well as provincial governments.

• Connecting Central and South Asia markets ‘central objective’ for both nations
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided on Monday to establish a joint committee comprising the drug regulatory authorities of both countries and the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Association (PMA) to fast-track solutions aimed at boosting pharma-related trade between the two nations.The agreement was reached during the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Cooperation’s 8th Review Session, chaired by Haroon Akhtar Khan, the special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) on industries and production.
The meeting was attended by Uz­­bek Ambassador Alisher Takhta­yev, as well as senior representatives from the federal and provincial governments, the Special Investment Facilitation Council, the business community, and diplomatic missions.
During the meeting, both sides held comprehensive discussions on expanding bilateral cooperation in key sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, surgical instruments, mining, and information technology.
 






In line with the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan is accelerating its efforts to achieve the target of $2 billion in bilateral trade with Uzbekistan.
Mr Takhtayev reaffirmed his country’s resolve to deepen regional integration, stating that connecting the markets of Central and South Asia remained a central objective for both nations.
It was decided that a body should be set up that includes the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, its Uzbek counterpart and the PMA to bolster the pharma trade between the two countries.  The issue of slow certification of Pakistani medicines in Uzbekistan was raised by pharmaceutical stakeholders. In response, SAPM Khan assured the stakeholders that the certification process would be expedited.
Aviation ties
Aviation connectivity was another significant point of discussion.
The Uzbek ambassador expressed his interest in initiating direct flights from Karachi to his country, highlighting the potential for enhanced trade and tourism.
SAPM Khan emphasised that Pakistan-Uzbekistan air links were essential for unlocking commercial and travel opportunities. He added that Uzbekistan could serve as a new gateway for travel between the Gulf region and Europe.
Banking cooperation
The meeting also underscored the urgent need to strengthen banking cooperation between the two countries. The Uzbek side pointed out that the existing banking barriers were affecting trade transactions. Pakistan reiterated that financial integration was essential to sustaining economic cooperation.
Representatives of the State Bank of Pakistan assured the other side that banking challenges would soon be resolved and shared that several local banks were ready to facilitate bilateral trade.
It was announced that the National Bank of Pakistan would open a branch in Uzbekistan, enabling smoother financial operations for businesses on both sides.

The party has challenged the notification issued on Oct 24 by interior ministry that placed the party in the First Schedule of proscribed organisations under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal in this regard was ratified by the federal cabinet.
Since the party under the regulations has the right to appeal to a review committee comprising interior and law ministry officers within 30 days, the TLP moved the appeal before the expiry of the deadline.
 
 

The petition argues the SRO No 2011(I)/2025 was issued without due consideration of earlier administrative and legal actions. It contains supporting documents annexed with the application including the 2021 notification of proscription, its restoration as a political entity by the ECP, the subsequent notification removing TLP from the proscribed list, and an ‘agreement’ between the federal government and the party.
Advocates Burhan Moazzam Malik and Sajjad Akbar Abbasi, who filed the application, maintain the ministry’s latest move contradicts earlier commitments of the government and established legal processes. The interior ministry is expected to examine the petition and accompanying record before deciding to uphold, amend, or withdraw the October notification. If the petition is rejected, the TLP has the right to move the apex court.

• Lawyers organise rally in Lahore, vow to announce next course of action soon
KARACHI/LAHORE: Days after the 27th Amendment came into effect, a petition landed in the Sindh High Court for its annulment, while a Lahore High Court judge hearing a similar plea recused himself from hearing the case due to “personal reasons”.
On the other hand, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) or­­ganised a rally in Lahore against the new amendment and vowed to hold weekly protests against the recent constitutional tweaks that established ‘a court above the Su­preme Court’, namely the Fed­eral Constitutional Court (FCC).
In the SHC, the petition filed by Barrister Ali Tahir made the federal government, the FCC chief justice and the FCC judges respondents, asking the court to declare the 27th Amendment “unconstitutional”.
 
 

The petitioner said that the recent amendment contemplated the establishment of a separate FCC and curtailment or transfer of the existing jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the high courts conferred under the articles 184 (3) and 199 of the Constitution.
“Such an attempt, if permitted to proceed, would fundamentally alter the Constitutional framework, destroy the independence of the judiciary, violate the doctrine of separation of powers and extinguish the citizens rights of access to justice and judicial review guaranteed by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,” the petitioner said. According to the petition, the FCC and the position of the FCC chief justice could not have been “constitutionally created”.
“It is inherently ultra vires, as no parallel or superior court can be established above the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Such construct would violate the basic structure of the Constitution,” it added.
Regarding the notifications throu­­gh which FCC judges were appoin­t­­ed, the petitioner claimed that “those who are pretending to hold public office under these shady notifications should also be treated as respondents in a writ of quo warranto. It is obvious that the executive wanted to build a tailor-made court for itself, which is why it rammed these notifications through within hours and filled every seat like it owned the Constitution.”
He added that out of 24 judges of the Supreme Court, FCC CJ Justice Aminduddin Khan was at number four in the seniority list, while Jus­ti­­ce Hassan Azhar Rizvi ranked ninth, Justice Aamer Farooq ranked 21st, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi ranked 23rd. It claimed that these appointments raised significant questions abo­­­ut the process, timing, and intent.
 
 

The petitioner argued that the Supreme Court itself in multiple pre­cedents, including the Attock Cem­ent case, affirmed that a regular bench of the high court retained the authority to issue declaratory relief and enforce constitutional rights.
“Any attempt to withdraw or reassign this jurisdiction to special ben­ches, particularly those constituted through executive influence, is not only unconstitutional but void ab initio. It violates the doctrine of separation of powers and undermines the principle of judicial independen­­ce, which is an essential feature of the Constitution and cannot be ame­nded even by a two-third(s) majority.”
The petition urged to strike down the amendment and subsequent action. The petitioner also moved an application before the court, asking the SHC chief justice for a full bench or larger bench comprising five senior-most judges of the SHC to hear the petition.
LHC judge recuses
Meanwhile, Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal of the Lahore High Court on Monday recused himself from hearing two separate petitions challenging the 27th Amend­ment to the Constitution.
The judge requested the chief justice to fix them before any other ap­­propriate bench, citing personal reasons.
The first petition was filed by lawyers Munir Ahmad and Mian Shab­bir Ismail through Advocate Azhar Siddique, arguing that the amendment conflicts with the basic structure and spirit of the 1973 Consti­tution. The petition alleged that the amendment distorted the country’s 60-year judicial history and tradition, maintaining that a federal constitutional court was never part of the original constitutional scheme.
The petition further argued that the current National Assembly was not a “true constituent assembly” and therefore lacked the authority to introduce such major constitutional changes. In the second plea, a citizen, Hassan Latif, challenged the 27th Amendment. The petition contended that radical changes introduced by the amendment contradicted the preamble of the Constit­ution and aimed at curtailing the powers of the Supreme Court.
LHCBA meeting
The Lahore High Court Bar Asso­ciation members held a general hou­se meeting followed by a rally agai­nst the 27th Amendment. LHCBA President Asif Nissoana presided over the meeting, which was also attended by Lahore Bar Association (LBA) President Mubashir Rehman and other lawyer leaders. During the meeting, the lawyers rejected the 27th Amendment, alleging that it weakened the Supreme Court.
Mr Niswana said a parallel constitutional court had been created under the amendment, rendering the Supreme Court ineffective. He claimed that there was no court left to protect the fundamental rights of the people. He announced that the LHCBA and the LBA would hold meetings and rallies every Thursday and a lawyers’ action committee would announce the next course of action, he added.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also addressed the meeting, saying the time had come to stand up once again as there was no other option left. He questioned the legality of the appointment of the head of the federal constitutional court made by the prime minister.
After the meeting, dozens of lawyers took out a rally from GPO Chowk to the State Bank of Pakistan on the Mall.

• Researchers from Carnegie Institution for Science find photosynthesis was taking place 800 million years earlier than previously thought
• New technology could ‘revolutionise search for extra-terrestrial life’
ISLAMABAD: Pairing cutting-edge chemistry with artificial intelligence (AI), a multidisciplinary team of scientists on Monday published fresh chemical evidence of Earth’s earliest life concealed in 3.3-billion-year-old rocks and molecular evidence that oxygen-producing photosynthesis was occurring over 800 million years earlier than previously documented.
In a ground-breaking study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from the Carnegie Institution for Science and several partner universities and institutions analysed over 400 samples, including ancient sediments, fossils, modern plants and animals, and even meteorites, to see if life’s signature still exists in rocks long after the original biomolecules are gone.
Using high-tech chemical analysis to break down both organic and inorganic materials, Michael L. Wong, Anirudh Prabhu, and colleagues trained AI to recognise chemical ‘fingerprints’ left behind by life — signals that can still be detected even after billions of years of geological wear and tear.
According to Carnegie Science, the results prove the possibility of distinguishing materials of biological origin (like microbes, plants and animals) from materials of non-living origin (like meteoritic or synthetic carbon) with over 90 per cent accuracy.
These methods teased out chemical patterns unique to biology in rocks as old as 3.3 billion years. Previously, no such traces had been found in rocks older than about 1.7 billion years. The results, therefore, roughly double the window of time in which organic molecules preserved in rocks can reveal useful information about the physiology and evolutionary relationships of their original organisms.
The work also provides molecular evidence that oxygen-producing photosynthesis (the process used by plants, algae and many microorganisms to harness sunlight) was at work at least 2.5 billion years ago. This finding extends the chemical record of photosynthesis preserved in carbon molecules by over 800 million years.
Besides helping find evidence of Earth’s earliest life, this work advances a potential way to identify traces of life beyond our planet.
Dr Robert Hazen, senior staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science, said: “Think of it like showing thousands of jigsaw puzzle pieces to a computer and asking whether the original scene was a flower or a meteorite.”
“Our results show that ancient life leaves behind more than fossils; it leaves chemical ‘echoes.’ Using machine learning, we can now reliably interpret these echoes for the first time.”
One key insight was that age makes detection harder. Younger samples from the last 500 million years retained strong biotic signals.
The results suggest that machine learning applied to degraded organic matter can help resolve long-standing debates about the evolution of life on Earth in deep time.
This method could also assist in the search for signs of extraterrestrial life. If AI can detect biotic “fingerprints” on Earth that survived billions of years, the same technique might work on Martian rocks or even samples from Jupiter’s icy moon Europa.

• Seven courtrooms arranged on IHC floors
• Three benches hear several cases on first working day
ISLAMABAD: After the swearing-in of two more judges, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) finally commenced operations on Monday, hearing a number of cases within the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises.
The day began with the oath-taking ceremony of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah inside the conference room on the ground floor of the IHC building on Constitution Avenue. The oath was administered by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, bringing the court’s existing strength to seven judges.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Earlier, the FCC chief justice had told the media that the total sanctioned strength of the court would be 13 judges. Seven courtrooms have been arranged for FCC judges on different floors of the IHC building.
After the ceremony, the formal proceedings commenced with the recitation of the Holy Quran at the main FCC courtroom situated on the first floor. Since the FCC’s arrangements are not yet complete, IHC Courtroom No. 2 has been converted into the main courtroom of the FCC chief justice, with a printed A-4 page affixed at the entrance to designate it as such.
Meanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar will continue holding court in his original Courtroom No. 1, located above the FCC’s main courtroom.
Formal proceedings began at 10:12am, with Bench-I hearing around five cases in half an hour. During the hearing, those present in the courtroom could hear discomforting sounds such as the dragging of furniture.
“With the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) refusing to hand over its building, and the FCC already reeling from myriad teething problems due to sharing its establishment with the IHC, this is the only court in the country without a formal building of its own,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity. He added that even the rooms allocated for law officers have yet to be refurbished.
He further confided that there was a strong possibility that the IHC may revert to its old G-10 premises early next year, possibly in January, since litigants face difficulties entering the Red Zone to pursue their cases. The move would also ease logistical issues for lawyers who must shuttle between the district courts and the high court to file bail applications, appeals, etc.
There is also a possibility that a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) may be called soon to consider the confirmation of Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, who was elevated as an acting judge of the Supreme Court on Feb 14 this year.
The counsel also disclosed that during hearings in one FCC courtroom, a lawyer was told that the FCC should be their first priority and that they should appear before it before attending cases at the Supreme Court.
Cases’ hearing
On Monday, three different FCC benches heard cases. Bench-I comprised FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah. Bench-II included Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, while Bench-III consisted of Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech.
Meanwhile, Bench-I, while taking up a case relating to the change of status of an amenity plot, stayed the Aug 26, 2025 Sindh High Court judgement and issued notices to various respondents, adjourning further proceedings until Nov 27.
Declaring the matter a public-interest case, the FCC also directed the SHC not to proceed with a contempt of court case against the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which some respondents had moved before the high court.
The KMC, through its mayor, had challenged the SHC decision that declared void and illegal the corporation’s May 19 resolution allowing public-private partnership agreements under rental arrangements to initiate commercial activities on nine different amenity plots.
In the first round of litigation, the petitioners had questioned the conversion of nine Karachi amenity plots into sports grounds for commercial use, for which exorbitant usage fees were being charged.
The plots include Jheel Park, Hill Park, Umer Sharif Park, Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim, KMC Sports Complex, Hosh Muhammad Sheedi Park, St-4 Clifton Block 2, St-15 Clifton Block 1, and St-19 Clifton Block 1.
The petitioners argued that the SHC judgement was unwarranted in law and had created an administrative and executive vacuum. They contended that the verdict was based on presumptions and relied on precedents not applicable to the present issue. Most importantly, they argued, it failed to consider the contours of public purpose as presently relevant to ground realities.

The latest data issued by the State Bank on Monday showed that the country posted a CAD of $733 million in July-October compared with $206m in the same period last year. Another vital change was that October posted a $112m deficit, compared with a $83m surplus in September.
The pressure on the current account is directly related to higher imports, while the exports remained stagnant during the current fiscal year. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the government had relaxed import curbs.
The government is under severe criticism for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years, and financial circles believe it was a deliberate attempt to cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn in FY25, but economic growth remained at 2.6pc, which was later revised to 3pc.

Rising imports and falling exports contributed to poor performance

Experts have been advising the government to ease import restrictions to boost economic growth, as the country has an import-led growth model.
The data shows that imports of goods and services during the first four months of the current fiscal year rose to $24.919bn, up from $22.647bn in the same period last year. However, the export did not show any significant change as the total stood at $13.664bn during July-October compared to $13.041bn in the same period of FY25.
The trade deficit during the 4 months of the current fiscal year was $11.255bn compared to $9.606bn in the same period of FY25.
Despite the higher current account deficit, other external account indicators are supportive of the government. Remittances in October totalled $3.4bn, up from $3.2bn in the preceding month. Overall remittances, compared to last year, increased during the 4 months, which was against policymakers’ expectations. The government expects to receive $40bn remittances in FY26.
At the same time, the expected inflow of $1.2bn from the IMF under the EFF and RSF programmes, and support from the United States for investment, have changed sentiment towards Pakistan. Some analysts believe remittances will rise as a result of the defence pact with Saudi Arabia.
“The current account deficit is the key to the stability of the external account of the country and a basic need for higher foreign exchange reserves that stabilises the exchange rate,” said an analyst. He said that if the current account deficit persists in the first half of the fiscal FY26, it would be damaging to both the economy and the country.

This assessment is reinforced by recent reports from the world’s leading news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Al Jazeera, which indicate that one of Al Qaeda’s regional affiliates, Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), is on the verge of capturing the Malian capital, Bamako. 
Operating across the Sahel region of West Africa, primarily in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, JNIM is imposing an economic siege on the capital by blocking routes used by fuel tankers, effectively bringing the country to a standstill. 
Despite the elimination or arrest of its top to mid-ranking leadership in the Afghanistan-Pakistan (Af-Pak) region over the last two decades — through extensive US-led counter-terrorism operations across Af-Pak, the Middle East and Africa — Al Qaeda has persisted by adopting a key strategy: evolving from a hierarchical, centralised organisational structure to a decentralised network of franchises. 

More than two decades after 9/11, Al Qaeda hasn’t vanished — it’s adapted. As one of its regional affiliates brings Mali’s capital to a standstill and another, Al Shabaab, regains ground in Somalia, extremist networks are once again touting the establishment of Islamic emirates…

These franchises have been granted operational autonomy while adhering to Al Qaeda Central’s (AQC) general ideology. This strategic shift has enabled the group to maintain its influence and continue its operations, even in the face of significant leadership losses.
Apart from JNIM, Al Shabaab — another formidable Al-Qaeda affiliate — currently controls significant portions of southern and central Somalia, as of November 2025. The group has recently regained ground, reversing many of the territorial losses incurred during the Somali government’s 2022-2023 counter-offensive.
Recently, a number of encrypted extremist channels, known for sharing propaganda from the Az-Zallaqah Foundation — the official media and propaganda arm of JNIM — featured one common written commentary with a bold prediction. “It seems that before the end of this year, the jihadists will have an Islamic state or emirate, either in Mali, Somalia or both.”
THE EVOLUTION OF AFFILLIATES 
These developments are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a broader extremist context and trend. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has proven to be a key catalyst, ideologically inspiring and operationally emboldening extremist groups — including regional entities such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and global networks like Al Qaeda — to pursue territorial control.
Al Qaeda is now predominantly managed by its affiliates, while its central leadership remains largely restricted to issuing general directives. Following the assassination of its second top leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, the organisation has been unable to formally announce his successor. 
The first affiliate, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), was established in 2004, followed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2006-2007 in North Africa and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009. 
Al Shabaab, recognised as Al-Qaeda’s most affluent affiliate, with reported estimated annual revenue exceeding $100 million, emerged in 2012. Subsequently, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) was formed in September 2014, and JNIM, which includes AQIM and four Malian armed groups, was established in 2017. Additionally, Hurras al-Din (HAD) surfaced in Syria in early 2018.
Among the affiliates mentioned above, several have either gradually become completely defunct, merged with others, or dissolved. For instance, AQIM merged with JNIM, HAD was declared dissolved by Al-Qaeda, while AQI evolved into the Islamic State (IS). The split between Al Qaeda and the IS became official in February 2014, when Al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relationship with the IS. It came after months of tension between the two groups, sparked by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s refusal to follow directives from Al Qaeda’s central command led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, on ideological, operational and organisational matters.
The most intriguing case in our region is the Al Qaeda branch, AQIS, which was once responsible for nearly all significant attacks against key security installations throughout Pakistan, alongside the TTP. AQIS also played a crucial role in supporting the TTP in ideological, operational and propaganda efforts, but it is now primarily limited to disseminating propaganda content and is operationally inactive.
IMPACT OF THE DOHA PEACE AGREEMENT
Analysts maintain that AQC and AQIS have become the primary casualties of the US-Taliban Doha peace agreement in 2020, as a key condition of the deal is to prevent Al Qaeda from using Afghan soil to “threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” 
As a result of these bilateral arrangements, AQC is even unable to acknowledge the death of its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul in July 2022 or to announce his successor formally, while AQIS’s operations have completely disappeared.
The Doha Agreement created a paradox for Al Qaeda, explains Riccardo Valle, my colleague and head of research at The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform focusing on extremist groups and conflict. “It achieved their primary goal of empowering the Taliban in Afghanistan, but it also forced AQC and AQIS to adopt a low profile, to avoid provoking the Americans,” he continues. “This has led AQIS to redirect its focus to Pakistan, supporting the Pakistani Taliban’s campaign against the state, often under the guise of new alliances.”
A RESILIENT THREAT
Al Qaeda has modified its operational tactics and organisational structure, yet its core ideology remains intact. The group seems to be refraining from executing major attacks, especially in the West, to avoid repercussions and to allow its territorial expansion in East and West Africa to continue unhindered. 
This strategic patience distinguishes Al Qaeda from the Islamic State’s approach in 2014-2017, when the latter simultaneously pursued territorial control while conducting high-profile international attacks — a strategy that ultimately drew overwhelming military response and territorial collapse.
Reports suggest that the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), the intelligence service of the Afghan Taliban, has a dedicated section for managing foreign terrorist entities in Afghanistan, including Al Qaeda. These entities are allegedly provided with security, accommodations, a monthly stipend and, in certain cases, even nationalities. Tajmir Jawad, the deputy director of GDI, is reportedly responsible for overseeing these foreign groups, primarily Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan.
If one conducts even a basic investigation, a fundamental factor would emerge as the principal reason for the rise and growth of all these Al Qaeda affiliates within their respective countries: weak states struggling with issues such as foreign intervention, inadequate governance, political exclusion, ongoing conflicts, and economic disparities, all of which provide a conducive environment for militant organisations to thrive. 
With a robust ideological framework, these groups try to position themselves before the masses as an alternative to the current ruling class, which has not adequately addressed the people’s grievances over the years.
Although Al Qaeda’s central leadership may be weakened, its influence is expanding within the extremist landscape, as the territorial strength of its affiliates continues to grow across various regions, presenting a significant threat. These affiliates, which share strong ideological alignment with AQC but operate with a degree of autonomy, will furnish Al Qaeda’s core leadership with new avenues for funding, recruitment and operational bases, thereby allowing it to sustain a global presence. 
A significant development in recent years has been the international acceptance and de facto diplomatic recognition of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, along with the formal diplomatic recognition and warm reception of the Ahmed Al-Sharaa-led government in Syria on the world stage (Al-Sharaa was once a member of AQI and headed the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra front). This may have established a precedent for Al Qaeda, suggesting that, if it were to seize control of a country, it could seek the same recognition and acceptance from the international community. 
Such a scenario could prompt Al Qaeda to adopt a strategy that merges warfare with political manoeuvring to fulfil its objectives, rather than resorting to confrontation as it did after the 9/11 attacks.
