<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/271253127917124.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937565/imran-orders-pti-members-to-resign-from-all-na-standing-committees' target='_blank'><strong>Imran orders PTI members to resign from all NA standing committees</strong></a><br><p>The majority of PTI members are resigning from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the National Assembly on the instructions of party chairman Imran Khan, NA member Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel said on Wednesday.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots against Imran’s arrest, sparking protests in the NA.
The resignation announcement took place following a meeting of PTI’s political committee that ended at 3:30am this morning, according to Mastikhel.
The MNA today said that PTI members were resigning from memberships and chairmanships of all standing committees.
“PTI has resigned from the PAC (Public Accounts Committee) and other committees,” he said in a video announcement before the Public Accounts Committee meeting, adding that political matters would be handed over to the political committee for further consultation.
According to the opposition leader’s chamber, the decision on resignations had been made, and members, including Junaid Akbar, had written their resignations, but the resignations had not been formally submitted to the speaker as yet.
Confirming his move to Dawn.com, Akbar said there was no room nor desire for any other decision once Imran had ordered the resignations. “There is no use in remaining in the standing committees if there is no momentum towards further relief for Imran or his release.”
Meanwhile, Mastikhel added that the resignation from the committees was decided on the instructions of Imran after a meeting of four and a half hours, extending his thanks to the PTI founder for reposing his full trust in the political committee.
“As the decision was taken in the late hours of the night, today we also have a parliamentary party meeting … whatever Mr Khan orders, we will follow accordingly,” he said.
 
 

Mastikhel also added that the second decision made by the political committee was to field a candidate in the vacant seat of the late Mian Azhar’s constituency following his death.
The late Azhar’s son, Hammad Azhar, clarified in a post on X yesterday that the decision to boycott by-elections was due to the PTI members in those areas being “unjustly disqualified”, while the matter of Mian Azhar’s natural death was a different case, according to Imran.
“He (Imran) also said that due to the demise, someone from Mian Azhar’s family or a candidate nominated by Hammad Azhar will contest the election from here,” Hammad added.
 






Chairman Junaid Akbar did not attend the PAC meeting today, where the Cabinet Division, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) audit objections were under consideration. The meeting instead took place under the chairmanship of Naveed Qamar.
The Cabinet Division, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) audit objections are under consideration today.
The political committee expressed deep concern over the daily hearings related to the Toshakhana trial in Adiala Jail, saying they would “affect the fundamental rights of the accused” and create obstacles in the delivery of justice.
“The PTI considers the members disqualified in the May 9 cases as its true representatives,” the committee added, saying it would boycott by-elections being held in the constituencies of disqualified members.
According to the announcement, elections will be held in the NA-129 constituency of Lahore.
Earlier this month, members of the opposition party staged a vociferous protest in the NA against the continuing convictions of its leaders and subsequent disqualifications of its lawmakers.</p><small>2025-08-27 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/271646082138505.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937611/trump-again-claims-tariff-threats-ended-pakistan-india-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Trump again claims tariff threats ended Pakistan-India conflict</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump once again claimed credit on Tuesday for ending the conflict between India and Pakistan, saying that his threat of extremely high tariffs was instrumental in reaching a ceasefire agreement.
Participating in a cabinet meeting at the White House yesterday, the US president reiterated the claim that his intervention was directly responsible for the end of the conflict.
“India and Pakistan were gonna end up in a nuclear war if I didn’t stop them,” he said, adding, “I saw seven jets were shot down … $150 million planes were shot down; seven, maybe more than that, they didn’t even report the real number.”
Trump added that he had spoken to both India and Pakistan at the time of the conflict, asking them what was going on between them.
“The hatred was tremendous,” he said, saying that the conflict had been going on, “sometimes with different names”, for hundreds of years.
Without specifying whether he had been speaking to India or Pakistan, the president said that he had refused to make a trade deal if the two countries ended up in a nuclear war, which had proven pivotal.
 
 

“I said, ‘Call me back tomorrow, but we’re not gonna do any deals with you,’” Trump said, “‘Or … we’re gonna put tariffs on you so high, I don’t give a damn, your head’s gonna spin. You’re not gonna end up in a war.’ Within about five hours, it was done.”
Alluding to the possibility that the conflict could begin again, he said, “I don’t think so, but I’ll stop it if it does. We can’t let these things happen.”
 


Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between India and Pakistan, while also regularly threatening steep tariffs on countries that — including hiking tariffs on India to 50 per cent for continuing to buy Russian crude oil, a move that took effect today.
India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. India has publicly expressed frustration over what it sees as the Trump administration’s increasing tendency to insert itself into India-Pakistan affairs.
Pakistan, meanwhile, hailed the move, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praising Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region.</p><small>2025-08-27 12:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/271740190bfb66d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937625/indian-cabinet-approves-2030-commonwealth-games-bid-names-ahmedabad-as-ideal-host-city' target='_blank'><strong>Indian cabinet approves 2030 Commonwealth Games bid, names Ahmedabad as ‘ideal host city’</strong></a><br><p>India said on Wednesday that the city of Ahmedabad is an “ideal” location for the 2030 Commonwealth Games, with its bid viewed as part of a wider push by the cricket-mad nation to host the 2036 Olympics.
Ahmedabad is the key city in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, home to a 130,000-seater arena, the world’s biggest cricket stadium and named after the premier.
Modi’s cabinet approved India’s bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games on Wednesday.
India submitted a formal letter of intent last year to the International Olympic Committee to host the 2036 Games.
“Ahmedabad is an ideal host city offering world-class stadiums, cutting-edge training facilities, and a passionate sporting culture,” a cabinet statement read.
“Narendra Modi Stadium, the largest stadium in the world, has already demonstrated its capability by successfully hosting the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Final,” it said.
Nigeria and at least two other nations have reportedly expressed interest in hosting the Commonwealth Games, which struggled to find a replacement host for 2026 after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew, citing costs.
The British city of Glasgow stepped in and will stage a slimmed-down version.
The decision on the 2030 host will be made in November.
India said that if it wins the bid, the Commonwealth Games would be a “full-fledged” event.
That would include tag-type sports such as kabaddi and kho kho, which India is pushing to be included in the Olympics.
India has a population of 1.4 billion but its record at the Olympics is poor for a country of its size, winning only 10 gold medals in its history.</p><small>2025-08-27 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27172105c82c0e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937593/heavy-rains-hit-himalayas-spread-havoc-in-india-and-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rains hit Himalayas, spread havoc in India and Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Heavy rain swept across the Himalayas, killing at least 36 people in India over the past 24 hours and forcing authorities to open major dams, in turn triggering flood alerts on three rivers in neighbouring Pakistan.
In the deadliest single disaster, a landslide killed 33 people near the Hindu mountain shrine of Vaishno Devi on a pilgrim route in India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Three more people died as floodwaters burst the banks of rivers in the district of Doda and swamped low-lying areas, authorities added.

About 200 children were stranded on Wednesday after flood water engulfed a school building in the northern state of Punjab, local media said.
Vehicles tumbled off the Madhopur barrage over the Tawi river when parts of it collapsed after being lashed by heavy rain overnight into Wednesday morning, video images showed. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Some highways linking Indian-occupied Jammu to the rest of India were also damaged.
Officials were battling to restore “almost non-existent” telecommunications services, Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, said.
“We had 612mm rainfall in [Indian-occupied] Jammu region since August 23 till today. This is 726pc above-normal rainfall in the region during this time of the year. It is the highest rainfall in the region since 1950,” Mukhtar Ahmad, Director at the India Meteorological Department in Srinagar, told Reuters.

There were forecasts for more rain and thunderstorms with gusty winds in mountainous Ladakh, and for heavy rain for Himachal Pradesh and Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.
Some water had begun to recede on Wednesday, but many rivers were still at dangerous levels, authorities said.
“The immediate priority is restoration of electricity, water supply and mobile services, for which the authorities have been working continuously overnight,” Jitendra Singh, India’s science and technology minister, said in a post on X.
 






Dams open
Over the border, flood water engulfed parts of Kartarpur Sahib, a famous Sikh temple in Pakistan’s Punjab, a rescue official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan has also battled monsoon rains in recent weeks, with more than 167,000 people displaced in Punjab, including 40,000 who left voluntarily after flood warnings since August 14.
The official death toll from Pakistan’s floods since the start of the monsoon season in late June stood at 804 on Wednesday, half of them in August.
India opened the gates of major dams on rivers in Indian-occupied Kashmir after the heavy rains, an Indian government source said.
Pakistan said it had received a warning from India about downstream flooding, and issued its own alert for three rivers flowing into its territory. India routinely releases water from its dams when they get too full, with the excess flowing into Pakistan.

Today, authorities said there had been a record increase in the levels of the Ravi, Chenab and Sutlej rivers in Pakistan.
Pakistan says New Delhi had passed on two earlier flood warnings since Sunday.

A punitive 25pc tariff imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil adds to Trump’s prior 25pc tariff on many products from India. It takes total duties to as high as 50pc for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals — among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China.
The new tariffs threaten thousands of small exporters and jobs, including in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat.
India’s Commerce Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, a Commerce Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East.
A US Customs and Border Protection notice to shippers provides a three-week exemption for Indian goods that were loaded onto a vessel and in transit to the US before the midnight deadline.
These goods can still enter the US at prior lower tariff rates before 12:01am EDT (09:01 PKT) on September 17.
 
 

Also exempted are steel, aluminium and derivative products, passenger vehicles, copper and other goods subject to separate tariffs of up to 50pc under the Section 232 national security trade law.
India trade ministry officials say the average tariff on US imports is around 7.5pc, while the US Trade Representative’s office has highlighted rates of up to 100pc on autos and an average applied tariff rate of 39pc on US farm goods.
Failed talks
As the midnight activation deadline approached, US officials offered no hope for India to avert the tariffs.
“Yeah,” said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro when asked if the increased tariffs on India’s US-bound exports would go into effect as previously announced on Wednesday. He offered no further details.
Wednesday’s tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that US tariffs could be capped at 15pc, the rate granted to goods from some other major US trade partners, including Japan, South Korea and the European Union.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgment and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies. Their two-way goods trade totalled $129 billion in 2024, with a $45.8bn US trade deficit, according to US Census Bureau data.
Exporters lose competitive edge
Exporter groups estimate hikes could affect nearly 55pc of India’s $87bn in merchandise exports to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China.
“The move will disrupt Indian exports to the largest export market,” said S C Ralhan, president of Federation of Indian Export Organisations, noting about 55pc of exports, including textiles, chemicals and leather, will face a 30-35pc price disadvantage against competitors.
The government should consider a one-year moratorium on bank loans for affected exporters, besides extending low-cost credit and easier availability of loans, he said.
Rajeswari Sengupta, an economics professor at Mumbai’s Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said allowing the rupee to “depreciate is one way to provide indirect support to the exporters” and regain lost competitiveness.
Sustained tariffs at this rate could dent India’s growing appeal as an alternative manufacturing hub to China for goods such as smartphones and electronics.
The US-India standoff has raised questions about the broader relationship between India and the US, important security partners who share concerns about China.
However, on Tuesday, the US State Department and India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued identical statements saying senior officials of the ministries and defence departments met virtually on Monday and expressed “eagerness to continue enhancing the breadth and depth of the bilateral relationship.”
Both sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the Quad, a partnership that brings together the US and India with Australia and Japan.</p><small>2025-08-27 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2714563090f891e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937575/gwadar-port-to-be-powered-via-solar-energy-in-bid-to-enhance-efficiency-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Gwadar port to be powered via solar energy in bid to enhance efficiency: minister</strong></a><br><p>Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday announced that plans are underway to utilise solar energy to power Balochistan’s Gwadar port in a bid to improve its efficiency, a press release issued by his ministry said.
Gwadar Port, built more than a decade ago, still remains a non-starter, prompting the federal government to speed up efforts aimed at the maximum utilisation of the port. Earlier this month, Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) and a Chinese company agreed to boost investments at the port, in an attempt to develop it as a “regional transhipment centre”.
In a meeting aimed at enhancing the port’s operations, Chaudhry announced that “efforts are underway to implement solar-based solutions” to enhance the operational capability of the Gwadar port.
In that regard, a sub-committee has been established, which will be responsible for planning and implementing an “efficient solar panel utilisation plan, recommending the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, battery storage solutions for Gwadar’s water facilities, and proposing measures to enhance the region’s power supply,” the press release said.
Further outlining the responsibilities of the sub-committee, it added: “ The committee will design solar power distribution systems integrated with storage options to ensure a dependable energy supply for critical infrastructure, including the Gwadar Port Authority.“
The sub-committee will include representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Federal Board of Revenue, Gwadar Port Authority, Gwadar Development Authority, Quetta Electric Supply Company, and officials from the Prime Minister’s office.
According to Chaudhry, the plan will establish micro solar grids across the port, which is expected to meet the energy demands of the port throughout the year.
“The initiative seeks to significantly reduce Gwadar’s reliance on external energy by making it self-sufficient through local power sources,” the press release quoted him as saying.
He also detailed that the grids will be “set up at strategic locations to supply power for water pumps and the 1.2 million gallons per day (MGD) desalination plant.”
Chaudhry said the initiative will be fully functional soon, which will in turn facilitate the “establishment of new factories in the Gwadar free zone and provide power to the Gwadar International Airport.”
The minister shared that the maritime ministry is working in collaboration with the planning ministry, along with other relevant bodies, to resolve Gwadar’s “power and water scarcity” problems.
He highlighted that a shift to solar power could also potentially save Gwadar’s fishing industry over a million dollars.
“Solar energy is not only a matter of reducing expenses but also vital to protecting the city’s flagship industry, which supports local livelihoods and strengthens its position in export markets,” the press release quoted him as saying.
In attendance at the meeting were: Chairman Gwadar Port Authority Noorul Haque Baloch, Chairman COPHCL My Yu Bo, Additional Secretary Maritime Ministry Umer Zaffer Shaikh, and Technical Advisor Jawad Akhtar.
On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced a plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
In January, the government sought private sector support in routing its cargoes through Gwadar Port.</p><small>2025-08-27 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/271446588abbbf9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937574/indian-spin-great-ashwin-calls-time-on-ipl-career' target='_blank'><strong>Indian spin great Ashwin calls time on IPL career</strong></a><br><p>Indian spin great Ravichandran Ashwin on Wednesday announced his retirement from the Indian Premier League and plans to play in other global franchise tournaments.
The 38-year-old, a master off-spinner who quit international cricket in December during India’s Test tour of Australia, ends as the fifth-highest wicket-taker in the IPL with 187 scalps.
He played for five IPL franchises and won the tournament with Chennai Super Kings in 2010 and 2011, where he also played in this year’s edition.
“They say every ending will have a new start,” Ashwin wrote on social media.
“My time as an IPL cricketer comes to a close today but my time as an explorer of the game around various leagues begins today.”
 






The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) does not allow any current player in Indian international or domestic cricket to feature in overseas leagues.
The feisty Ashwin finished his India career with 537 wickets in 106 Tests at an average of 24.00.
He also played 116 one-day and 65 T20 internationals.</p><small>2025-08-27 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27120704519d3f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937554/pakistans-monsoon-misery-natures-fury-mans-mistake' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s monsoon misery: Nature’s fury, man’s mistake</strong></a><br><p>Floodwaters gushing through mountain villages, cities rendered swamps, mourners gathered at fresh graves — as Pakistan’s monsoon season once again delivers scenes of calamity, it also lays bare woeful preparedness.
Without better regulation of construction and sewer maintenance, the annual downpours that have left hundreds dead in recent months will continue to kill, experts say.
Even Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appeared to agree as he toured flood-stricken Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province last week, where landslides killed more than 450 people.
“Natural disasters are acts of God, but we cannot ignore the human blunders,” he said.
“If we keep letting influence-peddling and corruption control building permits, neither the people nor the governments will be forgiven.”
Pakistan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with limited resources for adaptation.
In the devastated mountain villages the prime minister visited, and beyond, residential areas are erected near riverbeds, blocking “natural storm drains,” former climate change minister Sherry Rehman told AFP.
Entrepreneur Fazal Khan now recognises the “mistake” of building too close to the river.
His home in the Swat Valley was destroyed first by 2010 floods and then again in the 2022 inundation that affected nearly four million Pakistanis.
“On August 15, once again, the floodwater surged through the channel and entered our home,” the 43-year-old father said.

Man-made mistakes
Since it began in June, this year’s monsoon has killed around 800 people and damaged more than 7,000 homes, with further downpours expected through September.
While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, unpredictable and deadly across the region.
By the middle of this month, Pakistan had already received 50 per cent more rainfall than this time last year, according to disaster authorities, while in neighbouring India, flash floods and sudden storms have killed hundreds.
Extractive practices have also compounded the climate-related disasters, with cash-strapped but mineral-rich Pakistan eager to meet growing American and Chinese demand.
Rehman, the former minister, said mining and logging have altered the natural watershed.
“When a flood comes down, especially in mountainous terrain, a dense forest is very often able to check the speed, scale and ferocity of the water, but Pakistan now only has 5pc forest coverage, the lowest in South Asia,” she said.
Urban infrastructure, too, has faltered.
Days after villages were swept away in the north, a spell of rain in the south brought Pakistan’s financial capital, Karachi, to a standstill.
The coastal megacity — home to more than 20 million people — recorded 10 deaths last week, with victims electrocuted or crushed by collapsing roofs.
A Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) report said brown water inundating streets is not only the result of rain but “clogged drains, inadequate solid waste disposal, poor infrastructure, encroachments, elitist housing societies… and so on.”
Published in the wake of 2020’s deadly floods, the report still rings true today.

‘Negligence’
According to the commission, the problems are “inherently political” as various parties use building permits to fuel their patronage networks — often disregarding the risks of constructing on top of drainage canals.
In some areas, “the drain has become so narrow that when high tide occurs and it rains simultaneously, instead of the water flowing into the sea, it flows back into the river,” urban planning expert Arif Hasan said in an interview after the 2022 floods.
In the sprawling, rapidly swelling city, the various authorities, both civil and military, have failed to coordinate urban planning, according to the rights commission.
As a result, what infrastructure does get built can solve one problem while creating others.
“Karachi isn’t being destroyed by rain, but by years of negligence,” said Taha Ahmed Khan, an opposition lawmaker in the Sindh provincial assembly.
“Illegal construction and encroachments on stormwater drains, along with substandard roads… have only worsened the crisis,” he added.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab says he has been asking Islamabad every year for help financing the revamping of drainage canals, to no avail.
“It’s easy to suggest that drainage capacity should be enhanced, but the cost is so high that it might require spending almost the entire national budget,” he told AFP.

Yet during June’s budget vote, the opposition accused the city of having spent only 10pc of funds earmarked for a massive development project.
The five-year plan, designed with international donors, was supposed to end the city’s monsoon suffering by the end of 2024.
But nearly a year later, there is no respite.

First introduced in the United States this year, the feature is now expanding globally, with Pakistan among the latest countries to gain access.
The tool, powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5, enables people to ask longer and more complex questions that previously required multiple searches. Available in English, AI Mode can be accessed via the Google app on Android and iOS, as well as on mobile and desktop web.
In a statement, Google said that early testers have shown that queries are already two to three times longer than traditional searches, highlighting the tool’s usefulness for exploratory tasks such as comparing products, planning trips, or tackling “how-to” questions.
“It dives deep to answer multiple questions at once, with helpful links for further exploration,” the company said.
Google explained that Pakistani users can use ‘AI Mode’ for different use cases, including “Planning a trip” by writing a prompt about a trip to any place at a particular time and seeking suggestions from the AI mode for a five-day itinerary that balances sightseeing, adventure and local food experiences, with a follow-up prompt: “Can you recommend some local food spots or traditional dishes in that particular area?”
At the same time, the other prompts could be related to the education of children, such as the example of a child in grade 9 struggling with math. “Can you suggest free online resources in Pakistan to help with algebra and geometry?” and the follow-up prompt like “Can you recommend interactive apps or YouTube channels for grade 9 math practice?”
 
 

Behind the scenes, AI Mode uses a “query fan-out” technique, breaking down a user’s question into subtopics and running multiple searches simultaneously.
This approach allows Google to surface highly relevant content from across the web, combining it with information from the Knowledge Graph and real-time shopping data for billions of products.
The feature is also multimodal, allowing users to interact through text, voice or images. For example, a photo of unfamiliar spices at a local market could be uploaded with the question: “What are these spices and how can I use them in Pakistani cooking?” Follow-up questions can then be asked in a conversational style, creating a seamless browsing experience.
Google said AI Mode is designed to deliver deeper, smarter and more comprehensive results, but acknowledged that, as with any early-stage AI system, responses may not always be accurate.

He needed it for his next fastball to Akram, who stood poised to bat — right in the middle of the trash. “We’re used to playing here,” Salman shrugged. “We wash our hands with regular water.” Like many children in the area, he had no idea how hazardous the dumping ground could be to his health.
“It’s been five months, and there’s been no action from the authorities,“ lamented Jameel Langove, who runs a flour mill nearby. “The dumping ground has become a haven for drug addicts and immoral activities. It’s affecting our neighbourhood and our children.” He recounted how a recent storm had blown heaps of garbage into nearby homes. Living so close to the site, residents, particularly the elderly, now struggle with asthma and other breathing problems caused by dust and waste polluting the air.
Quetta, once fondly referred to as “Little London”, is buckling under a range of urban pressures: irregular development, an inadequate sewerage system, traffic congestion in the city centre, overflowing manholes, a shortage of clean drinking water, unmanaged dumping sites, unregulated crush plants, sewage water used for cultivation, a lack of green spaces and playgrounds, and narrow, clogged inner roads.

“Rapid expansion beyond the city’s original design — initially planned for around 100,000 residents — has resulted in a population exceeding 1 million. However, many of the master planning guidelines remain unimplemented,” lamented Sanaullah Panezai, an Associate Professor at the Department of Geography and Regional Planning at Balochistan University.
At the same time, Quetta faces acute vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards: floods, earthquakes, landslides, and urban disasters amplify planning failures. Panezai added that in 2022, floods caused significant damage to the city’s physical and water infrastructure.
To top it off, the city generates around 1,600 tonnes of garbage every day, yet only 400 tonnes are collected due to a severe funding shortfall. The city receives Rs1 billion for waste management — far below the Rs4 billion required.
Amid all this, Quetta’s bazaars, once bustling with colour and life, now lie under a pall of dust and decay. Areas such as Liaqat Bazaar, Prince Road, Gowrgath Singh Road, Sirki Road, Masjid Road, Jinnah Road, Kawari Road, Hazara Town, Marri Abad, Nawa Kili, Pashtoon Abad, and Sariab, along with the Western and Eastern Bypass roads, bear the marks of neglect.
If you ask the authorities, though, they will tell you all is well, coupled with promises laced in bureaucratic jargon of big projects and development.
Rafiq Baloch, Quetta development project director, told Dawn.com that 15 projects had been launched in recent years, 10 of which are now complete. These include the construction of 97 kilometres of internal streets in the Sariab area. Five more projects are currently in progress, he said, with roads being built alongside sewage systems to ensure proper water drainage. He also noted that six sports complexes have been completed across the city.

Inside the city’s failing sewage system
And yet, none of this explains the state of the city. In recent years, for instance, the open sewage system at the intersection of Jan Muhammad Road and Kawari Road, right next to Quetta’s Children’s Hospital, has become a major public health and urban management concern, affecting residents, local businesses, commuters, and, most critically, the hospital’s young patients.
Jaffar Khan, a resident who lives nearby, frequently visits the hospital with his wife after the recent birth of their baby. The newborn has been suffering from diarrhoea. “We avoid taking a rickshaw to the hospital because the open sewage causes traffic jams,” Jaffar explained. “Instead, we walk — since it’s close by — but we worry that the filthy water, which has been stagnant here for months, could expose our child to new diseases.”
On Kawari Road, shopkeeper Asmat Ullah points to a gaping five-foot-wide sewage drain outside his furniture store. Many women, motorcyclists, and rickshaw drivers, he says, have fallen into it. “It’s also hurting our business,” he added, “because customers avoid coming here due to the stench and the mosquitoes breeding in the sewage.” Instead of easing sanitation issues, the three sewage lines running along the road have become a persistent public nuisance.
Quetta’s main Civil Hospital lies just a short walk from the Red Zone and the Commissioner’s Office, yet the footpaths around it, particularly on three corners, are dotted with open drains, potholes, and encroaching vendor stalls, making them dangerous and unusable for pedestrians. Similarly, a deep, uncovered sewage channel in front of Balochistan University reflects the city’s crumbling urban infrastructure, even within its key institutions.

“Sewage infrastructure in Quetta is in a deplorable condition, primarily due to poor design,” acknowledged Dr Faisal Ahmed Khan, Chief Executive Officer of Balochistan’s public-private partnership authority. The authority also oversees the Safa Quetta project, responsible for maintaining the city’s cleanliness and managing its waste.
He identified weak sewage infrastructure — compounded by the widespread use of plastic bags — as the main cause of blocked drains across the city. Despite these shortcomings, Dr Khan noted that the waste management contractor has performed relatively well in drain desilting and sewage maintenance, citing the limited number of drain overflows during Quetta’s recent two rain spells.
“The services may not be impeccable, but given the challenging ground realities and civic behaviour, the sewage system has been maintained reasonably well,” he said. “In the downtown area, about 128 dump points have been eliminated.”
Dr Khan interestingly also pointed out that several dumping sites, near Killi Ismail, Jinnah Town, Shehbaz Town, and certain stretches of Zarghoon Road and Jinnah Road, do not fall under Quetta’s municipal jurisdiction but within the control of the cantonment board.
Solid waste disposal in the river
City nullah, originating in the cantonment area, winds through several key parts of Quetta including Sumangali Road, Kharotabad, Brewery Road near Bolan Medical Complex, and along Kirani Road before merging with Sariab Road. Instead of fulfilling its natural role, the waterway has become a major dumping ground for both solid and liquid waste.
Along Sumangali Road, the nullah flows past critical institutions, including the Cenar Cancer Hospital Quetta (the only cancer hospital in Balochistan), multiple schools, mosques, residential areas, an old age home, markets, and even the office of the environment department. Yet, it no longer resembles a river; its banks now function as an open landfill.

“This might be called a posh area, but look around — the conditions are horrible,” lamented Asif Ali, a long-time resident of Lehri Gate. “Women, children, the elderly, students, even patients heading to nearby hospitals are at risk. The filth, the smell — this isn’t what you expect in a neighbourhood like this.”
On the brink of a water crisis
Even as sewage lines and gutters overflow in the provincial capital, the water table has fallen at an alarming rate — from 300 feet in 2010 to 600 feet by 2021 — an average annual drop of 30 feet. Since no official groundwater survey has been conducted since 2021, current data remains unavailable, fuelling concerns that depletion may be continuing or even accelerating.
Over the years, the city’s drinking water shortage has become increasingly acute. “The water supply services are neither adequate nor safe for drinking and do not meet our basic needs. That’s why we have to arrange water tankers ourselves,” said Danish Mengal, a resident of Huda Road.
“The city’s demand is 61 million gallons per day, while it can barely supply 35 million gallons per day,” noted Panezai. “Over 500 tube wells are extracting water, primarily for drinking purposes. Due to over-extraction and disrupted natural recharge, groundwater levels have dropped below 360 metres.”
Large parts of the city, including Kirani Road, sections of Qambrani Road, Bashir Chowk, and Satellite Town, face severe shortages. Nimat Mazhar, a resident and council member affiliated with the Balochistan National Party-M said, “We have around 15 to 20 private tube wells in the area. Initially, private connections from these wells cost between Rs40,000 and Rs50,000. But after intervention from the local administration and community, the cost has dropped to around Rs2,000 per connection.”
 

In Jinnah Town, limited access to clean water compels residents to depend on unsafe sources

Mazhar added that in Hazara Town, water supply and pricing remain entirely unregulated and at the mercy of so-called water mafias. “In summer, they create more problems by cutting off supply, claiming electricity disconnection due to unpaid bills. This forces people to buy water from tankers, which can cost anywhere from Rs4,000 to Rs8,000, depending entirely on what they decide.”
The government had initially planned to supply water to the provincial capital via the Kachhi Canal, but later shifted focus to building dams for long-term sustainability. Under this initiative, work began on the Mangi Dam in 2017. In the 2023–24 financial year, Rs861 million were spent on the project, with an additional Rs1,000 million allocated for 2025–26.
Budget documents show that despite mounting concerns over water resources, the provincial government also allocated millions to new tube well projects in Quetta. Meanwhile, during a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting last year, chaired by Asghar Khan Tareen, serious concerns were raised over delays and escalating costs at the Mangi Dam. The meeting revealed that, despite Rs18 billion having been spent already, the dam remains incomplete.
A bumpy road ahead
At the southern entrance to Quetta, where the Greenbelt of Balochistan connects Karachi and Sindh to the city via Gahi Khan Chowk, a bridge has stood incomplete for several months. This stalled construction is not only generating dust and pollution for nearby shopkeepers but also causing severe traffic disruptions at one of the city’s most critical junctions.
Gul Mir Khan, who runs a pakora shop near the unfinished bridge, voiced his frustration. “We’re losing customers because of this,” he said. “The dust is causing breathing problems, and when it rains, the whole area turns into a river.”

According to Khan, several neighbouring shops have already closed due to the harsh conditions. Riaz Lehri, a local transporter operating nearby, echoed the frustration: “Every day, we get stuck here for nearly two hours,” he said, adding that the bridge has been incomplete for two years and that current construction activity feels more symbolic than substantive.
“Quetta lacks a mass transit system; roads are narrow and congested. Traffic worsens due to poor planning. The Green Bus Service is a good initiative; however, it does not meet the city’s needs for daily commuting and mass transport,” noted associate professor Panezai, responding to a question about Quetta’s roads and public transportation.
Elsewhere, road infrastructure remains in poor shape. Karani Road, the main approach to Hazara Town, is plagued with potholes, according to resident Nimat Mazhar. On Samungli Road, already impacted by the nearby city nullah drainage, road extension work has been delayed. For his part, Quetta Development Project Director Rafiq Baloch said the project is now expected to be completed within the next two months.
Has the city lost its glory?
Quetta, a valley where snow once fell, cool winds swept through, and majestic peaks — Chiltan, Takatu, Zarghoon, and Koh-i-Murdar — stood guard, has now transformed into a city of concrete. The thriving greenery that once fringed its outskirts has been steadily erased by urban development. Government neglect, poor civic planning, and limited public awareness have left the city short of green spaces, cinemas and theatres, public toilets, and freshwater canals.
“Sariab Road was once lined with trees and lush green plants on both sides. Sometimes, we travelled on the rooftop of the college bus just to feel the freshness of the air,” recalled Naseem Javeed, a resident of Marriabad Road, reminiscing his student life. “We often visited our Baloch friends in Kachi Bagh to enjoy fresh fruits and lassi,” he added, remembering the city’s inclusivity and charm. Once, the trees near the Red Zone echoed with the songs of hoopoes, mynas, nightingales, quails, and sparrows. Now, Javeed said, the air is thick with the noise and pollution of traffic.
 

Open drainage outside the children’s hospital poses health risks and causes traffic disruptions

In Marriabad, the same city nullah appears clean and well-maintained, thanks to the Hazara community’s habit of avoiding waste dumping and taking responsibility for its upkeep. This sense of civic responsibility contrasts sharply with other parts of Quetta, where garbage piles up amid official negligence and public apathy.
“The nullah used to be well maintained; its brick lining was clean, and sewage water flowed smoothly without obstruction,” said Captain Mubarak Ali Hazara. “Sadly, the city has lost much of its colonial-era architecture, which once contributed to its charm.” He lamented that although the city’s administration and political leadership are now local and not colonial, they still fail to take ownership.
When asked about civic behaviour in Quetta, Dr Faisal Ahmed Khan said it is “as poor as elsewhere in Pakistan.” Despite hundreds of waste bins placed across the city, litter often collects around them, and bin wheels are stolen within a week. Sanitation workers have even been attacked, and attempts to collect household service fees are often rejected.
In the face of these challenges, the city crumbles under the weight of its own waste, buried deeper by apathy both on the part of its administrators as well as its citizens.

According to sources, the matter came under detailed discussion at the recent meeting of the Board of Governors (BoG), which lasted nearly three hours, Dawn has learnt.
PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi also attended the session for about 15 to 20 minutes. During the meeting, various departments of the PCB including International Cricket, High Performance Cen­tre, Legal Affairs and Women’s Cricket presented their reports to the BoG.
The members, sources said, voiced dissatisfaction over the performance of the men’s senior team, women’s team and Pakistan Shaheens, questioning the International Cricket department over the ongoing slump.
The department, in its response, pointed to the instability at the top level, noting that the board has worked under four chairmen in less than three years — from Ramiz Raja (2021-23) to Najam Sethi and Zaka Ashraf (both with six-month tenures in 2023-24) and now Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024. With each chairman bringing wholesale changes, captains, selectors and coaches have been reshuffled repeatedly, creating further uncertainty.
The department also highlighted that in 2021 the PCB had restricted bilateral Test series to just two matches. However, from the next ICC cycle beginning in 2027, the board has decided to revert to full home-and-away series comprising at least three Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals.
While acknowledging the financial cost of this approach, officials said it was necessary to improve performance standards.
Another factor cited was the closure of the National Cricket Academy in recent years, which, according to the Inter­national department, adversely affected player development. The board has now decided that Pakistan Shaheens will regularly play series against major opponents, often alongside the senior team.
The High Performance Centre recommended that long-term appointments be made for captains, coaches and selectors to ensure continuity. It assured BoG members that all domestic academies would soon be fully operational, with positive results expected within a year. While offering to provide input on appointments, HPC officials stressed that the final decisions rested with the PCB chairman.

Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) Chief Exec­utive Officer Babir Sahib Din told Dawn that all residential and commercial property owners in Lahore’s upscale localities, including Gulberg, Johar Town, Muslim Town, New Mus­lim Town, Shadman, Faisal Town, Garden Town, Upper Mall Scheme, and the localities facing the Canal Road, Mall Road, and Jail Road will receive their bills next month.
Private housing schemes are exempt, however, because they have their own disposal system. “This was in the works for long and finally the government decided to impose a clea­n­liness fee in a bid to ensure excellent cleanliness in all area­s, starting from the posh ones in the first phase,” he revealed.
Penalty
The proposal to introduce a cleanliness fee regime had been approved by the Punjab cabinet in a meeting held a few months ago after the launch of the Suthra Punjab Progra­mme. However, its implementation across the province may take up to two months.

Defaulters to face hefty fines, even FIRs for littering

An LWMC spokesperson said that those people who failed to pay their bills will have their waste disposal service cancelled after two months. Besides, they could face hefty fines and FIRs if they were found dumping their waste illegally, he said.
Fee categories
Under this regime, Rs300 per month fee has been fixed for a five-marla house, Rs500 for up to 10-marla, Rs1,000 fee for the houses measuring one kanal and above.
Likewise, Rs500 to Rs3,000 cleanliness fee has been fixed for business premises according to nature and volume of the business. Rs200 fee has been suggested for houses in rural areas.
Mr Din said people in the posh localities of other districts, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, and Sargo­dha, would also receive cleanliness bills for August in the coming days.
He said these neighbourhoods would be declared ‘zero-waste’ areas, so the government would impose fines in case anyone was found littering.
“Our enforcement inspectors and their staff will start making rounds of these localities very soon. And if they found anyone littering, a fine would immediately be imposed on such people,” he warned, requesting the people to refrain from such acts.
He said the core objective behind the introduction of the cleanliness regime was not only to make the waste management system sustainable but also to create a sense of ownership among the public at large.

Weather officials forecast more rain and thunderstorms with gusty winds for the mountainous region of Ladakh, while heavy rain is set to lash the occupied Jammu and Kashmir territory.
Authorities were battling to restore telecom services as communication was “almost nonexistent”, said Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
Tuesday’s landslide near the shrine of Vaishno Devi on the pilgrims’ route killed at least 30 people, said ANI, in which Reuters holds a minor stake.
It was the latest havoc from downpours in the Himalayan region that killed 60 people, with 200 missing in Kishtwar in occupied Kashmir last week.
Authorities also ordered the closure of educational institutions in held Jammu, which weather officials said was deluged with 368 millimetres of rain on Tuesday.
The rivers Tawi, Chenab, and Basantar overflowed beyond their alert levels, causing floods in low-lying areas, held Jammu district official Rakesh Kumar told reporters.
Television images showed vehicles falling into a big hole after a bridge collapsed on the Tawi river, while some highways linking occupied Jammu to the rest of India were also damaged.
Pakistan has also grappled with monsoon rains in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, Islamabad said Punjab faced a “very high to exceptionally high” danger of flooding from a combination of heavy rains and India’s decision to release water from two dams.
The number of displaced in the province now exceeds 150,000, including nearly 35,000 who left voluntarily after flood warnings triggered by heavy rain since August 14, officials said.</p><small>2025-08-27 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27105036f9bc2de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937550/swiatek-sinner-cruise-as-expanded-us-open-serves-up-tennis-feast' target='_blank'><strong>Swiatek, Sinner cruise as expanded US Open serves up tennis feast</strong></a><br><p>Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner showed their championship pedigree at the US Open on Tuesday with commanding displays at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, walloping their first-round opponents on the third day of first-round action at the newly expanded major.

Top-ranked defending men’s champion Sinner followed suit with an equally dominant performance, swatting aside Czech Vit Kopriva 6-1 6-1 6-2.
 






The Italian, who had entered last year’s tournament under the dark cloud of a doping controversy after escaping a ban despite failing two drug tests, enjoyed strong crowd support as he set up a second-round meeting with Australian Alexei Popyrin.
With both day matches wrapping up in well under three hours, organisers moved 21st seed Linda Noskova’s clash with Hungary’s Dalma Galfi to the main stadium, where the Czech prevailed 6-4 7-5.

Coco Gauff had a tougher time, needing three sets to overcome Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4 6-7(2) 7-5 in the evening session on Ashe after dropping her opening service game and hitting consecutive double faults while serving at 5-4 in the decider.
The American, who recently split with mentor Matt Daly and hired biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan to address service issues, remained philosophical about her ongoing struggles.
 






“Honestly, it’s been really tough,” she said. “One of the days was mentally exhausting, but I’m trying. I mean, (my serve) wasn’t the best today, but … it came in when it mattered.
“It’s an improvement from last week. I’m just trying to improve with each match.”
Next up for Gauff is Paris Olympics silver medallist Donna Vekic.

They also stressed the need to prioritise regular cleaning of storm water drains and rainwater harvesting in ways that help replenish depleting groundwater resources and minimise the threat of urban flooding.
“There is a high risk for the spread of vector and water-borne diseases this year, given the high intensity of rains we have just experienced. We must try to utilise the brief time available right now before the next spell hits as pools of standing water will soon turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes,” shared Dr Imran Sarwar, who heads the emergency department of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
He added that generally cases of gastroenteritis, malaria and dengue see a sharp increase soon after the rains, especially during this season.

Overflowing gutters, pools of standing water, heaps of garbage fast becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes, experts warn

At the moment, Dr Sarwar pointed out, most patients reporting at the emergency department suffered from viral infections. “But, this pattern is likely to change in the coming days, as happens every year during and after the monsoon.”
Sharing his clinical observations, Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, Medical Superintendent at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre, said the vector and water-borne diseases constituted 30 to 40 percent of the patient load.
 
 

“The threat of water and vector-borne diseases must not be taken lightly as these diseases can kill, if complications occur. All age-groups are affected,” he said, adding that the city’s infrastructure was fragile and citizens shared the responsibility with the state to contribute towards making their neighborhoods livable.
Killing mosquitoes
Talking of solutions, Dr Waqar Ahmed at Karachi University’s Institute of Environmental Studies said that a small amount of oil, such as vegetable, neem or mineral or kerosene oil, added to the water where mosquitoes breed could kill these insects.
“This is an old traditional method. Unfortunately, most people have forgotten it. If citizens start doing so, there will be a sharp decline in mosquito population and cases of illnesses the insects cause,” he said, adding that the method didn’t cause any harm to the environment because the oil used was in too small a quantity.
Dr Ahmed also suggested that rainwater could also be used to replenish underground water resources with rain.
“If we could collect rainwater on the roofs and then direct it into boring channels going inside the ground, we could help recharge our reservoirs,” he explained, regretting that growing concretisation of the city had left limited unpaved spaces for replenishment of underground water.
The city authorities, he stressed, should also think and plan for rainwater harvesting, and make it mandatory on new buildings to have this mechanism.
“This will also help minimise urban flooding. The other strategy is ensuring regular cleaning of storm water drains and removing encroachments over them,” he said.

Addressing the launch ce­­remony, the prime minister said the new policy repres­e­nts a national commitment to reducing emissions, promoting clean technology, and shifting to sustainable transport solutions. He appl­auded the efforts of his ind­ustries aide Haroon Akhtar Khan and Federal Minister Rana Tanvir Hussain for crafting what he termed “a comprehensive and forward-looking framework”.
“I was personally involved in the meetings and I sincerely appreciate the dedication shown by Haroon Akh­tar, the secretary for industries, and all the relevant institutions, both at the federal and provincial levels,” the PM said. He also ack­no­wledged the technical support extended by the British government and the UK High Commissioner in shaping the policy framework.
PM Shehbaz and federal ministers also distributed e-scooters to a group of top-performing students. The students had scored the highest marks in various disciplines at the intermediate level.
 







Premier says framework also about empowering youth, reducing carbon footprint

He reiterated the distribution was strictly merit-based, with a 10pc additional quota for students from Balochis­tan. He also announced that 100,000 laptops would soon be distributed among high achievers, and proposed expanding the budget from Rs9 billion to Rs90 billion in the next fiscal year.
 
 

“This policy is not only ab­­out clean energy. It is about empowering our youth, re­­ducing our carbon footprint, and opening the door to a new era of innovation and opportunity,” he said about the NEV.
In his remarks, PM’s Spe­cial Assistant for Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan described the NEV Policy 2025-30 as “not just a statement of intent, but a blueprint for Pakistan’s clean transport revolution”. He emphasised that the policy was part of a larger national strategy to cut fuel imports, drive innovation, and empower youth.
“Pakistan spends billions annually on petroleum im­­ports, while urban air pollution costs us over Rs105 billion in healthcare and productivity losses. We are moving beyond vehicle assembly to battery production, charging infrastructu­­­re, and advanced parts manufacturing,” Mr Akhtar said.
Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanvir Hussain, who initially launched the policy initiative during his previous tenure as minister for industries, reflected with pride on its journey to final implementation.

PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan questioned how a country facing economic hardships could afford such packages.
“Is the board free to fix salaries at its own discret­i­­on without seeking appro­­v­­al from anyone?” he asked.
The chairman directed the finance division to provide details of the matter in the next meeting, to be held today (Wednesday), along with a list of how many other chairmen in various institutions were drawing salaries in the hundreds of millions.
The PAC also reviewed an audit objection regarding the non-recovery of Rs1.66 billion from the Karachi Country Club.
 
 

Members recalled officials had assured the committee that the case had been decided in government’s favour, the land taken over, and payments cleared, but fresh claims contradicted those statements, with officials admitting the government never had possession of the land.
“This is a new story altogether. Previous­­ly, we were told not only that the land was secured and payments made, but even that future plans for the property were finalized. Now, the narrative has completely changed,” remar­ked committee member Kha­­waja Shiraz Mahmood.

• Gas levy funds to reduce power tariffs for all consumers
ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Tuesday approved a financial bailout for Pakistan Television (PTV), a recovery plan for Rs47 billion in outstanding petroleum levy from Cynergico Refinery, and the use of funds collected under the captive levy on gas to reduce electricity rates for all consumers.
The committee also gave the green light to the construction of the Multan to Rawalpindi oil pipeline in partnership with Azerbaijan and sanctioned Rs3 billion in relief for flood-affected families in Gilgit-Baltistan. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the meeting.
The captive levy, imposed as part of the government’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), applies to gas and RLNG supplies to captive power plants of industrial units.
Introduced on July 1 it began at 5pc above the notified tariff, with scheduled increases to 10pc from Aug 1, 15pc from Feb 1, 2026, and 20pc from Aug 1, 2026. An act of parliament mandated that revenue generated from this levy be used exclusively to lower electricity tariffs for all consumer categories.
Following the levy’s introduction, some influential business groups sought to channel the funds solely towards industrial sector electricity rates. However, the Power Division resisted, citing legal obligations under the Captive Levy Act to benefit all consumers.
Adjustment mechanism
The ECC upheld the Power Division’s stance and approved a monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism to pass on the benefits of the levy to all electricity consumers. Under the system, the Petroleum Division will remit collected levy funds to the Finance Division within two days after each month closes.
The Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) will calculate the relief amounts based on electricity sales data and forward recommendations to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), which will then incorporate the benefits into consumers’ bills with a two-month lag. For example, levy collected in January will be credited in March bills based on January consumption.
Recovery
On the issue of petroleum levy recovery, the ECC approved a framework to recover approximately Rs47.5bn from Cynergico PK Limited (CPL), which has defaulted on payments since 2019. Including late payment surcharges, CPL’s liability stands at about Rs60bn.
Despite financial difficulties, CPL has resisted settling even the principal amount. The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) mediated a settlement plan, under which CPL will pay roughly Rs1bn monthly to clear the outstanding dues. The Petroleum Division was authorised to sign the settlement deed and instructed to ensure strict adherence to the repayment terms.
PTV bailout
The ECC also sanctioned an Rs11bn bailout for Pakistan Television Corporation for the current fiscal year. This move follows the government’s decision to waive the PTV fee on electricity consumers from July 1, 2025. The waiver severely impacted PTV’s revenue, leaving it unable to meet staff salaries, pensions, and other liabilities. Under the bailout plan, the Finance Ministry will immediately release Rs3.8bn to cover the first quarter’s expenses, followed by Rs2.396bn for each of the remaining three quarters. This shifts the financial burden from electricity consumers to taxpayers.
Oil pipeline
In a significant move for energy infrastructure, the ECC approved the tariff framework for the Machike-Thallian-Tarrujabba white oil pipeline, a government-to-government project with Azerbaijan. The Frontier Works Organisation, Pakistan State Oil, and Azerbaijan’s Socar will establish a joint project company to manage the pipeline.
The Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) will set a transportation tariff in US dollars applicable to the entire route from Multan to Tarrujabba (near Peshawar). The agreement requires oil marketing companies to commit to minimum annual pipeline volumes, with shortfalls compensated through inland freight equalisation margins. The tariff model is designed for optimal pipeline utilisation under a “default mode of transportation.”
The Finance Ministry’s prior demand to rationalise payouts and reduce liabilities was overruled in favour of ensuring the pipeline’s timely launch, reflecting its strategic importance in strengthening bilateral ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan.
Lastly, the ECC approved a Rs3bn relief package for flood-hit communities in Gilgit-Baltistan, aimed at providing tents, medicines, food, and other essential supplies. This humanitarian support was issued under the Prime Minister’s directives to assist those affected by recent heavy rains in the region.

While some progress has been made, major gaps persist, with people living in low-income countries, fragile contexts, rural communities, children and minority ethnic and indigenous groups face the greatest disparities, according to the report, “Progress on Household Drinking Water and Sanitation 2000-24”, published on Tuesday.
The report, with special focus on inequalities, says in 2024, 1.4 billion people lacked basic services, 287 million with limited services, and 302 million with unimproved services.
 
 

Since 2015, 961 million people have gained access to safely managed drinking water services. Coverage has increased from 68pc to 74pc. The number of people using surface water for drinking has decreased by 61 million, according to the report. In Pakistan, the least basic drinking water coverage in urban areas declined from 94pc to 93pc.
The number of people still lacking even a basic sanitation service decreased from 2.7bn to 1.5bn. In urban areas, 1.7 billion people gained safely managed services, with coverage increasing from under half of the population (48pc) to two thirds (66pc).

The study, titled “Unveiling exploitation and abuse in the brick kilns of Punjab”, was conducted in collaboration with the Pakistan Partnership Initiative.
The investigation highlighted systemic exploitation, gender-based violence, debt bondage, and widespread denial of basic labour rights to brick kiln workers.
The report was based on extensive field research in Faisalabad and Kasur — two of Punjab’s brick kiln hubs.  Surveys of 200 workers and in-depth interviews with 30 victims led to documented case studies. The study engaged trade unions, kiln owners, and officials from the Punjab Labour Department to provide a multi-stakeholder perspective.
Speaking at the launch event, NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said: “Today’s report follows months of fieldwork, interviews, and surveys identifying violence, exploitation, and abuse in Punjab’s brick kilns. It documents laws ignored, promises broken, and dignity denied.”
She said the NCHR had long been demanding reform in this most inhumane of sectors. “For all of us, ending bonded labour is not charity. It is not a favour. It is justice and human dignity. It is the fulfilment of our Constitution’s promise.”
Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court, the chief guest, said the evolution of bonded labour from colonial bondage to constitutional protection showed progress, but the brick kiln horrors reminded of unfinished work.
“It is incumbent not just on the judiciary but also on the legislative and executive branches to work towards correcting these horrors and let this report ignite collective action for a Pakistan where no worker is bonded, and dignity prevails,” Justice Jawad Hassan said.
He called for legislative reforms, judicial and institutional strengthening and collaborative action to end this extreme form of exploitation.
Violation of Constitution
Abdul Khalique Shiekh, the Secretary, Ministry of Human Rights, said: “Bonded labour is a violation of our Constitution, our laws, and our commitments under international human rights treaties.”  He said the government had taken important steps to ensure that brick kiln workers live a life of dignity, citing amendments to labour laws, initiatives like the Elimination of Bonded Labour in brick kilns project  and efforts to regulate advances. “But we know more is needed.”
 
 

Abdul Khalique Shiekh said such studies were essential to show where gaps remained between law and enforcement, between policy and practice. “They remind us that passing laws is only the first step. Implementation is the true test of justice.”
Ashraf Wadhawa Mall, the PPI CEO, said the study had exposed the extreme conditions faced by brick kiln workers. He said so far 2,339 families from brick kilns across the country had been rescued and rehabilitated.
The study documents extreme abuses ranging from verbal and physical harassment to cases of abduction and even murder. Women workers remained especially vulnerable, subjected to rampant sexual harassment, coercion, and forced marriages. Workers continued to labour in unsafe, unhygienic, and exploitative conditions under extreme weather, often receiving wages well below the legal minimum and having no access to social security.
The study showed that 97 per cent workers entered kilns because of urgent loans, 90pc had no written contracts, leaving them invisible to labour protection efforts and over 70pc of families lived in a single cramped room. It said 92pc workers reported verbal abuse, many described beatings, torture and even abductions.

The decision was taken on Tuesday at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti and attended by provincial Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan, Principal Secretary Babar Khan and banking sector expe­rts. It reviewed an initial feasibility report for the project and declared it viable.
The chief minister dire­cted the officials concer­ned to prepare a comprehensive and operational plan within one week. “The Bank of Balochistan will be a revolutionary step aimed at providing high-quality and accessible banking services to the business community, traders, industrialists, investors and common people,” Mr Bugti said.
He added that the initiative would not only boost economic activity but also generate employment opp­o­r­t­unities for the youth. “The Bank of Balochistan will prove to be a milestone in stabilising the provincial economy and will accelerate development projects by utilising local resources,” he said.
 
 

Mr Bugti assured the public that they would soon receive good news regarding the project, saying the bank would initially meet provincial needs but could also play a role at the national level in future.
Banking experts, who joined the meeting via video link, stressed the importance of the decision, saying the establishment of a provincial bank would make financial resources available for development projects.
The idea of setting up the Bank of Balochistan was first announced in the provincial budget for fiscal year 2007-08 by then finance minister Syed Ehsan Shah during the coalition government of Nawab Aslam Khan Raisani. In the 2017-18 budget, then finance minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi allocated Rs10 billion for the project, but it did not materialise for unspecified reasons.

• Jailed founder refuses to accept Salman Akram Raja’s resignation; throws his weight behind Achakzai as potential replacement for NA opposition leader
ISLAMABAD: Changing its mind once again, the PTI has decided to boycott the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assemblies, in line with the opinion of its incarcerated leader, Imran Khan.
The decision was taken by the party’s political committee, which met to consider Mr Khan’s input following a meeting with his legal team at Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan’s message was relayed to the media by his sister, Aleema Khan, who also met Mr Khan in prison.
She was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — whose resignation was reportedly turned down by the incarcerated former PM.
Denying reports of a bitter exchange with Mr Raja, she said the lawyer was “like family” to them. She said her brother had asked the party’s political committee to hold another meeting on the by-election issue based on his instructions, and report back to him.
Later on Tuesday night, PTI MNA Amir Dogar confirmed that the political committee had endorsed Imran Khan’s opinion on not contesting by-elections, adding that party lawmakers would also start quitting parliamentary bodies soon.
Imran’s view
Talking about nominations to appoint new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, Salman Akram Raja said that for them, Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
 
 

“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai,” he said.
Mr Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
A day earlier, the party’s political committee had voted 12-9 to take part in the by-elections. Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had even tweeted that candidates would be given Sunni Ittehad Council tickets to avoid the chances of their being declared ‘independents’.
According to insiders, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, Salman Akram Raja, SIC leader Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Arif Alvi, Sajjad Burki, ex-GB CM Khalid Khursheed and some others were against the decision to take part in by-polls, while those in favour included Aliya Hamza, Sanaullah Mastikhel, Aamir Dogar, Farhat Abbas and others.
Talking to Dawn, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser confirmed that in Imran Khan’s opinion, the party should not go into by elections, and that its lawmakers should leave all parliamentary standing committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
“Parliament has already been made a rubber stamp, as the voice of the opposition members has been suppressed by not telecasting their remarks on the floor of the house. Secondly, after the passage of the 26th constitutional amendment, courts have come under immense pressure,” he added.
Mr Qaiser said that the jailed PTI founder had given his opinion, and asked the party’s political committee to review its decision.
“Imran Khan was of the view that the government will not let the PTI candidate to win by-elections… [and] if [we] take part in the elections, it will legitimise the government’s illegal action of de-seating PTI legislators,” he said. He, however, said the PTI will continue its street protests and continue to approach the courts to seek justice.
When contacted, Mustafa Nawaz Khaokhar – who is part of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance alongside the PTI – said there seemed to be two opinions in the party regarding by-elections, one suggesting that it should not legitimise the de-seating of its lawmakers, while the other was opposed to ceding political space.
He agreed that this was causing a visible rift in the PTI’s ranks, which had created disappointment in the party workers.
Commenting on the situation, political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said it was quite unfortunate that the decision taken by the party’s political committee to contest by-elections was reversed by jailed founder Imran Khan.
The PTI is more of a ‘one-man show’ than any other political party, he noted.
He also noted with irony that the party had decided, once again, to leave all parliamentary committees, especially the PAC. “This is the same act it committed when it left the National Assembly and ceded all provinces, where it was ruling, one by one,” he added.
