After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population — Israel expanded its assault by launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences last week, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians..
Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

As long-standing foes Iran and Israel continued their air war for a fifth day, both warned of intensifying their warfare.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said a “more powerful” new wave of missiles had recently been launched towards Israel, Al Jazeera reported, citing the official IRNA news agency.
“A new wave of fierce attacks by the armed forces, especially the army’s ground forces, with new and advanced weapons has begun and will intensify in the coming hours,” it quoted Kioumars Heydari, commander of the Army Ground Forces, as saying.
On the other side, Major General Shlomi Binder, chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate, said Israel would soon “break ground” in areas of Iran besides Tehran, Times of Israel reported.
“You brought the intelligence that paved the way to Tehran and enabled the strike on the Iranian general staff. Soon, you’ll break ground in additional areas. You’ve proven that you can push boundaries and reach any target,” Binder told officers today, according to an army statement.
Tensions have escalated since Friday, with more than 224 Iranians killed and over 1,000 injured, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, mostly civilians.
Three more people were killed while four others were wounded when an Israeli projectile hit a checkpoint in Isfahan’s Kashan city this morning, local security official Akbar Salehi said, according to a Mehr news agency report quoted by Al Jazeera.
Iranian media reported explosions and heavy air defence fire in Tehran earlier today. Air defences were also activated in Natanz, home to key nuclear installations 320km away, the Asriran news website reported. A White House aide said it was not true that the US was attacking Iran.
US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said a missile strike lightly damaged a building used by the American embassy in Tel Aviv. The State Department had warned Americans not to travel to Israel.
In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv after midnight and again early in the morning, when several explosions were heard over the city.
There were two direct impacts from those Iranian missiles — one in the Tel Aviv area and one in Herzliya. Israeli reports described the missile strike in Herzliya as having targeted a sensitive site, Al Jazeera reported.
The report added that a sensitive site was code for something of military or strategic significance.
Israel’s military also claimed that it had killed Ali Shadmani, Iran’s wartime chief of staff and the most senior military commander, AFP reported.
It also said it targeted multiple missile and UAV sites in western Iran, including surface-to-surface missile infrastructure, surface-to-air launchers and drone storage facilities, in a statement accompanied by black-and-white footage showing missile launchers exploding.
Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “of a fate similar to Saddam Hussein”, referring to Iraq’s former president who was sentenced to death in 1959, Times of Israel reported.
 
 

While Trump had reportedly vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility when asked about the reports during an interview with ABC News.
“It’s not going to escalate the conflict, it’s going to end the conflict,” he said.
Netanyahu said Israel was eliminating Iran’s security leadership “one after the other”. “We are changing the face of the Middle East, and that can lead to radical changes inside Iran itself,” he said.
G7 calls for regional de-escalation, says no to Iran having nuclear weapons
Earlier today, the G7 countries — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — called for a wider regional de-escalation that would lead to a ceasefire in Gaza. They also stated their conviction that Iran “can never have a nuclear weapon”.
“We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,” said the G7 joint statement released by Canada.
The statement said that Israel “has a right to defend itself” and stressed “the importance of the protection of civilians,” as the growing attacks kill civilians on both sides.
Trump told reporters before his decision was announced to leave early due to  the Middle East situation: “As soon as I leave here, we’re going to be doing something.”
He later stated that his early departure from the summit had “nothing to do with” working on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, refuting comments by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the US president made a ceasefire proposal.
Macron “mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘ceasefire’ between Israel and Iran”, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform as he left the moot to return to Washington.
“Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a ceasefire. Much bigger than that,” Trump added in the post.

Macron said earlier today that Trump had made an offer for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.
“There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions,” Macron told reporters at the G7.
 


Trump has repeatedly declined to say if the United States would participate in Israeli military action, although he has said Washington was not involved in initial strikes, and the White House said that US forces remained in a defensive posture.
A US official had said Trump would not sign a draft statement from G7 leaders calling for a de-escalation of the conflict. The draft statement had stated Iran must never have a nuclear weapon and that Israel has the right to defend itself.
Separately, Macron called for strikes against civilians in Iran and Israel to end, as he warned against forcing regime change in Tehran.
“If the United States can achieve a ceasefire, that’s a very good thing,” Macron told reporters at the G7 summit in Canada. Fox News reported he would convene his National Security Council.
Macron called on both Israel and Iran to “end” strikes against civilians and warned that aiming to overthrow Tehran’s clerical state would be a “strategic error”.
“All who have thought that by bombing from the outside you can save a country in spite of itself have always been mistaken,” he said.
US ‘still aiming’ for nuclear deal
Trump has said he “wants ‘a real end’ to the nuclear problem with Iran”, while predicting that Israel would not be slowing its attacks on Iran, according to comments shared by CBS journalist Jennifer Jacobs on X.
“You’re going to find out over the next two days. You’re going to find out. Nobody’s slowed up so far,” CBS journalist Jennifer Jacobs quoted Trump as saying on Air Force One.
US would “come down so hard if they (Iran) do anything to our people”, Trump warned, according to the reporter.
Trump said “I may”, on the prospect of sending US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance to meet with Iran. However, he added that “it depends what happens when I get back”, according to Jacobs.
Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to urge Trump to pressure Netanyahu to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, according to two Iranian and three regional sources.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran even as hostilities have escalated between Israel and Tehran, while a White House aide said separately that Washington was not attacking Iran.
“Of course,” Hegseth said on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters Primetime” show when asked if Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran.
“We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that’s what happens here,” Hegseth said.
“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on X.
“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue.”
 






Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel was committed to eliminating threats posed by Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, adding, “If this can be achieved in another way — fine. But we gave it a 60-day chance.”
FMs from 20 Muslim states call for ending Israeli hostilities
Meanwhile, in a joint statement, Pakistan and 19 other countries’ foreign ministers strongly condemned Israel’s recent military attacks against Iran, calling for de-escalation and swift return to negotiations for a sustainable agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme.
The statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates.
 






Their top diplomats called for the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction, which should apply to all states in the region without exception, in line with relevant international resolutions. There is also an urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), they emphasised.
The foreign ministers highlighted the paramount importance of refraining from targeting nuclear facilities that were under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, in accordance with relevant IAEA resolutions and United Nations Security Council decisions, as such acts constituted a violation of international law and international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
Iran is a party to the NPT, whereas Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple UN resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under IAEA safeguards.
Later in the day, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq received a call from his UAE counterpart, the Foreign Office said. “They expressed deep concern over the escalating tensions and underscored the urgent need to support efforts for ensuring regional peace and stability.”
 






Countries evacuate their nationals from Iran
Meanwhile, with security concerns growing and Israeli airspace closed because of the war, the Chinese embassy in Israel urged Chinese citizens to leave the country via land border crossings as soon as possible.
Flights carrying evacuees from Israel arrived in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, authorities said, making these countries among the first to get their citizens out of the Middle East.
Slovak authorities said that the first evacuation flight with 73 people, including 25 Slovak tourists and five family members of Slovak diplomats working in Tel Aviv, had arrived in the capital, Bratislava, late on Monday.
The Japanese government was looking into “various options” to evacuate Japanese nationals from affected areas, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters today.
India’s foreign ministry said Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for safety in light of the conflict, while others who are “self-sufficient” in terms of transport have been advised to move out too.
“Separately, some Indians have been facilitated to leave Iran through the border with Armenia,” the ministry said.
Earlier today, Trump urged civilians to evacuate Tehran “immediately” amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran.
“Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again!
“Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” he said on his Truth Social platform.

Broadcaster says 3 killed in attack on its building
The Iran-Israel air war — the biggest battle ever between the two longtime enemies — escalated on Monday with Israel targeting Iran’s state broadcaster and uranium enrichment facilities.
Last night, Iran’s state TV resumed live coverage after an Israeli attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) building that the broadcaster said killed three people, AFP reported.
“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”
The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly condemned Israel’s strike on IRIB and called for an end to the “bloodshed”, Al Jazeera reported.
“CPJ is appalled by Israel’s bombing of Iran’s state TV channel while live on air,” CPJ Regional Director for the Middle East Sara Qudah said.
“Israel’s killing, with impunity, of almost 200 journalists in Gaza has emboldened it to target media elsewhere in the region. This bloodshed must end now.”
IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told the BBC that the Natanz plant sustained extensive damage, likely destroying 15,000 centrifuges, while Iran’s Fordow plant remained largely intact.
Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agreed to US demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear programme. Talks between the US and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for June 15 but were scrapped, with Tehran saying the attacks made the dialogue “meaningless”.
“As I’ve been saying, I think a deal will be signed, or something will happen, but a deal will be signed, and I think Iran is foolish not to sign,” Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday.
Yesterday, Israel’s Haifa-based Bazan Group said all refinery facilities have been shut down after a power station used to produce steam and electricity were significantly damaged in an attack by Iran, according to a regulatory filing.
The group said the Iranian attack resulted in the death of three company employees. The refinery is located in Haifa Bay, according to Israeli media.

The flight left India’s Kochi city, where it had a layover, for the Delhi airport carrying 157 passengers and six crew members at 9:31am IST (9:01am PKT). The Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) said the threat was received on its official email address, Press Trust of India reported.
All passengers of the IndiGo flight had been safely disembarked, according to Nagpur Deputy Commissioner of Police Lohit Matani.
While an investigation was underway, preliminary checks did not find anything suspicious, officials said.
After the bomb threat was received by the CIAL airport, a Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was convened and the threat was declared as “specific”.
As per ANI, a similar incident happened on Monday, where a Lufthansa flight LH752 scheduled to fly from Frankfurt to India’s Hyderabad, was forced to return to Germany after a bomb threat was received through an email at Hyderabad airport at 6:01pm IST (5:31pm PKT) on June 15.
A committee was formed to assess the threat as per the standard operating procedure.
On June 13, an Air India flight AI 379 flying from Phuket to New Delhi with 156 passengers on board also received a bomb threat and was forced to land back in the southern Thai island after making a wide loop around the Andaman Sea.
The incident followed the crash on an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on June 12, shortly after takeoff, killing at least 271 people, including nearly 30 people on the ground.
Bomb threat diverts plane of Haj pilgrims within Indonesia
Separately, a plane carrying hundreds of Haj pilgrims back from Saudi Arabia was diverted in Indonesia today after an email bomb threat was sent to authorities, Indonesia’s aviation body said.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it received a report from Indonesia’s airport operator “regarding a bomb threat sent by an unidentified person via electronic mail”.
The email at 7:30am (5:30am PKT) contained a threat to “blow up” Saudia Airlines flight SV 5276, which was flying from Jeddah to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, it said in a statement.
After 10am (8am PKT) the pilot diverted the plane from its destination of Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to Kualanamu International Airport in Medan, a city on Sumatra island in western Indonesia.
The flight was carrying 442 Haj pilgrims, including 207 men and 235 women, it added.
“Upon identifying security and safety threats, the pilot decided to divert the landing to the nearest airport,” said InJourney Airports, Indonesia’s airport operator.
A transport ministry official told AFP the plane was still in Medan, and Flightradar24 showed the plane there.
The airport evacuated the pilgrims, and a bomb disposal unit swept the plane for explosive devices, the aviation body said in its statement.</p><small>2025-06-17 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17140309e5012b6.jpg?r=140326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917681/despite-law-us-tiktok-ban-likely-to-remain-on-hold' target='_blank'><strong>Despite law, US TikTok ban likely to remain on hold</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is widely expected to extend the Thursday deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States.
It would be the third time Trump put off enforcing a federal law requiring its sale or ban, which was to take effect the day before his January inauguration.
“I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said in an NBC News interview in early May. “If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.”
Trump said a group of purchasers is ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance “a lot of money” for the video-clip-sharing sensation’s US operations.
Trump has repeatedly downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business.
The president is “just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,” said independent analyst Rob Enderle. “Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.”
Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters’ support in the November election.
“Trump’s not really doing great on his election promises,” Enderle maintained.
“This could be one that he can actually deliver on.”
 
 

Digital Cold War?
Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.
TikTok “has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,” said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.
“National security, economic policy, and digital governance are colliding,” Singh added.
The Republican president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office.
A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19.
As of Monday, there was no word of a TikTok sale in the works.
Tariff turmoil
Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over tariffs imposed by Washington on Beijing.
ByteDance has confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be “subject to approval under Chinese law”.
Possible solutions reportedly include seeing existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
Additional US investors, including Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance’s share in the new TikTok.
 
 

Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm.
“TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it’s simply not as powerful,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
Meanwhile, it appears TikTok is continuing with business as usual.
TikTok on Monday introduced a new “Symphony” suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for advertisers to turn words or photos into video snippets for the platform.
“With TikTok Symphony, we’re empowering a global community of marketers, brands, and creators to tell stories that resonate, scale, and drive impact on TikTok,” global head of creative and brand products Andy Yang said in a release.</p><small>2025-06-17 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17141231c59e53a.jpg?r=141330' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917680/karachi-once-again-ranks-among-least-liveable-cities-in-global-survey' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi once again ranks among least liveable cities in global survey</strong></a><br><p>Karachi once again ranked in the bottom five of the world’s “least liveable cities” in a global survey by The Economist.
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the metropolis ranked 170 on a list of 173 countries — just above Dhaka, Tripoli and Damascus — and had a score of 42.7 on the index score, with a score of 100 being “most liveable”.
It was the only Pakistani city to feature on the list, albeit poorly.
 


Topping the list was Copenhagen, with a score of 98. Vienna and Zurich tied for second place at 97.1, followed by Melbourne at 97.0, and Geneva with a score of 96.8.
The annual survey, designed to help companies calculate hardship allowances when they relocate staff, rates 173 cities across five categories: health care, culture and environment, education, infrastructure and stability, according to The Economist.
In last year’s ranking, Karachi compared with Lagos, Tripoli, Algiers and Damascus. The year before, Karachi was ranked 169 out of 173 countries
Last October, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank said the livability of cities in Pakistan is decreasing, and urban centres in the country are becoming increasingly inefficient, scoring low on multiple competitiveness indexes, with congestion, unattractiveness and pollution.
The ADB report assessed that class division was a major problem in Karachi since most of the elite live in cantonment areas or private housing societies, while those on low incomes have been pushed to the city’s largest district, Karachi East.
The city is further divided along religious and ethnic lines, which has led to several outbreaks of violence in the past. Karachi is the only city in Pakistan that, to some degree, is expanding vertically due to limited land and urgent housing needs, the report said.
In July, Karachi was ranked as the second riskiest city for tourists with a rating of 93.12 out of 100 according to a Forbes Adviser list.
Per the ranking, Karachi had the highest personal security risk, reflecting risk from crime, violence, terrorist threats, natural disasters, and economic vulnerabilities.
The list said Karachi had the second-worst (level 3, reconsider travel) travel safety rating from the US State Department. It further said that the metropolis had the fourth-highest infrastructure security risk, reflecting the availability and quality of city infrastructure.</p><small>2025-06-17 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171343286cb6102.jpg?r=134343' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917678/pm-shehbaz-reiterates-commitment-to-defending-pakistans-right-to-water' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reiterates commitment to defending Pakistan’s right to water</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated Pakistan’s commitment towards defending its right to water, terming the Indus River as the “lifeline” of the people of Pakistan, in his message on “World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought”.
Observed on June 17 every year, the annual day highlights global urgency against drought. Climate Risk Index 2025 ranks Pakistan 1st among top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2022, with over 68 per cent of its land area now classified as arid or semi-arid. Prolonged droughts in Balochistan, Sindh and South Punjab continue to push vulnerable communities deeper into poverty.
In a statement released by the PM’s office, PM Shehbaz raised alarm over India’s unilateral action to hold the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance, calling it a “serious concern”.
“There is no provision for such actions under the Treaty, and the waters of the Indus are the lifeline of the 240 million people of Pakistan,” he added, vowing to defend Pakistan’s right to water.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international obligations, “particularly those agreements that are vital to regional peace.” PM Shehbaz also promised to accelerate efforts to enhance the country’s domestic water storage capacity.
 
 

On the issue of land, PM noted that “nearly 50pc of our land area is affected by various forms of degradation driven by deforestation, overgrazing, salinity, waterlogging, and unplanned urbanisation”.
These issues are made worse by climate change, which has “intensified the frequency and severity of droughts, wildfires, and floods,” the statement added, citing the 2022 floods and recurring dry spells to highlight the scale of the problem.
He underscored the importance of land as an asset for Pakistan’s food security, water availability, biodiversity conservation, and rural livelihoods.
Over one million km of productive land — about 113pc of Pakistan’s total land area — is lost worldwide to degradation every year, requiring $1 billion in daily investments for restoration between 2025 and 2030, according to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
 
 

PM lauded this year’s theme, “Restore the land. Unlock the opportunities,” as a “timely call” for the restoration of degraded land. He stressed that restoration is “essential not only for climate resilience but also for unlocking social, economic, and environmental benefits”.
Detailing the government’s efforts towards climate resilience, he stated that sustainable land management and ecosystem restoration remain “key pillars” of the government’s climate resilience agenda.
Landmark initiatives like the upscaling of the Green Pakistan Programme have resulted in the plantation of over 2.2 billion plants, he observed.
The statement further quoted him as saying: “We are also implementing the National Climate Change Policy and National Adaptation Plan to guide integrated land use and enhance ecological integrity.
“These policy frameworks align with our commitments under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), to which Pakistan has been a Party since 1997.”
PM Shehbaz urged all stakeholders to join hands in restoring degraded land and securing a climate-resilient future for future generations.
In March, Paki­stan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) issued a drought alert for Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab due to scant rainfall.</p><small>2025-06-17 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17133040d183145.png?r=134155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917677/pm-shehbaz-for-linking-reko-diq-with-railway-network-by-2028' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz for linking Reko Diq with railway network by 2028</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday directed relevant authorities to link the Reko Diq project in Balochistan with the Pakistan Railway’s line network by 2028 to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
In January, Saudi Arabian mining fund Manara Minerals said it was set to buy a 10-20 per cent stake in the Reko Diq copper and gold project in Pakistan for proceeds of about $500 million to $1 billion.
In April, the Reko Diq Joint Venture shareholders approved the project’s updated feasibility study and conditionally approved the associated Phase-1 development capital, subject to securing up to $3 billion in project financing.
While chairing a meeting today, PM Shehbaz issued orders for the formation of an inter-ministerial committee to look after financing matters for upgrading and developing Pakistan Railways.
The committee will present recommendations with regards to financing required for Pakistan Railways’s development and its extension to Reko Diq.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the upgradation of ML-1 and ML-3 railway as well as the overall development of Pakistan Railways to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
The premier noted that Pakistan Railways served as a backbone for the country’s economy and communication.
“Pakistan Railways is a cheap, fast and environment friendly source of transportation,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that the mines and mineral sector of Balochistan will develop, and new employment opportunities will be created for the people of the area after linking railways with Reko Diq.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi, and senior government officials.</p><small>2025-06-17 08:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17130903e912083.jpg?r=133403' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917675/army-chief-lauds-overseas-pakistanis-contributions-during-us-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief lauds overseas Pakistanis’ contributions during US visit</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has expressed his deep appreciation for the significant role being played by overseas Pakistanis as ambassadors of the country during his official visit to the United States, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Field Marshal Munir arrived in Washington on Sunday for a five-day official visit aimed at reinforcing military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the United States, diplomatic sources confirmed.
The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14, despite its timing.
“During the visit, the COAS interacted with the overseas Pakistani community in Washington DC,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the interaction, the COAS expressed his deep appreciation for the vital and most significant role being played by overseas Pakistanis for being ambassadors of Pakistan,” the press release continued.
He acknowledged their contributions to Pakistan’s economy and global reputation through remittances, investments and higher achievements in other domains.
The ISPR added that COAS received a warm reception and welcome from the overseas Pakistanis, who gathered in large numbers to meet with the army chief.
According to the military’s media wing, the diaspora warmly appreciated the outstanding performance of Pakistan’s armed forces during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos/Marka-e-Haq, showcasing their bravery and professionalism.
 
 

The overseas Pakistanis shared their experiences and suggestions with the army chief. He emphasised the importance of engagement with the overseas Pakistanis, highlighting the need for continued collaboration and cooperation to address common challenges and promote cooperation.
“The interaction concluded with a renewed sense of purpose and commitment, as the COAS and the overseas Pakistanis pledged to work together towards a more secure, prosperous, and resilient Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade on the occasion of the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations, but some sources speculated that he had spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida.
The sources had said that the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.</p><small>2025-06-17 08:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17123320a776bf8.png?r=123352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US agree to advance talks on reciprocal tariffs: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their economic partnership as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington in April on countries around the world.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary,  Howard Lutnick, last night. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.
“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards competitive economy.”
Aurangzeb continued that both sides agreed to advance negotiations on reciprocal tariffs through constructive engagement, aiming to finalise the trade deal at the earliest.
The discussions focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment, and strengthening mutually beneficial economic ties, he said.
“Both sides also agreed that further technical-level discussions would take place in the coming days, following a mutually agreed roadmap,” the finance minister added.
As regards pension reforms, the finance minister said the Defined Contribution Pension Scheme is a “win-win” for both the government and the employees.
In June last year, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved major changes to the federal government’s pension system. The finance ministry said federal government employees would contribute 10pc of their basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc.
At today’s event, Aurangzeb said the government has increased the pension of retired employees by 7pc in line with inflationary trends.
“We have also proposed a 5pc tax on pensions above Rs10 million while protecting low and middle income pensioners,” he said.
Two important visits from Pakistan to the United States — one by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the other by a trade delegation — due this week were postponed due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, official sources told Dawn earlier this week.
The three-day visit would be the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between Islamabad and Washington amid a fragile regional security climate following last month’s military standoff between India and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-17 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/171147291930468.jpg?r=123734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917666/russian-overnight-attack-on-kyiv-kills-14-injures-44' target='_blank'><strong>Russian overnight attack on Kyiv kills 14, injures 44</strong></a><br><p>Waves of Russian drones and missiles struck districts across the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Tuesday, killing 14 people and injuring 44, according to the interior ministry.
The Russian attack struck 27 locations around the capital, damaging residential buildings, educational institutions, and critical infrastructure facilities, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.
“Today, the enemy spared neither drones nor missiles,” he said about what he called one of the largest attacks on the city since Russia launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Reuters witnesses said drones swarmed over the capital and they heard what appeared to be missiles overhead. An air raid alert remained in effect more than seven hours after it had been proclaimed.
Other parts of the country also came under attack, including a region outside the capital where one person was injured and the southern region of Odesa, where 13 people were injured, according to local authorities.
Klymenko said a ballistic missile struck a nine-storey residential building in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, destroying a section of it. He said the emergency services were racing to search through the rubble for any possible survivors.
Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that a 62-year-old US citizen had died in a dwelling opposite a site where medics were providing assistance during the attack. Klymenko said the man died from shrapnel wounds.
Both Ukraine and Russia have launched drone attacks in recent weeks as the two sides have held two sessions of direct talks on ending the more than three-year-old war. The talks have produced agreements on freeing prisoners of war and returning the bodies of fallen soldiers, but little more.
“More strikes by Russian drones on residential buildings in Kyiv,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. “Russia is continuing its war on civilians.”
Russian air defence units intercepted and destroyed 147 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, including the Moscow region, overnight, Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-06-17 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17121025ff55e51.jpg?r=121031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917669/openai-wins-200m-contract-with-us-military' target='_blank'><strong>OpenAI wins $200m contract with US military</strong></a><br><p>The US Department of Defence on Monday awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to put generative artificial intelligence (AI) to work for the military.
San Francisco-based OpenAI will “develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains”, according to the department’s posting of awarded contracts.
The programme with the defence department is the first partnership under the startup’s initiative to put AI to work in governments, according to OpenAI.
OpenAI plans to show how cutting-edge AI can vastly improve administrative operations such as how service members get health care and also cyber defenses, the startup said in a post.
All use of AI for the military will be consistent with OpenAI usage guidelines, according to the startup.
 
 

Big tech companies are increasingly pitching their tools to the US military, among them Meta, OpenAI and, more predictably, Palantir, the AI defense company founded by Peter Thiel, the conservative tech billionaire who has played a major role in Silicon Valley’s rightward shift.
OpenAI and defense tech startup Anduril Industries late last year announced a partnership to develop and deploy AI solutions “for security missions.”
The alliance brings together OpenAI models and Anduril’s military tech platform to ramp up defenses against aerial drones and other “unmanned aircraft systems”, according to the companies.
“OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said at the time.</p><small>2025-06-17 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17114330ef0baa0.jpg?r=120902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917552/islamabad-police-announce-arrest-of-iiui-students-killer-as-activists-demand-proof' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad Police announce arrest of IIUI student’s killer as activists demand proof</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While Islamabad police on Monday claimed to have arrested the alleged killer of a 22-year-old female student of International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), human rights activists demanded adequate proof to ensure that the actual perpetrator had been apprehended.
Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Islamabad Mohammad Jawad Tariq told a press conference at Rescue 15 that they had achieved a major success by tracing and arresting the suspect in the blind murder case.
“The arrested accused has been identified as Feroz, a resident of Jhang, who had gone into hiding after the incident,” the DIG added.
He said the arrested man had entered a girls’ hostel and fired a shot at the student that led to her death. Several police teams were formed under the command of the SSP operations and SSP investigations.
“These teams employed modern techniques and human intelligence to arrest the accused. Police teams obtained sketches of the suspect, videos from nearby buildings and footage from Safe City Islamabad cameras, which helped ensure his arrest. The arrested accused has a criminal record, including previous charges for rape and several motorcycle thefts,” he claimed.
The DIG said a case had been registered against the suspect and the investigation was ongoing. The suspect will be charged in court based on a thorough investigation and solid evidence, ensuring that he receives appropriate punishment.
Protest by Aurat March and family
Earlier in the day, Aurat March Islamabad and the family of Emaan Afroz, the student who was murdered in her hostel about two months ago, held a protest outside the National Press Club. The family expressed disappointment with Islamabad police’s efforts to arrest the culprit, and silence of the hostel warden who they alleged had been threatening girls against raising their voice against the murder.
The participants condemned the murder and demanded a transparent and swift inquiry into her murder, holding those responsible accountable for their actions. They demanded that the lack of accountability and systemic failures that enable such tragedies must be addressed.

They also demanded transparent investigation and justice for Emaan’s family, accountability for the hostel administration’s negligence, improved safety and security measures for students, particularly women, in educational institutions, implementation of policies to prevent gender-based violence and ensure prompt response to emergencies.
They condemned the police’s tactics to silence the family and asking them not to make details of the case public, which was a clear attempt to keep the criminals safe.
They demanded that every case in which a woman was subjected to violence should be given the same priority by the state and the government.
Rights activist Farzana Bari, who attended the protest, while talking to Dawn said that it was unfortunate that the police were pressuring the family of the deceased for the last 50 days.
“We had announced to hold protest three days ago but police approached us and requested not to hold the protest claiming that they were close to the suspect.
After holding the protest police held a press conference claiming that it had arrested the suspect. However, we will verify if the suspect is the same as the family has footage of the murderer,“ she said.
The protesters marched from Super Market to NPC and also held a candlelit vigil.

FFCL shared this development in a stock filing on Monday. 
The 234th board meeting of FFCL was held on June 13, at which the decision to acquire PIA shares was taken. 
The government last month extended the deadline to submit EoI for buying PIACL until June 19 from June 3 deadline with all terms and conditions remaining the same.
In a surprising turn of events, the People’s Unity of Pakistan International Airlines employees’ union, which had previously opposed the privatisation of PIA, has now submitted a bid to the Privatisation Commission to acquire shares of PIA and gain management control. 
While submitting the EoI, the joint letter, signed by the central president of People’s Unity of PIA Employees, Hadayat Ullah, and president of PIA Senior Staff Association of PIA, states that “our intention is supported by our experience of decades, knowledge of industry practices and allied factors.”

• Govt employees’ salaries up by 10pc
• Minimum pay raised to Rs40,000
• 50,000 families to get house loans

• Credible plan to boost tax revenues missing
LAHORE: The PML-N government in Punjab on Monday proposed a Rs5.33 trillion annual budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, focusing primarily on large infrastructure schemes and freebies for the urban middle classes, especially the youth, as well as small industries and farmers to regain the political ground it had lost in its stronghold in the 2024 election.
The budget features a record Rs1.24tr Annual Dev­elop­ment Programme (ADP), which is Rs240 billion or 25pc greater than the federal Public Sector Development Progr­amme (PSDP), and commits to produce Rs740bn in estimated provincial surplus to meet a key IMF goal to hold down consolidated federal budget deficit.
The Provincial Consoli­dated Fund also includes a one-time income of Rs160bn under the head of ‘supernume­rary resource’ from an undisclosed source. This kind of irregular income is normally used to bridge the budget deficit. In this case, it is speculated to have been added to meet the provincial surplus condition of the IMF programme.
Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman presented the budget in Punjab Assembly.
The budget focuses the social sector with whopping allocations for health, education, infrastructure, local government, public safety and agriculture. Cumulatively, Rs2.61tr has been allocated, including Rs630.5bn, Rs811.8bn and Rs129.8bn for health, education and agriculture, respectively.
The budget, however, does not lay out a credible plan to boost tax revenues, except an incremental increase of 11.4pc to Rs525bn. The budget documents show the government had failed to collect the targeted tax of Rs471bn for the outgoing year as the collection is estimated to face a shortfall of around 10pc due to lower collection of GST on services and immovable urban property tax.
On the other hand, it reveals allocation of a considerable subsidy amounting to Rs165bn in total for various sectors, including Rs10bn, Rs40.8bn, Rs79.5bn and Rs35bn for agriculture, transport, free medicines and Ram­azan Package, respectively.
Development plan
The total layout of the budget includes ADP of Rs1.24tr—Rs398bn or 47pc more than the ongoing ADP and Rs240bn more than the PSDP for 2025-26.

Punjab has proposed a 10pc raise in the salary of all government employees (BPS 1-22) and 5pc incre­ase in the pension of the retired employees, which is 2pc less than 7pc incre­ase in pensions as annou­nced in the federal budget. The budget also proposes an increase in the minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs40,000 per month.
“We have allocated Rs148bn for education in the wake of development and Rs661bn for the non-development expenditures, which are 127pc and 24.4pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” the finance minister told the lawmakers in the House.
“I am feeling proud to say that, like FY 2024-25, the health sector would also be our priority. For next fiscal year, we have allocated a record Rs128bn, which is 131pc higher than the FY 2024-25. For non-development expenditures, Rs450bn have been allocated, 16pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” he said.
The province expects to receive Rs4tr under the Federal Divisible Pool (FDP). It estimates to collect own-source taxes amounting to Rs524bn, and own-source non-tax receipts of Rs303bn, Rs102bn in capital receipts and recovery of loans, and Rs128bn in foreign project assistance.
On expenditure side, Punjab estimates to spend Rs2.03tr (current expenditures), Rs679bn on service delivery, Rs590bn as capital expenditures, Rs58bn (Food A/C-II), Rs1.2tr (ADP) and Rs740bn as estimated surplus.
Initiatives
The government plans to introduce various initiatives, including continuation of laptop scheme for which over Rs15bn have been allocated.
The major initiatives to be launched in FY 2025-26 in various sectors include Rs101bn in education sector, over Rs72bn for health sector, Rs44.2bn for Social Welfare & PESSI, Rs4.8bn for irrigation, Rs84.5bn for transport and roads, over Rs43bn for agriculture, Rs13bn for forest; wildlife & fisheries and over Rs12bn for energy.
“In 2025-26 FY, Rs15bn will be provided as scholarships to deserving students under the Honhaar Scholarship Programme. Similarly, Rs15bn have been allocated for provision of laptops to the eligible students under CM Punjab laptop scheme during FY 2024-25,” the minister explained.
Talking about the surplus budget amounting to Rs740bn, the minister said: “To maintain the financial discipline under the agreement between the IMF and the federal government, Rs740bn EPS (estimated provincial surplus) has also been included in the budget. However, the provincial surplus’ implementation is subject to the achieving the federal revenue target by the FBR.”
During FY 2025-26, the government plans to continue the “Apni Chat Apna Ghar Programme” under which it has provided houses to 50,000 families by providing Rs48bn interest-free loans payable in 15 years. For next fiscal year, the government has proposed to earmark Rs150bn for this scheme in a bid to provide loans to 50,000 more families for construction of houses.
Another scheme titled “Apni Zameen Apna Ghar” is also under consideration to be launched in the FY 2025-26 to provide plots to deserving people free of cost in 19 districts through balloting.
The government has also increased budget for the solid waste management under Suthra Punjab Programme from Rs120bn to Rs150bn while Rs10bn have been earmarked for the parks and horticulture authorities and ex­­­pansion of water and sa­­nitation agencies to more districts.
Lahore, like the last year, would remain on priority as it would have Rs85bn for several development schemes under Lahore Development Pro­gramme. Following the LDP model, a Rs25bn special programme namely CM Punjab Development Programme has been proposed to be initiated in other cities.

“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”
The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.
 






Iran’s Mehr news agency posted visuals from the attack on the IRIB building on X.
 






Iran’s Press TV also shared a video showing the aftermath of the attack.
 






IRNA reported that “live programmes were briefly halted at the IRIB News Network but returned to normal a few minutes afterwards”.
 






The attack came shortly after Iranian media reported Israeli airstrikes in a civilian residential neighbourhood in Tehran.
 






Iran condemned Israel’s attack as a “war crime” and called on the UN Security Council to take action.
The strike on the offices of IRIB during a live broadcast was a “wicked act” and a “war crime”, said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei. “The UNSC must act now to stop the genocidal aggressor from committing further atrocities against our people,” he added.

Iran subsequently issued evacuation warnings for Israeli news channels, Iranian state TV reported.
“Iran has issued an evacuation warning for the N12 and N14 channels of Israel. This order comes in response to the hostile attack of Zionist enemy against the Islamic Republic of Iran’s broadcasting service,” state TV said.
Iran’s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the UNSC that Iran’s strikes on Israel were self-defence and were “proportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure”.
He wrote in a letter that any cooperation by third countries with Israel’s strikes on Iran “makes them complicit in the legal responsibility and consequences of this crisis”. Under Article 51 of the founding United Nations Charter, the 15-member Security Council must immediately be informed of any action that states take in self-defence against armed attack.
Separately, Iranian media outlets IRNA and Mehr claimed that the air defence in Tabriz shot down another Israeli F-35 fighter jet.
“This was the 4th Israeli F-35 fighter jet downed by Iran,” Mehr reported.
 






Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was “on the road to victory” and claimed that his air force was “in control of the skies over Tehran”, Al Jazeera reported.
Netanyahu made the remarks as he visited the Tel Nof airbase in central Israel, accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, according to the Israeli media.
“We are on our way to achieving our two objectives: eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat,” he said. Netanyahu also threatened the citizens of Tehran, telling them to leave Iran’s capital. “We are taking action.”
The latest military exchange between the arch-rivals began when Israel struck Iran’s nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top commanders and scientists. Tel Aviv has said it wants to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Dangers of further escalation loomed over a meeting of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done, but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.
Today, he said that Iran wanted to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, and should do so immediately “before it’s too late”.
“I’d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it’s too late,” Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In turn, Iran called on Trump to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war
“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.
“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”
 






Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.
The foreign ministers from France, Britain and Germany are expected to hold a call with Aragchi soon, a European diplomatic source said.
The three countries, known as the E3, are party to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and last week put forward a resolution that was approved by the UN watchdog’s Board of Governors, which declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations.
Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted an evacuation order for citizens in Tehran on his X account.
The post ordered citizens living in a specific area of the Iranian capital to “leave immediately”, warning that Israel would attack Iran’s military infrastructure in the area.
“Dear citizens, for your safety, please leave the mentioned area in the third district of Tehran immediately,” the order read, enclosing a map of the city. “Your presence in this area endangers your life.”
 






Katz also said that  Iran’s state television and radio were “about to disappear”, after the evacuation warning was issued for the district in Tehran where the broadcaster is based.
“The Iranian propaganda and incitement megaphone is about to disappear,” he said in a statement. “Evacuation of nearby residents has begun.”
The area marked for evacuation is an upmarket part of the Iranian capital home to at least four hospitals and medical centres, a major police building and state broadcaster IRIB. It also houses several embassies, including those of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait, as well as UN offices and the AFP bureau.
Earlier today, Katz threatened that residents of Tehran will “pay the price and soon” after Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa before dawn, killing at least eight people.
“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,” Katz wrote on X.
 


Israeli officials said 11 people were killed by Iranian missiles overnight, taking the overall death toll since the attacks began on Friday to 24.
Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by Anadolu Agency.
More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour said on X.
At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel’s strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.
US warship reported heading toward Mideast
The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was leaving Southeast Asia on Monday after cancelling plans to dock in Vietnam, amid reports it is headed to the Middle East to boost the US presence.
At 1:45pm GMT (6:45pm PKT), the carrier was traveling through the Malacca Strait toward the Indian Ocean, according to Marine Traffic, a ship-tracking site.
A Vietnamese government official confirmed to AFP that a planned reception aboard the USS Nimitz on June 20, as part of the ship’s expected June 19-23 visit to Danang, had been cancelled.
The official shared a letter from the US embassy announcing that the Defence Department was cancelling the event due to “an emergent operational requirement.” The US Embassy in Hanoi declined to comment to AFP, as did a spokesman for the Nimitz.
PM Shehbaz meets Iranian ambassador
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amir Moqadam on the sidelines of the International Maritime Expo and Conference in Karachi, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.
The statement said, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression on Iran and the entire nation’s sympathy with Iran over the deaths of innocent people.”
While discussing the current regional situation, the premier expressed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran and its people during the tense situation, the statement added.
Russia and Turkiye offer to mediate, condemn Israeli attacks
As the attacks did not seem to halt, Russia and Turkiye offered to facilitate the end of the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call today that his country “stands ready to undertake a facilitating role to end the conflicts as soon as possible and return to nuclear negotiations”.
Erdoğan “emphasised the importance Turkiye attaches to the preservation of peace and stability in the region”, the Turkish presidency said.
The Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow’s previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.
Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.
“This proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“You know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,” Peskov stated.
He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.
“And secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,” Peskov added.
Stating that Russia “remains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis”, Peskov said the situation was “escalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better”.
Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks to Fox News on Sunday that regime change in Iran could be a result of Israel’s military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.
The statement comes after Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help. Speaking to ABC News, Trump said he would be open to Putin being a mediator in the conflict. “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” the US president had said.
The European Union said Russia has “zero credibility” as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel after Trump suggested that Putin could play a role.
“There has been a recent Russia-Iran partnership agreement, which signals deepening cooperation across multiple areas, including foreign policy and defence,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
“In light of such, Russia cannot be an objective mediator.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel’s “act of force” against Iran and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities when they spoke by phone on Monday, the Kremlin said.
“Both sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,” a Kremlin statement said.
“The leaders spoke in favour of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the settlement of contentious issues, including those related to the Iranian nuclear programme, exclusively by political and diplomatic means.”
The two sides agreed to remain in close cooperation, the statement said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call on Monday that the conflict between Iran and Israel must end and room must be made for diplomacy as soon as possible, the Turkish presidency said.
In a statement, the presidency also said Erdogan repeated his view that the only solution to the crisis was a return to nuclear talks.
Fires in Haifa, more buildings destroyed in Tel Aviv
Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.
Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.
 


Israel’s military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.
It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.
Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred metres from the US Embassy branch in the city.
The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.
British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port, Reuters reported.
Meanwhile, an Israeli official said after a gag order was lifted that an Iranian missile struck an oil refinery in Haifa on Sunday, killing three people.
The confirmation on Monday removed reporting restrictions imposed by Israel’s military censorship on the attack.
Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the the sprawling complex early today, according to an AFP journalist.

Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.
An AFP journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an AFP journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.
Israel’s public broadcaster Kan reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.

The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.
A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.
Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news outlet termed the latest strikes on Israel the “heaviest missile attacks” since last week. It added that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had “apparently employed the ‘Fattah’ hypersonic ballistic missiles in the latest operation”.
Iran does not seek nuclear weapons: president
Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s religious edict against weapons of mass destruction.
Iran had claimed the existence of the fatwa for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.
While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity “more than ever” against the Israeli aggression, Press TV reported.

Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation’s interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.
“We have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations — for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,” he further said.
The president said the US violated international norms by “allowing” Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.
“The enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,” Pezeshkian said.
“For every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,” he added.
On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel’s attacks, Pezeshkian asked: “What crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?”
More commanders killed in Iran
IRGC intelligence chief General Mohammad Kazemi, his deputy Gen Hassan Mohaqqeq, and Gen Mohsen Baqeri were among those killed in Israel’s attacks on Sunday, the IRGC said.
 


The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.
Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran’s holy city of Mashhad in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.
Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.
Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.
“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.
According to AFP, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.
“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.
His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.
Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported AFP.
The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official Fars news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.
The execution is the third in recent weeks related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.
Iranian media, including Tasnim, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.
‘I will not leave’
In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.
“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.
“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”
Some, however, were determined to stay.
“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told AFP.
AFP images from Israel’s Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.
 






The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.
Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.
“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.
“It was a miracle we survived.”
Trump vetoes plan to target Khamenei: report
In Washington, two US officials told Reuters that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Khamenei.
“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told AFP.
When asked about the Reuters report, Netanyahu told Fox News on Sunday: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”
“We do what we need to do,” he told Fox’s ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’.
Asked whether regime change in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.
In the same interview, The Independent reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice “through proxies”.
“Through their intel, yes; they want to kill him,” he added. “He’s enemy number one,” the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.
Today, Netanyahu suggested that assassinating Khamenei would “end the conflict” between the two arch-foes.
“It’s not going to escalate the conflict, it’s going to end the conflict,” Netanyahu told ABC News in an interview when asked about reports that Trump vetoed the Israeli plan out of concern it would intensify the Iran-Israel showdown.
“The ‘forever war’ is what Iran wants, and they’re bringing us to the brink of nuclear war,” Netanyahu said. “In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.”

Trump has lauded Israel’s offensive but said Washington had nothing to do with it, while threatening to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.
However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully coordinated”.
Trump has urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to fight it out” first.
Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported the same.
FM Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.
He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”. “If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.
Iran scrapped planned nuclear talks with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.</p><small>2025-06-17 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/17103806d6962d7.jpg?r=103848' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917401/analysis-budget-2025-26-climate-budget-a-walking-contradiction' target='_blank'><strong>Analysis: Budget 2025-26 — Climate budget a ‘walking contradiction’</strong></a><br><p>• Little heed paid to building resilience through adaptation, one of the finance minister’s oft-mentioned priorities, with only Rs85.43bn earmarked for the purpose
• Funding cuts at the ministry mean less resources for ‘project-isation’ of donor funding available to the country
THE federal government has earmarked a major chunk of next year’s budget for climate-resilient development, but its failure to set a clear course of action and policy contradictions weigh heavily on financial allocations that amount to hundreds of billions.
A key feature of this climate-focused budget is the implementation of the ‘Climate Budget Tagging’ (CBT) tool, which enables the classification of climate-sensitive expenditures in line with the National Climate Change Policy.
Climate tagging was introduced under the IMF Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved earlier this year. “Tagging may be defined as the process of systematically identifying, tracking, and categorising expenditures related to climate change objectives,” according to a post on the IMF Public Financial Management Blog.
Under the $1.4 billion loan, the IMF asked Pakistan to climate-tag its Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) projects either in the category of adaptation, mitigation, or supporting areas, according to Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Research Fellow Dr Khalid Waleed.
Adaptation overlooked
In light of this demand, the government set aside Rs85.43bn for adaptation (resilience), Rs603bn for mitigation (clean energy), and Rs28.33bn for supporting areas, including capacity building, institutional development, and research.
 
 

Likewise, the government has also touted the ‘green component in subsidies’ with Rs529bn allocated to the energy sector under ‘mitigation’ — an amount deemed ‘directly favourable’. Industry and transport sectors will receive Rs9bn and R7.3bn under the same category.
For adaptation, Rs20bn has been set aside for food and Rs22bn for agriculture — both these allocations have been described as ‘indirectly favourable’.
According to this classification, a substantial amount will go to mitigation — i.e. reduction of emissions — even though the finance minister has, on multiple occasions, underscored “adaptation” as being the biggest challenge.
“While we need to deal with mitigation, the real issue — and bigger issue — is adaptation,” were his wor­ds at DawnMedia’s Breathe Pakistan conference earlier this year.
But it is seemingly on his watch that the government has earmarked a pittance for that purpose, both in terms of development funds and subsidies.
Skewed priorities
Talking to Dawn, former climate change minister Malik Amin Aslam said the budget “lacks a reprioritisation of our future economic growth model to reflect the rising challenge of climate change”. There is a need for a completely new “mindset roo­t­ed in new climate-compatible research” to address this issue, he said.
 
 

For instance, there is a need for new drought-resistant crop varieties, climate-proofing of the age-old infrastructure as well as innovative adaptation through climate crop insurance, and the enactment of early warning systems, he said. “All of that is missing in the budget,” he added. He said the climate tagging was a good exercise, but it is just “repackaging old wine in new bottles” as it rebrands existing ongoing spending, mostly on hydropower dams, as climate resilience.
Climate finance expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh argues that the steps taken in the budget were encouraging, but “are not enough” and lack transparency. A lot of money has been set aside for climate projects but there is no clarity on how these projects will be implemented, he said, adding that there is a need to specify who those allocations are for.
“The second point is to eliminate contradictions from our financial allocations. On one hand, you say that you are imposing levies (2.5pc carbon levy) to discourage the fossil fuel industry. On the other hand, you are imposing duties on the solar import and you are reducing the cost of the net metering,” he said, while also mentioning the volte-face on e-vehicles.
The EV policy measure was also criticised by Mr Aslam. “The Budget 2025 imposes a Carbon Levy to finance green development while imposing heavy taxation on Solar panels (0 to 18pc) and Hybrid EV vehicles (8 to 18pc) — a really absurd contradiction?” he wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
Mr Sheikh pointed out that if the government was serious about discouraging the use of fossil fuels, it would “incentivise transition towards solarisation, particularly by the poor segment[s] by giving them subsidies… The main point is that the policy is contradictory”.
Cuts at the ministry
The Climate Change ministry is also facing funding cuts, from Rs3.5bn to Rs2.7bn, with its spokesperson calling this a setback for climate research and technical capacity-building.
Mr Aslam, the former climate minister, agrees and warns that bud­g­et cuts will impact not only research and data-based prioritisation, but also any follow-up “project-isation” of the climate resilience funding being made available to the country.
 
 

Due to funding cuts for ministry, initiatives undertaken by it to build technical and research capacity will be hampered, spokesperson Muhammad Saleem Shaikh said.
He agreed that there was a huge gap in climate research and capacity in Pakistan and these funding cuts would further set them back. According to the official, Pakistan faces annual Rs400bn losses due to climate change.
Against this grim backdrop, the budget under the head of ‘environment protection’ has also reduced from Rs7.2bn to Rs3.1bn, with funds for ‘pollution abatement’ going down from Rs6.29bn to Rs3.1bn. The allocations for the wastewater management slightly increased from Rs967m to a little over Rs1bn.

Taking part in a lackluster debate on the federal budget for the next financial year in the National Assembly, PPP and MQM-Pakistan lawmakers expressed resentment over a number of steps proposed by the government to expand the tax net, while accusing the Centre of “totally neglecting” Sindh, particularly Karachi.
Most members belonging to the two Sindh-based parties lamented the federal government’s proposed move to give arbitrary powers to the FBR to take action against potential tax evaders, small businessmen and those failing to file their annual income returns, generally known as “non-filers”.
They also protested the “step-motherly treatment” with Sindh province by not announcing any development plan for the province, besides making meager all­o­c­ation for the under-construction Sukkur-Hydera­bad Motorway section.

Some PPP lawmakers say they won’t vote for budget; Khursheed, Naveed meet Dar on sidelines of session to relay concerns

They lamented the proposed move to impose 18 per cent tax on solar panels and asked the government to withdraw it.
Interestingly, some PPP members declared in categorical terms that they would not vote for the present budget, whereas some others, after harshly criticising the budget, stated that perhaps they would ultimately have to vote for it in line with the party policy, otherwise the whole set-up could crumble.
When the PPP lawmakers were delivering speec­hes in the National Asse­mbly, a two-member party delegation comprising Syed Khursheed Shah and Syed Naveed Qamar was conveying the party’s reservations to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in a meeting at the Parliament House.
Sources said that Mr Dar had assured the two veteran PPP MNAs that he would convey their reservations to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and that the government would make serious efforts to remove their concerns.
“Whatever is the party policy, how can we vote for an anti-Sindh budget and when the federation treats Sindh step-motherly?” said PPP’s Nabil Gabol while taking part in the debate.
The MNA from Karachi’s Lyari area said the present set-up was intact due to 70 votes of the PPP, stating that the government could come down crumbling within five minutes, if they withdrew their support.
“All our MNAs have informed [the party leadership] that we will not vote
for the budget until our demands are met,“ said Mr Gabol amid desk-thumping by legislators while referring to the PPP parliamentary party meeting earlier in the day.
“We want to speak, but our hands are tied due to par­ty policy …. we will have to pass the budget, otherwise this government will come down. Our two senior leaders Khursheed Shah and Naveed Qamar have gone to meet the deputy prime minister [Ishaq Dar]. We hope they will bring some good news,” said Mr Gabol.
Another PPP MNA from Karachi, Abdul Qadir Patel, said the government has a “delusion” that the PPP will support the budget. “This is not the case.”
He also criticised measures announced by the government to penalise non-filers.
Mentioning various sections of the finance bill, including Sections 114C, the PPP MNA said that many provisions in the proposed law were against the fundamental rights given in the Constitution.
Mr Patel was of the view that the government was making FBR even more powerful than FIA and NAB. He said with such measures, no one would come for investments in the country.
“We will not approve it. Anyone who can read and understand the budget will not vote for it,” said the PPP MNA.

• The most recent sighting of the world’s largest mammal was off the coast of Gadani in April last year
KARACHI: A 35-foot-long blue whale was found dead in the Arabian sea, in a remote area called Gwater Bay, between Pakistan and Iran, on Monday.
According to officials representing the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), local fisherman Ahmad Baloch spotted the dead whale floating near Kuntani, Balochistan.
“It is likely that the whale may have died a few days back in the open sea between Pakistan and Iran and drifted towards the Gwater Bay by rough sea and strong currents,” said Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser at the WWF-Pakistan.
He added that while the exact cause of the death could not be ascertained, the marine mammal might have gotten entangled in gillnets, commonly used in the coastal and offshore waters in the area for fishing.
Classified as an endangered species, blue whales, scientifically called Balaenoptera musculus, are described as the largest animals ever known to have existed.
It’s one of three baleen whales reported from Pakistan’s waters. The other two whales are the Bryde’s whale and the Arabian humpback whale.
There are four subspecies of blue whales, of which two include the pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) and the Indian Ocean blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus indica) found in the Northern Indian Ocean.
“Considering its small size, this dead blue whale sighted at Kuntani might be a pygmy blue whale,” Mr Khan shared, while expressing concern over the endangered species’ mortality.
He emphasised the need for urgent steps for its conservation. “Now all cetaceans, including whales and dolphins, are protected under the wildlife and fisheries legislations of Sindh and Balochistan. We also need to enact the federal legislation for the protection of cetaceans, including whales, in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Pakistan.”
According to the organisation, blue whale is known to be distributed in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean. There are many records of the occurrence of blue whales in Pakistan; the last blue whale was spotted off Gadani, Balochistan, on April 8, 2024.
Blue whales can reach a maximum length of about 100 feet and weigh up to 200 tonnes.

The contact was established following speeches by PPP leaders in parliament claiming that the budget offers nothing for the poor.
“PPP leader Abdul Qadir Patel, in his speech, said that the PPP will not support the money bill. So later, I contacted PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and sought support to block the bill,” former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser told Dawn.
It is worth noting that if a government fails to pass the money bill, it becomes its moral responsibility to resign.
Mr Qaiser said Raja Pervaiz Ashraf informed him that he would discuss the matter with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari once he returns to Pakistan.
When asked whether the PTI had anything to offer the PPP in return, Mr Qaiser said, “If PPP gives a positive response, it can be discussed what and how the future situation will be dealt with, and what should be the modalities.

“Pakistan is losing fertile land at an alarming rate due to desertification, droughts, and mismanaged water resources, threatening food security, livelihoods, and the very fabric of rural economies,” she said in a statement issued on Monday on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought.
 
 

“This is not just an environmental issue, it is a national emergency,” she added.
Climate Risk Index 2025 ranks Pakistan 1st among top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2022, with over 68 per cent of its land area now classified as arid or semi-arid.

Calls for accelerated investment in land restoration, regional climate cooperation, end to weaponisation of water resources

The country loses nearly 27,000 hectares of forest and productive land annually, while prolonged droughts in Balochistan, Sindh and south Punjab continue to push vulnerable communities deeper into poverty. The per capita availability of water had plu­m­­meted from 5,000 cubic metres in 1947 to less than 900 today, crossing the threshold of water scarcity.
This year’s theme — “Restore the Land. Unlock the Oppo­r­t­u­nities” — could not be more relevant for Pakistan. Healthy land underpinned food systems, climate resilience, and economic stability.
But as the UNCCD warned, over one million km² of productive land — about 113pc of Pakistan’s total land area — was lost worldwide to degradation every year, requiring $1 billion in daily investments for restoration between 2025 and 2030. Yet current global investments stand at just $66bn annually, with private sector contributions standing at a paltry 6pc.
![ .](https://www.dawn.com/news/19056010
Senator Rehman emphasised that land restoration in Pakistan must be prioritised as a climate adaptation strategy with multiple co-benefits. “Every dollar invested in land restoration yields $7-30 in economic returns. We cannot afford to ignore these numbers any longer.”
She also called on the international community to ramp up support for South Asia, urging multilateral financing mechanisms and debt relief to unlock restoration investments. “The Global South is drowning in climate losses. We need urgent support to revive our ecosystems and protect our people.”
Senator Rehman underscored the need for projects and initiatives that aimed to restore degraded ecosystems and riverine health, but warned that piecemeal projects are not enough. “We need a full-spectrum, national strategy that integrates land restoration into agricultural reform, climate adaptation, and rural development.”
She urged the government to legislate stronger protection for rangelands, invest in drought-re­silient infrastructure, and create incentives for regenerative farming and reforestation, particular­­ly in climate-vulnerable districts.

The observation came when senior counsel Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, on behalf of five IHC judges, highlighted changes in the IHC Administrative Committee. At this, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan raised an objection, stating that the issue raised by the counsel was not challenged by anyone before the CB, nor can it be discussed in rebuttal arguments.
Headed by Justice Mazhar, a five-judge CB had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz – pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
During the hearing, Barrister Ahmed on a rebuttal argued that Article 200 applies only to sub section 3 of the Constitution, stating that when a judge was transferred to another high court, he loses his seniority, similar to the process in the civil service.

No concept of ‘deputation’ in the judiciary, Justice Mazhar observes while hearing IHC judges’ seniority case

Justice Mazhar observed that there was no principle of deputation or merging a judge in another court in the judiciary, as was done in the civil service, where an employee can be absorbed to another department on deputation.
The counsel explained that if the question of service was examined, it would be found that if the cadre was the same, the seniority may not be affected. But if the cadre was different, seniority will be affected.
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar asked the Punjab government’s lawyer whether the Advocate General of Punjab had filed any application in this regard. In response, Advocate Amjad Pervez said he had presented a complete history of judges’ transfers from 1947 to 1976, adding that the Punjab government was not a party to the present case.
Justice Mazhar, however, observed that Punjab’s lawyer should have given arguments after AGP. “Don’t you know how important a 27A notice is,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding that when the Lahore High Court registrar had submitted his comments, he became the main party in this case.
Justice Panhwar observed that the court would like to hear him after Barrister Ahmed completes his arguments.
Barrister Ahmed recalled that it had been declared in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa reference that the president should always apply his independent mind before taking any important decision.
Justice Mazhar, however, observed we should keep in mind the difference between Article 200 and Article 209, adding that at the time of transfer of judges, the judiciary was consulted in four stages, but no such procedure was adopted before filing a reference against a judge under Article 209 of the Constitution.
When the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommends removal of a judge, could the President then apply his independent mind, Justice Mazhar observed, adding that in the judges transfer case, if the chief justice of the high court refuses to release the judge, the transfer can be stopped.

The written order was issued after the judge dismissed the prosecution’s plea for more time to conduct forensic tests on Mr Khan.
The judge remarked that Mr Khan’s decision to decline these polygraph and photogrammetric (fac­ial and voice analysis) tests appeared to be a deliberate tactic to shield himself from the implications of the prosecution’s evidence.
The accused will likely challenge the digital evidence during the trial by simply saying it was not analysed or verified through forensic means.
“Ultimately, this refusal of the accused may go against him,” the judge remarked.
The police had visited Adiala Jail twice to conduct tests on Mr Khan, but he refused.
The prosecution sought more time from the court, but it was denied.
The order stated that in normal cases, an investigating officer (IO) has the custody of the accused during the period of physical remand and investigation.
In that scenario, the accused has no chance to refuse these tests or participate in the investigation. Calling Mr Khan’s “unique”, the judge said he was not in the IO’s custody but confined in another case at the Adiala Jail.
He noted Mr Khan not only refused in writing to cooperate with the investigation, but he also did not meet with IO who had gone to jail to conduct the tests.
“So in this scenario this court is unable to understand how the investigation could be finalised?”
The judge concluded that these tests couldn’t be conducted without physical custody of the accused, the judge noted, and dismissed the prosecution’s request for more time.
However, he directed the IO to adopt all other legal processes to conclude the investigation.

• Says Tel Aviv has ‘weaponised’ food in besieged enclave
CAIRO: Israeli fire killed at least 40 people, half of them near an aid distribution site operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Monday, the territory’s health ministry said, as UN officials denounced Israeli-backed aid delivery methods.
Medics said at least 20 people were killed and 200 others wounded near an aid distribution site in Rafah, the latest in daily mass shootings that have killed hundreds of Palestinians trying to reach food since Israel imposed a new distribution system after partly lifting a near three-month total blockade.
Israel has put responsibility for distributing much of the aid it allows into Gaza into the hands of a new US-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates three sites in areas guarded by Israeli troops.
The United Nations has rejected the plan, saying GHF distribution is inadequate, dangerous and violates humanitarian impartiality principles.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about Monday’s reports of shootings. In previous incidents it has occasionally acknowledged troops opening fire near aid sites, while blaming fighters for provoking the violence.
Relatives arrived at Nasser Hospital to mourn the dead. Women and children wept beside bodies wrapped in white shrouds.
“We went there thinking we would get aid to feed our children, but it turned out to be a trap, a killing. I advise everyone: don’t go there,” said Ahmed Fayad, one of those who tried to reach aid on Monday.
‘Lethal distribution system’
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugees’ agency UNRWA, said in a post on X: “Scores of people have been killed & injured in the past days, including of starving people trying to get some food from a lethal distribution system.”
 






Before the new system was set up, aid had been distributed to Gaza’s 2.3 million residents mainly by UN agencies such as UNRWA, which employ thousands of staff inside Gaza and operate hundreds of sites across the breadth of the enclave.
Israel says it has had to crack down on distribution because Hamas fighters were diverting food aid. The fighters deny this and say Israel is using hunger as a weapon.
Lazzarini said Israel had not lifted restrictions on UN agencies including UNRWA bringing in aid, despite an abundance of assistance ready to be moved into the enclave.
On Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military aid coordination agency, said that this week it had facilitated the entry of 292 trucks with humanitarian aid from the United Nations and the international community, including food and flour, into Gaza.
It said the Israeli military would continue to permit the entry of humanitarian aid while ensuring it did not reach Hamas.
Before Monday’s incident, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that at least 300 people had so far been killed, and more than 2,600 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations.
In Geneva, Volker Turk, UN rights chief, told the UN Human Rights Council on Monday that Israel had “weaponised” food in Gaza. He repeated a call for investigations into deadly attacks near the GHF distribution sites.
“Israel’s means and methods of warfare are inflicting horrifying, unconscionable suffering on Palestinians in Gaza,” said Turk.
“Disturbing, dehumanising rhetoric from senior Israeli government officials is reminiscent of the gravest of crimes,” he added.
On Sunday, at least five people were killed as thousands of Palestinians approached two GHF distribution sites in the central and southern the enclave.
The GHF said in a statement that it resumed food deliveries on Sunday, distributing more than two million meals from its three distribution sites without incident.
Israel’s military campaign since October 7, 2023 has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip. Most of the population is displaced, and widespread malnutrition is a significant concern.

• SIPRI data says Pakistan continues development of new delivery systems, accumulation of fissile material
ISLAMABAD: India is adding to its nuclear stockpile, while Pakistan continues the development of new delivery systems, according to an annual report by a Swedish armament watchdog.
The arms race in South Asia is a microcosm of the “dangerous new nuclear arms race” that is emerging across the globe, as nearly all nuclear-armed states continued to modernise their arsenals in 2024, the Stockholm International  Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said.
In its annual yearbook, SIPRI warned that the nine nuclear powers — the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — are not only upgrading existing stockpiles, but also developing new nuclear weapons, amid the steady erosion of international arms control agreements.
The report highlights the continuing deterioration of global security, exacerbated by wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
“It is critical to remember that nuclear weapons do not guarantee security,” said Matt Korda, an Associate Senior Researcher with SIPRI’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Programme.
“As the recent flare-up of hostilities in India and Pakistan amply demonstrated, nuclear weapons do not prevent conflict. They also come with immense risks of escalation and catastrophic miscalculation — particularly when disinformation is rife — and may end up making a country’s population less safe, not more.”
India-Pakistan tensions
The yearbook notes that tensions between India and Pakistan briefly spilled over into armed conflict in early 2025. Both nations continued to develop new types of nuclear delivery systems in 2024.
India is believed to have slightly expanded its arsenal, increasing its stored warheads from 172 in 2024 to 180 in 2025.
Pakistan’s stockpile of 170 stored warheads remained unchanged, but the report notes its continued development of new delivery systems and accumulation of fissile material suggest its arsenal might expand over the coming decade.
 
 

India has been developing new “canisterised” missiles, which allow warheads to be transported while mated to the missile. This, along with sea-based patrols, suggests a strategic shift toward keeping some nuclear weapons deployed with their launchers during peacetime.
“These weapons are assigned to a maturing nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines”, the report said.
Both India and Pakistan are pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles.
While Pakistan remains the focus of India’s nuclear deterrent, the report states that India appears to be placing growing emphasis on longer-range weapons capable of reaching targets throughout China.
 
 

Big powers
Of the total global inventory of about 12,241 warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles for potential use.
An estimated 3,912 of those were deployed with missiles and aircraft, with around 2,100 kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles, all but a few belonging to Russia or the U.S.
According to the report, China’s nuclear arsenal has grown faster than that of any other country, reaching an estimated 600 warheads by early 2025.
Beijing has advanced work on about 350 new missile silos, and the report suggests China could have as many intercontinental ballistic missiles as either Russia or the US by the turn of the decade.
Russia and the US, together, still possess around 90 per cent of all nuclear weapons in the world. While their military stockpiles remained stable in 2024, both are implementing extensive modernisation programs.
The report warns of a likely increase in the number of warheads deployed on strategic missiles after the bilateral New START treaty expires in February 2026, unless a new agreement is reached.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday formed a committee to reexamine the matter and recommend stringent safeguards to prevent the misuse of powers by tax officers.
FBR Chairman Mah­mood Langrial told Dawn that the provisions could be revised to mandate the permission of multiple senior officers before any arrest.
In the Finance Bill introduced last week, the government proposed amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, to allow FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests.
As per the proposed amendments, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.
The proposed Section 37AA reads: “The officer of Inland Revenue, during the investigation, having reason to believe on the basis of evidence that actions of any person may have caused or attempted to cause tax fraud or any other offence warranting prosecution under this Act, may cause arrest of such person with prior approval of the Commissioner.”
The provision made the business community apprehensive about the potential abuse of power.
Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers were “draconian” and “will most likely be misused to harass” taxpayers.
But FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial told Dawn that the authority to arrest would remain intact.
However, the committee headed by the finance minister will examine various options to introduce additional safeguards to prevent potential misuse of the power.
According to Mr Langrial, existing laws empower low-ranking officers to lodge FIRs against tax defaulters.
He noted that the proposed amendments mandate prior approval from the income tax commissioner before an arrest.
Further safeguards be­ing considered include a provision for approval from three senior officers inst­ead of just the commissioner.
According to the FBR chairman, this provision would significantly reduce the potential for misuse of powers. Moreover, the officers would be empowered to arrest individuals for a limited set of violations and not for every offence of fraud, Mr Langrial explained.
He added the powers could be exercised in three circumstances: when a tax defaulter fails to appear before authorities thrice, when there is a risk of evidence being tampered with, or when there is a possibility that the suspect may flee the country.
PM’s directives
An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister Secretariat said PM Shehbaz formed the committee following a meeting to review the FBR’s performance.
According to the state-run news agency, APP, the prime minister took notice of media reports and warned the proposed powers must not be used to harass the business community or taxpayers.
Mr Langrial informed the prime minister that the authority to arrest tax defaulters has been embedded in taxation law since the 1990s.
However, in light of rec­ent rulings by superior courts, amendments are being introduced to further streamline the process.
The prime minister ordered officials to devise an effective external review system regarding the arrest matter and arrests should only be made in cases where the quantum of fraud was “exceptionally high”.
The premier said provisions for protection against misuse of these laws should be made part of the Finance Act. He called for consultations with all coalition parties on this issue.
NA committee
On Monday, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue also raised alarm over the proposed amendments.
The meeting, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, was also attended by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, who assured members that the matter would be reviewed in line with the prime minister’s directives.
The finance minister informed the committee that Senator Farooq H. Naik had proposed amendments aimed at safeguarding against the misuse of powers. He described Mr Naik’s suggestions as highly appropriate.
The prime minister has been briefed on the matter and the committee will be updated on any progress in this matter, Mr Aurangzeb said.
He assured the members that appropriate changes would be introduced following due consultation.

• Massive chunk of money spent on debt servicing and related payments
ISLAMABAD: At least 39 government departments – notably the power and defence divisions – spent more money than they were allocated for the outgoing fiscal year, while around three dozen departments’ funds remained ‘under-utilised’ for various reasons.
Much like last year, the power and defence sectors remained among the biggest spenders, as the former overshot its allocations by Rs129.5bn and the latter by over Rs61bn, under multiple heads.
The defence ministry’s Defence Services Division overspent by nearly Rs59.5bn and the Defence Division spent Rs1.8bn more than the amount set aside for it in the previous budget.
According to budget documents, specifically the voluminous ‘Details of Demands for Grants and Appropriations 2025-26 (Current Expenditure)’ the Defence Division exceeded its allocation under the ‘operating expenses’ and ‘physical assets’ heads. The revised estimate for the ‘physical assets’ rose from Rs730 million to Rs2.5bn.
The Power Division, meanwhile, spent Rs159bn under the ‘investments’ head, even though the budget had not allocated any amount for this purpose. In addition, its operational spending also doubled from Rs215m to Rs466m.
Similarly, the National Health Services division (the secretariat of the federal health ministry) doubled its expenditure in the outgoing year, spending Rs51.9bn against a sanctioned amount of Rs27.8bn – an overrun of over Rs24bn.
One of the main reasons for overshooting its allocated amount were ‘operating expenses’ that rose from Rs13.3bn to Rs35.8bn.
Even though it has failed to meet the revenue target set in the budget, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) spent Rs6.57bn more than allocated. Similarly, Pakistan Post also exceeded its allocation by Rs6bn.
Debt servicing
Though the government managed to save Rs1.77 trillion in terms of foreign debt payments, payments under the head of domestic debt rose by almost Rs2.6tr. Around Rs829bn was also saved in interest payments for domestic debt.
In total, the government spent Rs33.85tr to pay off foreign and domestic debts, and their interest, against an allocation of Rs33.84tr, overrunning by a little over Rs4bn. The government had allocated Rs4.98tr for foreign loans, but spent only Rs3.2tr, saving Rs1.7tr under this head. For debt servicing of foreign loans, it spent Rs1tr.
Similarly, Rs29.5bn was paid under the head of short-term foreign credit payment. On the domestic front, the government exceeded its allocation and paid Rs2.6tr more than the sanctioned amount of Rs19tr to pay off domestic lenders. However, Rs829bn was saved on domestic debt servicing, probably on account of a substantial cut in the policy rate.
Under-utilisation of funds
Besides foreign debt payments, where a substantial chunk of money was saved, the Finance Division ‘saved’ Rs216bn under the category of ‘Grants, Subsidies, and Miscellaneous’. The economic affairs ministry also did not spend Rs7.7bn allocated under the ‘miscellaneous’ head.
This inability to spend also affected welfare initiatives, such as poverty alleviation and the housing sector. The Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division failed to spend over Rs1.64bn from its allocated amount, despite poverty levels rising as the cost of living grew.
The housing sector did not fare much better: the Naya Pakistan Housing Authority left Rs1.1bn untouched, while the Housing and Works Division of the housing ministry could not spend Rs1bn, even though there is a housing crisis in the federal capital.
In total, the amount saved by the government, including the amount saved on foreign debt payment, was approximately Rs2tr, whereas the departments that exceeded their allocations overspent about Rs2.85tr, including the additional Rs2.6tr used to pay off domestic debt.
Cover for ‘overspending’
It is important to note that these numbers do not include the development expenditure of these departments, and the data is based on information available in the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues’ (AGPR) system as of May 16, 2025.
For departments who have overspent, demands for grants will be tabled before the National Assembly under Article 82 for approval during the budget approvals process.
Article 82(1) refers to expenditure, which is charged upon the Federal Consolidated Fund and may be discussed but not put to a vote. All other grants will be decided by the house under Article 82(2).

Nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israeli strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13. Iran subsequently launched its own retaliation with ballistic missiles fired at Israel and the two countries continued to exchange a volley over the weekend.
Posts from multiple Indian and others users on social media platforms and Indian media outlets since Sunday shared a video of Iranian National Security Council member Mohsen Rezaei, claiming that he said Pakistan told Iran that if Israel drops a nuclear bomb on Tehran, Pakistan would retaliate in kind amid current tensions. However, fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan concluded that the video was doctored, and the Iranian official had not made any such statement.
Addressing the matter during today’s Senate session, FM Dar said, “There is a video on social media where an Iranian general was quoted as saying: ‘If Israel nuke attacks Iran, then Pakistan will attack [Israel] with nuclear weapons.’”
“This is irresponsible and false news,” he said, adding that the claims had become viral on the internet, and that even UK news outlet Daily Mail picked it up.
He said, “From our side, there has been no such statement. It was fabricated.”
 
 

He also addressed an alleged video of US President Donald Trump allegedly urging Pakistan to stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. Similarly, he said that a widely circulated interview of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, purported to be recent, was in fact from 2011. Such deceptive content is causing confusion and is being monitored closely by the Foreign Office, he told the Senate.
Dar said, “We have checked that it was an AI-generated clip and it was fake.”
He cautioned that everyone must be careful, saying, “This is not a children’s matter. This is a serious war like ours with India.”
 






Speaking on the Iran-Israel conflict, the foreign minister said, “We wanted the Iran-US [nuclear] talks to be successful. I must appreciate the foreign minister of Oman and Iran, who kept me in the loop throughout the process of the four rounds of talks in Muscat and Rome.”
Dar said that the Senate’s statement on the conflict was widely circulated around the world, stating, “[The] House of Federation took a strong stance. We fulfilled our responsibility with clarity.”
He further said that Pakistan facilitated the UN Security Council meeting within 24 hours of the attacks. He added that the Iranian ambassador at the meeting acknowledged four countries by name, including Pakistan.
Dar also said that he spoke to the Iranian foreign minister on the night of June 13/14, quoting him as saying, “We [Iran] are ready for diplomatic dialogue if Israel does not attack again.”
“We have conveyed the matter through different channels that Iran is ready if the other side can stop,” he added.
He highlighted some of the consequences for Pakistani students and zaireen (pilgrims) in Iran.
“On June 13, the crisis management unit of the foreign ministry was activated.
“We have so far evacuated 251 students. By tonight, they will reach Quetta. There are over 500 zaireen there. Three hundred of them travelled by air to go there while 209 went there by road,” he said, adding that Pakistan was in contact with other countries as well.
“Iran approached us on June 14 to help bring back 20,000 Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. We gave a positive response to this. Pakistan will give them a visa on arrival, and welcome them at Karachi airport … So we are fulfilling our responsibility.”
Dar also spoke on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, saying that Pakistan’s policy had not changed since 1998.
“Even at that time, we said that it is Pakistan’s stated policy. It is for the purpose of self-defence. It is our deterrence. It was important for parity, peace and security in this region,” he said, adding that India’s “spectacle of having hegemony and supremacy over us [Pakistan]” was buried on May 10, following the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
Dar further said, “We are not signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since 1998, our condition has been that we will sign it only when India does. So neither India nor Pakistan have signed it. Neither has Israel. But it is a serious crime to attack nuclear installations, whether you are a member or not.
“It is a major violation of international law due to the unimaginable consequences of attacking nuclear facilities.
The foreign minister reiterated that Pakistan’s “nuclear power is for our security and stability as well as regional stability.
“Israel dare not look at Pakistan. Pakistan has enough power to respond to any malafide [action]. Our armed forces are fully alert,” he added.
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the global community to be “wary and apprehensive” of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, amidst Tel Aviv’s aggression against its neighbours in the region.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and starving a besieged population — Israel has now expanded its assault across borders, launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
 






“(The) world should be wary and apprehensive about Israel’s nuclear prowess, a country not bound by any international nuclear discipline, nor signatory to NPT or any other binding arrangement,” he said in a post on X.
“We do not pursue hegemonic policies against our neighbours, which are being amply demonstrated by Israel these days,” Asif continued, referring to Israel’s aggression in the region,.
The defence minister added that Pakistan was a signatory to all international nuclear disciplines.
“Our nuclear capability is for the benefit of our people and defence of our country against the hostile designs of our enemies,” Asif said.
Asif said that the Western world must worry about conflicts being generated by Israel, adding that it would engulf the whole region and beyond.
“Their patronage of Israel, a rogue state, can have catastrophic consequences,” Asif warned.
Israel was able to produce nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s. It is estimated that there are about 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads in this country and that Israel has produced enough plutonium for 100-200 weapons.
Tel Aviv is not a party to the NPT — a 1970 accord aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament, and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
 
 

“Although Israel refrains from informing the international community about whether it possesses nuclear weapons, it is the only country in the Middle East that has not accepted the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which allows the IAEA to inspect all kinds of civilian and military nuclear facilities and to carry out verification activities for the work carried out,” Heinz Gartner, a professor from the University of the Vienna told Anadolu Agency.
Pakistan is also not a signatory to the NPT but frequently reiterates its commitment to nuclear safety and non-proliferation principles through other international frameworks.</p><small>2025-06-17 00:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1617411158494ce.jpg?r=190007' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917503/fm-dar-rubbishes-fake-fabricated-video-of-iranian-official-about-pakistan-attacking-israel-with-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar rubbishes ‘fake, fabricated’ video of Iranian official about Pakistan attacking Israel with nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday dismissed an alleged video circulating online of an Iranian official saying Pakistan will attack Israel with nuclear weapons, amid the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel.

The foreign minister reiterated that Pakistan’s “nuclear power is for our security and stability as well as regional stability.
“Israel dare not look at Pakistan. Pakistan has enough power to respond to any malafide [action]. Our armed forces are fully alert,” he added.
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the global community to be “wary and apprehensive” of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, amidst Tel Aviv’s aggression against its neighbours in the region.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and starving a besieged population — Israel has now expanded its assault across borders, launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
 






“(The) world should be wary and apprehensive about Israel’s nuclear prowess, a country not bound by any international nuclear discipline, nor signatory to NPT or any other binding arrangement,” he said in a post on X.
“We do not pursue hegemonic policies against our neighbours, which are being amply demonstrated by Israel these days,” Asif continued, referring to Israel’s aggression in the region,.
The defence minister added that Pakistan was a signatory to all international nuclear disciplines.
“Our nuclear capability is for the benefit of our people and defence of our country against the hostile designs of our enemies,” Asif said.
Asif said that the Western world must worry about conflicts being generated by Israel, adding that it would engulf the whole region and beyond.
“Their patronage of Israel, a rogue state, can have catastrophic consequences,” Asif warned.
Israel was able to produce nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s. It is estimated that there are about 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads in this country and that Israel has produced enough plutonium for 100-200 weapons.
Tel Aviv is not a party to the NPT — a 1970 accord aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament, and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
 
 

“Although Israel refrains from informing the international community about whether it possesses nuclear weapons, it is the only country in the Middle East that has not accepted the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which allows the IAEA to inspect all kinds of civilian and military nuclear facilities and to carry out verification activities for the work carried out,” Heinz Gartner, a professor from the University of the Vienna told Anadolu Agency.
Pakistan is also not a signatory to the NPT but frequently reiterates its commitment to nuclear safety and non-proliferation principles through other international frameworks.</p><small>2025-06-17 00:24</small></div><hr>
