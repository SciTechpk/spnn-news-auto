Last night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.
Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that Fitna-al-Hindu­stan  — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.
The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.
Assistant Comm­issioner (AC) Naveed Alam told Dawn.com today that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.
He said that seven of the passengers had been identified, but two could not be due to a lack of documents.
“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam said.
Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each was a resident of DG Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.
Leaders condemn tragedy, vow action
The country’s top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators “at all costs”.
In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: “This barbarity is part of Fitna-al-Hindustan’s evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,” state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He reaffirmed commitment to “clear the land of Fitna-al-Hindustan and its facilitators at all costs”.
Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: “We will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.”
The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by Fitna-al-Hindustan.
“With resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,” the prime minister said.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it “blatant terrorism”.
“The killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,” Bugti said, vowing that the response would be “severe”.
“The terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,” he said, adding that the state “would not even let these murderers hide underground”.
The chief minister added: “All networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of Fitna-al-Hindustan will be destroyed.”
Noting that this was a “state war”, he vowed decisive action.
CM Bugti further vowed to crush “every plan of terrorism” with strength, determination and unity. “Balochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.”
In a statement on X late last night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident, saying: “We will chase and eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists who target innocent passengers.”
“The conspiracies of Indian-sponsored terrorists and their accomplices must be foiled with the support of the nation.”
 






According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.
The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.
“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”
After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.
Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.
According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.
CM reviews law and order situation
CM Bugti presided over a high-level security meeting to assess the province’s overall law and order situation.
Inspector General of Police Balochistan Moazzam Jah Ansari and other senior security officials were in attendance. They presented comprehensive briefings outlining the motives behind the attack, progress in the investigation and steps taken by law enforcement in its aftermath.
Bugti vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice swiftly.
“We will not spare anyone involved in this heinous act,” he declared. “There will be no leniency for those who shed innocent blood.”
CM Bugti emphasised the need for seamless coordination between police and Levies forces, instructing that jurisdictional boundaries must not hinder operations. “A united and effective response is imperative to ensure such elements never re-emerge,” he said.
He also directed the strengthening of rapid response capabilities to better manage future threats.
“There will be no compromise on the rule of law. We will meet the enemies of peace with full force.”
‘Get rid of miscreants’, brother of slain passengers demands
One of the surviving passengers, Sabir Toor, told Geo News that he and 10 members of his family were on their way to Lodhran from Quetta for their father’s funeral when the attack occurred.
The gunmen offloaded his two brothers, Usman and Jabir, from the bus in front of women and children of the family and killed them. “I cannot describe this hour of grief — we have three funerals in the family now.”
“I urge security forces to get rid of these miscreants,” he said, adding that he and his brothers had been working in Quetta for the past 30 years and had no relations to any political party.
Violence against common citizens deplorable: HRCP
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep grievance over the incident, urging the state to seek a “political solution” to long-standing issues in Balochistan.
In a statement posted on X, the HRCP said, “This wanton violence against labourers and common citizens is deplorable and must cease immediately.”
 






In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan.
Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.
In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.
In May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p><small>2025-07-11 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1122163007ea705.jpg?r=222739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923552/paris-prosecutors-ask-police-to-join-investigation-of-musks-x' target='_blank'><strong>Paris prosecutors ask police to join investigation of Musk’s X</strong></a><br><p>A French probe into Elon Musk’s social media platform X deepened on Friday, when the Paris prosecutor’s office said it had enlisted police to investigate suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction by the company or its executives.
The move adds to the pressure on Musk, a former ally of US President Donald Trump who has accused European governments of attacking free speech and has also voiced support for some of the region’s far-right parties.
French police could conduct searches, wiretaps and surveillance against Musk and X executives, or summon them to testify. If they do not comply, a judge could issue an international arrest warrant.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Paris prosecutors launched a preliminary probe in January, after receiving complaints of alleged foreign interference by X from a lawmaker and a senior French official, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.
On July 9, after preliminary findings provided by researchers and French public institutions, they asked police to investigate X “as both a legal entity and through individual persons”.
The alleged crimes are “organised interference with the functioning of an automated data processing system” and “organised fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system”.
 
 

Paris prosecutors’ latest investigation of powerful tech figures may deepen a rift between Washington and European capitals over what sort of discourse is permitted online.
Pavel Durov, the Russian-born founder of the Telegram messaging app, is under judicial supervision in France after being arrested last year and placed under formal investigation for alleged organised crime on the app. He denies guilt.
Durov’s arrest, which Musk criticised, ignited a debate about free speech that has been taken up by senior Trump officials.
Musk has used X to personally support right-wing parties and causes in France, Germany and Britain. After months in lockstep with Trump, he recently broke with the president over his federal budget, and he is now launching his own political party.</p><small>2025-07-11 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/112134244b26740.jpg?r=220927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923551/judicial-top-brass-forms-body-to-devise-institutional-response-to-enforced-disappearances' target='_blank'><strong>Judicial top brass forms body to devise ‘institutional response’ to enforced disappearances</strong></a><br><p>The National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) constituted a “dedicated committee” on Friday to devise an institutional response to the emotive and chronic issue of enforced disappearances in the country.
The NJPMC was set up under an ordinance in 2002 to coordinate and harmonise judicial policy within the court system and in coordination with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP). The committee also makes recommendations for bringing about an improvement in the capacity and performance of the administration of justice, setting performance standards for judicial officers and persons associated with performance of judicial and quasi-judicial functions, improvement in the terms and conditions of service of judicial officers, court staff and to ensure skilled and efficient judiciary.
A press release issued today from the Supreme Court said the committee’s 53rd meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and attended by the high court chief justices, as well as Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan.
The members deliberated on “key policy issues and adopted several significant measures to improve judicial performance, technology integration in judicial processes and citizen-centric justice delivery”.
Among those measures was taking “serious notice of the enforced disappearances” and unanimously resolving that the judiciary “would not compromise on its constitutional duty to safeguard fundamental rights”.
The press release said a dedicated committee was constituted to formulate an institutional response, after taking into consideration the concerns of the executive, to be communicated through AGP Awan.
The detailed decisions of the meeting said: “The NJPMC strongly condemned enforced disappearances and unanimously resolved that the judiciary will neither compromise on its constitutional mandate, nor shall it fall prey to expediencies when it comes to safeguarding fundamental liberties, particularly in matters as grave as enforced disappearances.”
The committee constituted to devise the institutional response would include the director general and senior director (academics) of the Federal Judicial Academy, and the secretary of the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP).
AGP Awam would communicate all concerns of the government to the committee with plausible legal options for consideration and review, after which the committee would submit its report to the NJPMC within 30 days.
 
 

A total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances in the first half of 2025, it emerged on Wednesday.
The commission was set up in 2011 to trace missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible for their disappearance.
In the month of June alone, a total of 27 missing persons cases were received nationwide, while 33 cases were disposed of.
The commission offered a monthly breakdown of the cases received and disposed; 26 cases were received in January and 209 disposed of; 12 new cases in February and 104 disposed of; 30 were received in March and 34 disposed of; 11 were reported in April and 42 disposed of; 19 were received in May and 62 disposed of.
The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
A total of 4,771 missing persons have returned home, according to the report, while 1,017 people are being held in internment centres and 705 in prisons.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament holds the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.
CJP Afridi had said in May that “there should be a closure of this issue for all times to come”.
Tackling external influence
Regarding the issue of external influence in the judiciary, the press release said: “The committee also decided to protect judicial officers from external influence and asked the high courts to establish structured mechanisms for reporting and redressal of such instances within a stipulated timeframe.”
The detailed decisions that on the agenda item of “institutional response to extraneous influence on judges of district judiciary”, the NJPMC “unanimously decided that there must be some reporting and redressal mechanism in place for judicial officers against external influence by executive functionaries/organisations”.
It was decided that the high courts would develop a reporting and redressal mechanism in this regard, within 30 days, under intimation to LJCP.
The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is expected to meet on July 12 to consider a number of pending issues. It is also expected to resume consideration of a letter by six judges alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.
The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.
The letter had earlier prompted then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had recused himself from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that “inaction by Islamabad High Court chief justice or judges” should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.</p><small>2025-07-11 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/112052599716fc7.jpg?r=205851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923545/policeman-shot-dead-rangers-man-injured-in-scuffle-over-personal-grudge-police' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman shot dead, Rangers man injured in scuffle over ‘personal grudge’: police</strong></a><br><p>A policeman was shot dead while a Rangers man was shot at and hurt as they scuffled over a “personal grudge” in Karachi’s Site area on Friday, according to police.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza said, “The police constable Waseem Ahmed Abro, 30, posted at Gulshan-i-Maymar police was shot dead allegedly by Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman, while he (Noman) was also shot in the foot by the deceased constable.”
“Initially, the injured Rangers sepoy claimed that the policeman was engaged in a roadside robbery with a passerby, but later on, it transpired that the incident was an outcome of some ‘personal grudge’ between them,” he added.
The DIG said during the initial probe, it transpired that both the deceased and the injured, dressed in civvies and riding separate motorcycles, reached the crime scene near Habib Bank Chowk in Site at around 10:45am.
Quoting witnesses, the senior officer said that after an exchange of abusive language and a scuffle, they fired upon each other. As a result, policeman Waseem sustained two bullet wounds on his abdomen and right forefinger and died on the spot.
While the Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman posted at 34 Wing sustained a bullet wound to his thigh.
“The police immediately responded and shifted the deceased to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital,” the DIG added.
One 9mm pistol bearing number 193 MFAC (empty) and one 9mm pistol without a number, along with eight rounds and two motorcycles, both without number plates as per Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) record, were confiscated.
“The injured Rangers man on his own reached the Rangers Hospital in North Nazimabad,” the official said.
“The Crime Scene Unit, along with investigation officials, also reached the spot and seized material evidence from the crime scene.”
Senior Superintendent of Police Keamari retired captain Faizan Ali also visited the crime scene. The CCTV footage near the crime scene has been collected and examined.
“The state of affairs and CCTV footage confirmed that constable Waseem Ahmed and Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman fired upon each other on a personal grudge,” said the DIG South.
“It was not an incident of robbery or other crime, added the senior officer. “We are registering a first information report on the complaint of the father of the slain police official, who is also a sub-inspector at Landhi police station,” said the DIG.
The DIG said the injured paramilitary officer was “stable” and in Rangers custody.
The official further said the initial investigation suggests that the personal grudge between the policeman and the Rangers sepoy could have been over a woman.
Last year in May, A man, abducted by the Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department soon after his return from Iraq a couple of days ago, was recovered, and three policemen were arrested in a Rangers raid on the premises of the CTD’s Civil Lines office.
The Rangers’ action had caused the Sindh police a major embarrassment and led to the sacking of at least three officials from their posts.
In December of last year, the Sindh government extended the deployment of Rangers in Karachi for a period of one year.</p><small>2025-07-11 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/112043134093f6e.jpg?r=205429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923544/us-state-department-starts-firing-over-1350-workers-in-trumps-shake-up-of-diplomatic-corps' target='_blank'><strong>US State Department starts firing over 1,350 workers in Trump’s shake-up of diplomatic corps</strong></a><br><p>The US State Department began firing more than 1,350 local employees on Friday as the administration of President Donald Trump presses ahead with an unprecedented overhaul of its diplomatic corps, a move critics say will undermine Washington’s ability to defend and promote its interests abroad.
The layoffs will cover 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service officers based in the United States, according to an internal State Department notice sent to the workforce and seen by Reuters.
“The department is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,” the notice said. “Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found,” it added.
The total reduction in the workforce will be around 3,000, including voluntary departures, out of the 18,000 employees based in the US, according to the notice and a senior State Department official.
The move is the first step of a restructuring that Trump has sought to ensure US foreign policy is aligned with his “America First” agenda. Former diplomats and critics say the firing of foreign service officers risks America’s ability to counter the growing assertiveness from adversaries such as China and Russia.
“President Trump and Secretary of State [Marco] Rubio are once again making America less safe and less secure,” Democratic Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia said in a statement.
“This is one of the most ridiculous decisions that could possibly be made at a time when China is increasing its diplomatic footprint around the world and establishing an overseas network of military and transportation bases, Russia is continuing its years-long brutal assault of a sovereign country, and the Middle East is careening from crisis to crisis,” Kaine said.
Trump in February ordered Rubio to revamp the foreign service to ensure that the Republican president’s foreign policy is “faithfully” implemented.
He has also repeatedly pledged to “clean out the deep state” by firing bureaucrats whom he deems disloyal. The shake-up is part of an unprecedented push by Trump to shrink the federal bureaucracy and cut what he says is wasteful spending of taxpayer money.
‘Bloated’
Rubio announced the plans for the shake-up in April, saying the State Department in its current form was “bloated, bureaucratic” and was not able to perform its mission “in this new era of great power competition”.
He envisioned a structure that he said would give back the power to regional bureaus and embassies and get rid of programmes and offices that do not align with America’s core interests.
That vision would see the elimination of the role of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.
The reorganisation had been expected to be largely concluded by July 1, but did not proceed as planned amid ongoing litigation, as the State Department waited for the US Supreme Court to weigh in on the Trump administration’s bid to halt a judicial order blocking mass job cuts.
On Tuesday, the court cleared the way for the Trump administration to pursue the job cuts and the sweeping downsizing of numerous agencies. Since then, the White House Counsel’s Office and the Office of Personnel Management have been coordinating with federal agencies to ensure their plans comply with the law.
Last week, more than 130 retired diplomats and other former senior US officials issued an open letter criticising the planned overhaul.</p><small>2025-07-11 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11190926aeb658f.jpg?r=191056' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923530/police-conduct-probe-as-unidentified-attackers-booked-for-anp-leader-maulana-khan-zebs-murder' target='_blank'><strong>Police conduct probe as unidentified attackers booked for ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb’s murder</strong></a><br><p>A first information report (FIR) was registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur area against unidentified attackers involved in the assassination of Awami National Party (ANP) leader Maulana Khan Zeb, it emerged on Friday.
The ANP leader was shot dead on Thursday by unidentified assailants in KP’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed and three other people were injured in the attack.
According to a copy of the FIR — dated July 10 and seen by Dawn.com — the unidentified attackers were booked under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempted murder) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The FIR states that Khan Zeb was returning home from campaigning for the July 13 peace parade when his vehicle was attacked by the unidentified gunmen, resulting in his death and that of a police constable.
Meanwhile, the Bajaur DPO confirmed new updates in the investigation to Dawn.com, according to which the geo-fencing of two locations is underway and that forensic evidence was collected from the crime scene.
“According to eyewitnesses, five suspects riding on two motorcycles fired on the vehicle,” DPO Rafiq confirmed, citing a police report. “Maulana Khan Zeb was the target of the attack.
“Two locations are being geofenced and 35 bullet casings were recovered from the crime scene,” Rafiq said, adding that the initial complaint was registered by the station house officer at Khar Police Station.
The assassination was condemned by politicians in KP and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The ANP itself declared three days of mourning and suspended political activities.</p><small>2025-07-11 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/111859119b1538f.jpg?r=190150' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923528/afp-news-agency-to-reduce-headcount-foreign-network-costs' target='_blank'><strong>AFP news agency to reduce headcount, foreign network costs</strong></a><br><p>The chairman of Agence France-Presse (AFP) outlined his plans on Friday to cut costs at the news agency with a retirement incentive scheme and a reduction in spending on expatriate journalists.
Fabrice Fries warned last month that the group needed to save 12-14 million euros ($13.8-16.1m) by the end of 2026 due to a fall in revenues.
Speaking to employee representatives on today, he said he hoped to save 4-5m euros a year with a retirement incentive plan in which 50-70 employees would leave and not be replaced.
Costs linked to AFP’s foreign network of journalists would also be cut by around 3m euros a year, or around 10 per cent of the total, he said.
This would be achieved by reducing the number of jobs with expatriate conditions, which typically include housing benefits and school fees.
“AFP is committed to expatriation,” Fries said — but “not at any price”.
An experienced journalist working in Germany on expatriate conditions costs the same as four locally employed early-career reporters, he added.
Funding the cost-saving measures would require “external financing”, he said. That could mean taking a loan from the French state, rescheduling existing debt payments or a bank loan.
AFP, one of the world’s biggest news agencies with 2,600 staff worldwide, has been affected by an ongoing global downturn in the media industry as well as several short-term factors.
Fears about a global recession have led many clients to enter “wait-and-see mode” and either delay investment decisions or reduce their budgets, Fries explained last month.
Funding cuts from the United States government under President Donald Trump have also hit AFP clients. Some of them, such as Voice of America, have been forced to cancel their subscriptions.
Social network giant Facebook has also terminated its fact-checking programme in the US, for which AFP was an important paid partner.
After seven years of growth, AFP’s revenues are set to fall this year to around 8m euros less than forecast in the budget, according to management.
AFP is one of the world’s three major general news agencies, alongside US-based Associated Press and Canadian-owned Reuters.
It produces news stories, photos, videos and graphics for media companies around the world in six languages.
Alongside its commercial income, the agency also receives funding from the French state, which amounted to 118.9m euros in 2024.</p><small>2025-07-11 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/111828367353ed6.jpg?r=195940' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923526/bosnia-commemorates-srebrenica-genocide-30-years-on' target='_blank'><strong>Bosnia commemorates Srebrenica genocide 30 years on</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of mourners on Friday commemorated in Srebrenica the genocide committed 30 years ago by Bosnian Serb forces, one of Europe’s worst atrocities since World War II.
The remains of seven victims were laid to rest during the commemorations, which mark the bloodiest episode of Bosnia’s inter-ethnic war in the 1990s.
They included those of Sejdalija Alic, one of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys killed by Bosnian Serb forces after they captured the eastern town on July 11, 1995.
His granddaughter Anela Alic, whose father was also killed in the massacre and was buried earlier, came to attend the funeral.
“I never saw my father … and today, my grandfather is being buried, just some of his bones, next to his son.
“It’s a deep sadness… I have no words to describe it,” the 32-year-old added, in tears. She was born in early 1994 after her pregnant mother was evacuated in a Red Cross convoy from the ill-fated town.
The victims of Srebrenica, which was at the time a UN-protected enclave, were buried in mass graves. So far, about 7,000 victims have been identified and buried, while about 1,000 are still missing.
In a bid to cover up the crime, the Bosnian Serb forces had the remains removed to secondary mass graves, causing many of the bodies to be shredded by heavy machinery, according to experts.
‘Tombstone to caress’
“For 30 years we have carried the pain in our souls,” said Munira Subasic, president of the association Mothers of Srebrenica. She lost her husband, Hilmo and 17-year-old son, Nermin, in the massacre.
“Our children were killed, innocent, in the UN-protected zone. Europe and the world watched in silence as our children were killed.”
The seven victims buried under white tombstones on Friday at the memorial centre after a joint prayer included a 19-year-old man and a 67-year-old woman.
The remains of most of the victims are incomplete and in some cases consist only of one or two bones, experts said. Families have waited for years to bury their loved ones, hoping that more remains would be found.
But Mevlida Omerovic decided not to wait any longer to bury her husband, Hasib. He was killed at the age of 33, at one of five mass-execution sites of the massacre, the only atrocity of Bosnia’s 1992-1995 war, which was qualified as genocide by international justice institutions.
“Thirty years have passed and I have nothing to wait for anymore,” said Omerovic, 55. She wants to be able to visit the grave of her husband, even though only his jawbone will be in the coffin.
By visiting the graves, the victims’ relatives try to find some comfort.
“I have only this tombstone to caress, to pray next to it,” said Sefika Mustafi, standing next to the graves of her sons Enis and Salim, who were both teenagers when killed. “I’d like to dream about them, but it doesn’t work. I’ve said thousands of times, ‘Come my children, Come into my dream’ … I say it when I pray, when I come here, but it doesn’t work.”
Serb denial
Canadian veteran Daniel Chenard, deployed with UN peacekeepers to Bosnia from October 1993 until March 1994, when the Dutch troops took over, attended commemorations haunted by the feeling of guilt for decades.
“I forgave myself … I found peace. I always wanted to tell them (victims’ families): ‘I apologise … I’m sorry for abandoning you’.
“We (UN troops) did what we could … but the tragedy still happened,” the 58-year-old said, in tears.
Bosnian Serb wartime political and military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were sentenced to life imprisonment by an international tribunal, notably for the Srebrenica genocide.
But Serbia and Bosnian Serb leaders continue to deny that the massacre was a genocide.
Last year, an international day of remembrance was established by the United Nations to mark the Srebrenica genocide, despite protests from Belgrade and Bosnian Serbs.
On Friday, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic voiced condolences to the Srebrenica victims’ families on behalf of the citizens of Serbia, calling the massacre a “terrible crime”.
“We cannot change the past, but we must change the future,” he posted on X.

The top US diplomat was in Malaysia on his first Asia trip since taking office, seeking to stress US commitment to the region at the East Asia Summit and the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), where many countries were reeling from a raft of steep US tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump this week.
Rubio had his first in-person talks with the Chinese foreign minister, which came after Beijing warned the US against reinstating hefty levies on its goods next month and threatened retaliation against nations that strike deals with the US to cut China out of supply chains.
Wang has sharply criticised Washington during talks with Asian counterparts in Malaysia, calling the US tariffs “typical unilateral bullying behaviour”.
But both sides described the bilateral meeting as positive and constructive and Rubio said the odds of Trump meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping were high.
“We’re two big, powerful countries, and there are always going to be issues that we disagree on. I think there’s some areas of potential cooperation and I thought it was a very constructive, positive meeting, and a lot of work to do,” he told reporters.
Rubio emphasised that his sitting down with Wang was not a negotiation, but rather about establishing a constructive baseline to continue talks.
Asked about a possible Trump-Xi meeting, Rubio said both sides wanted to see it happen.
“We have to build the right atmosphere and build … deliverables, so that a visit isn’t just a visit, but it actually has some takeaways from it that are concrete. But there’s a strong desire on both sides to do it.”
China’s foreign ministry said Wang had emphasised that both countries should translate consensus reached by their leaders into policies and actions.
“Both sides agreed that the meeting was positive, pragmatic and constructive,” it said.
Trip overshadowed by tariffs
Rubio’s visit is part of an effort to renew the US focus on the Indo-Pacific region and look beyond conflicts in the Middle East and Europe that have consumed much of the administration’s attention since Trump’s return to office in January.
But that has been overshadowed by this week’s announcement of steep US tariffs on imports from many Asian countries and US allies, including 25 per cent targeting Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, 32pc for Indonesia, 36pc for Thailand and Cambodia and 40pc on goods from Myanmar and Laos.
 
 

China, initially singled out with levies exceeding 100pc, has until August 12 to reach a deal with Washington to avoid Trump’s reinstating additional import curbs that were imposed during tit-for-tat tariff exchanges in April and May.
Analysts said Rubio would use the trip to press the case that the US remains a better partner than China, Washington’s main strategic rival. Rubio met his counterparts from Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia today.
Wang has rebuked the US in Kuala Lumpur, saying no country should support or agree with its tariffs, according to remarks released by Beijing today.
He told Thailand’s foreign minister the tariffs had been abused and “undermined the free trade system, and interfered with the stability of the global production and supply chain”.
During a meeting with his Cambodian counterpart, Wang said the US levies were an attempt to deprive Southeast Asian countries of their legitimate right to development.
“We believe that Southeast Asian countries have the ability to cope with complex situations, adhere to principled positions, and safeguard their own interests,” he said.
In a joint communique today, Asean foreign ministers expressed concern over rising global trade tensions and the need to diversify trade, calling for a transparent and fair multilateral trading system.
Without mentioning the US, they said that unilateral tariffs were “counterproductive and risk exacerbating global economic fragmentation”.
Indispensable partnership
Rubio also met Russia’s Sergei Lavrov on Thursday and said he and Lavrov had shared some ideas on a new or different Russian approach to Ukraine.
“I don’t want to oversell it, okay, but it was constructive,” he said today. “We’ll find out, but there are some things that we will potentially explore, and I relayed that to the president and our team last night.”
Rubio also met Japan’s foreign minister and South Korea’s first vice foreign minister in Malaysia to discuss regional security and a strengthening of their “indispensable trilateral partnership”, the US State Department said in a statement.
Asked about Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s remarks on Thursday that Tokyo needs to wean itself off its dependence on Washington, Rubio said it was not a comment to be viewed negatively.
“We obviously have very strong commitments and an alliance with Japan. We continue to cooperate very closely with them,” he said.</p><small>2025-07-11 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/111855040425364.jpg?r=185552' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923507/fact-check-absar-alam-did-not-advocate-recognition-of-israel-viral-clip-is-incomplete' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Absar Alam did not advocate recognition of Israel; viral clip is incomplete</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platform X on Thursday shared a video clip, claiming it showed journalist Absar Alam urging Pakistan to explore the benefits of recognising Israel. However, the viral clip is incomplete and he is actually questioning whether recognising Israel would bring any real benefits to Pakistan.
The Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States in 2020, are landmark agreements for diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. These accords paved the way for formal ties, such as embassies and trade deals, underpinned by mutual interests in security, economic collaboration, and technology exchange.
While celebrated as a diplomatic shift in the Middle East, the accords also sparked debate and resistance in Pakistan. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif have both affirmed that Pakistan will not join, asserting that any recognition of Israel would contradict its longstanding support for a two‑state solution and could only be considered if it served Pakistan’s national interest.
On Thursday, anchor and YouTuber Tariq Mateen posted a clip of Alam from a Samaa TV podcast, overlaid with a text that read: “Absar Alam has now started listing the benefits of recognising Israel. These people, on their own, have already accepted Israel.”
The transcription of the clip is reproduced below:
“If we recognise Israel, people say there will be benefits like reduced pressure on Balochistan, or that India and Israel might stop collaborating against us. Maybe we’ll get access to technology such as that of agriculture or weaponry. But is there any guarantee of that?
India is also our enemy, and yet we have diplomatic ties with them — cultural exchanges, people-to-people interactions. Has that ever stopped India from supporting the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan)? No. So diplomatic relations don’t necessarily safeguard our geographical or ideological boundaries.
Every country acts in its own self-interest. Right now, if someone visits the Indian High Commission, people dig into their family backgrounds to find out why. Tomorrow, if there’s an Israeli embassy here, people will visit that too. Are we going to start investigating everyone then?
What exactly will we gain from this? I don’t understand. Will America suddenly consider us an ally? Write off our debts? Gift us F-35 fighter jets? What exactly will change?“
The post was viewed by over 100,000 users.
The clip was also shared here by a pro-PTI account with the caption: “The impostor who until yesterday was calling Imran Khan an agent of Israel is today listing the benefits of recognising Israel. That’s exactly why, in Pakistan, he is now referred to as a ‘pen-wielding dog’ — because neither his words nor his voice are truly his own. Like a tape recorder, he merely parrots whatever is fed to him by the military establishment,” gaining 64,000 views.
Other shares of the same claim can be found here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in matters related to the debate around whether Pakistan should recognise Israel or not.
A keyword search for “Absar Alam podcast” on YouTube led to a video posted on Samaa TV’s channel on July 10, 2025, titled: “Abraham Accord 2: Trump & Netanyahu Celebrate | Big Message for Pakistan | Absar Alam Reveals All”.
 


At the seven-minute mark, the host raised the possibility of Pakistan recognising Israel, following in the footsteps of several Arab nations.
Alam explained that Pakistan’s goodwill and relations with Arab countries should not dictate its stance on Israel, noting it wouldn’t be in Pakistan’s national interest to sign the Abraham Accords without ensuring the rights of the Palestinian people.
The viral clip, in which Alam is said to be explaining the supposed benefits of recognising Israel, actually shows him questioning any supposed benefits from recognising Israel and reflects the broader argument he made during the podcast.
“We say we are a nuclear power with missile technology and a proud nation with 250 million people, the second largest Islamic country in the world, the only Islamic nuclear power, then we should at least walk the talk and take a principled stand. If the injustice against Palestinians continues and Gaza’s Muslims continue to be attacked and there is an Israeli embassy here with planes and tourists and officials landing here with meeting then I don’t think it will be a healthy sign.
“The example is given of our many wars with India but this example is not justified. We and India were one country and then separated on ideological grounds. We have a quarrel with them on Kashmir but we had relations with them based on cultural and people-to-people basis. We have cultural, people-to-people and religious ties with Palestine, never with Israel in history.”
He rejected the assumption that diplomatic ties would automatically lead to national security or a strategic advantage, citing Pakistan’s continued tensions with India despite formal diplomatic relations in the past. He also deconstructed the usual arguments given in favour of supporting Israel.
In checking whether Alam had responded to the viral clip, reviewing his X account led to a July 10 post addressing Mateen directly.
“Mr Tariq, if only you had listened to the entire clip before speaking, you would have realised your own dishonesty and inadequacy,” he said.
 






Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows journalist Absar Alam advocating for and extolling the benefits of recognising Israel is misleading.
In the full interview, Alam questions whether recognising Israel would bring any real benefits to Pakistan and deconstructs the traditional arguments proposed about any supposed benefits from a formal establishment of relations.

As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
According to the Foreign Office, Deputy PM Dar is leading the Pakistan delegation at the 32nd ministerial meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Regional Forum (ARF), being held today in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Addressing the Pakistani community in Kuala Lumpur, Dar said on the military side of matters, there was no issue between Pakistan and India as the armed forces had gone back to the mutually decided positions.
However, he added that the defeat inflicted by Pakistan has been difficult for the Indian political leadership to digest.
The Deputy PM said that Pakistan gave a befitting and measured response to Indian aggression. He stated that India seeks to establish hegemony in the region, but Pakistan shattered its pride through its response, according to Radio Pakistan.
“Pakistan believes in peace and in building relationships based on equality, dignity and mutual respect,” Dar added.
He said that sometimes New Delhi says that this is a temporary ceasefire, adding, “Pakistan neither asked for a ceasefire, nor would it.
“Neither did we initiate [hostilities] nor did we aggravate matters, and then, when they asked for a ceasefire, we agreed to it after settling the score.
“Otherwise, we wouldn’t have received a call requesting for a ceasefire at 8:15am, just half an hour after our operation ended at 7:45am, where they (India) said we are ready for a ceasefire,” Dar said.
On Thursday, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said that India was doubling down on its “nefarious agenda” against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a “manifest defeat” in the recent military conflict between the two countries.
Dar meets Malaysian PM, FMs of various countries at ARF
On the sidelines of the 32nd ARF ministerial meeting, Dar met with Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim and the foreign ministers of various countries, according to the FO.
 






At the weekly press briefing, the FO spokesperson said that Dar also met with
Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, Foreign Minister of Australia Senator Penny Wong, Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.
He also met with Foreign Minister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic Thongsavanh Phomvihane, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, EU High Representative and Vice President Kaja Kallas, and the Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.</p><small>2025-07-11 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11172555f42a5c1.png?r=180614' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923519/ndma-expects-moderate-to-heavy-monsoon-rains-in-multiple-parts-of-country' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA expects moderate to heavy monsoon rains in multiple parts of country</strong></a><br><p>The National Emer­gencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disa­ster Management Authority (NDMA) on Friday issued a weather alert warning that moderate to heavy monsoon rains are expected to affect multiple regions of the country for a three-day period commencing from July 13 (Sunday).
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and replenishing water supplies and agriculture. They are crucial to the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The NEOC advised the public to take precautionary measures in anticipation of rains.
The forecast indicates moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan due to intensified moisture inflow from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, coupled with an active westerly wave system.
As a result, substantial rises in river flows are expected — most notably in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla), and Chenab rivers.
The advisory stated that Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages were currently at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma were at medium flood levels.
“Taunsa is also expected to rise to medium flood levels, with low to medium flows likely to persist in Indus river stations throughout the coming week,” the NDMA said.
The Chenab river is expected to reach low flood levels at Marala and Khanki, while low flood levels are also forecasted for the Kabul river at Nowshera.
Rain-induced swelling is anticipated in the Swat and Panjkora rivers, as well as their associated streams and nullahs.
Torrential flows in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur torrents are likely to re-activate with medium to high flows during the upcoming weather spell. In Balochistan, streams and nullahs in north-eastern districts may experience high flows, including Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhel.
Additionally, localised flash flooding is expected in river networks of southern Balochistan districts such as Khuzdar, Awaran, Lasbela, and Qalat. At present, Tarbela Dam is at 74 per cent storage capacity and Mangla Dam is at 44pc according to the forecast.
The NDMA advised residents living near rivers, streams, and nullahs to stay vigilant for sudden surges in water levels, especially during heavy rainfall and nighttime.
“Communities in flood-prone areas should identify safe evacuation routes, secure household items, vehicles, and livestock at elevated locations, and prepare emergency kits with essential supplies, including food, water and medicines sufficient for three to five days,” it said.
“District administration, particularly in northeastern and central Punjab, should prepare de-watering equipment to manage water accumulation due to heavy downpours,” it added.
The NDMA strongly urged the public to remain updated through official flood warnings broadcasted via television, radio, mobile alerts and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile application.
“All citizens are reminded to avoid crossing causeways, low bridges, and flooded roads.”
The NDMA said that it remains in “close coordination with relevant authorities” to monitor the situation and ensure timely dissemination of alerts.
Sindh prepares for monsoon rains
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah convened a high-level meeting to review and enhance preparations for the upcoming monsoon rains, emphasising readiness across all relevant departments and institutions province-wide.
 
 

The meeting, held at the CM House, included provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Nasir Shah, Saeed Ghani, Jam Khan Shoro, Zia Lanjar, Mohammad Bux Mahar and Mohammad Ali Malkani. Also present were Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, provincial secretaries, Chief Metrologist Ameer Hyder, and Disaster Management, Water Board, K Electric, Solid Waste heads and representatives from the Corps-V.
The participants of the meeting observed that the weather forecasts predict a “heat-low” pressure area forming earlier than usual over southern Pakistan, with rainfall expected to be normal to slightly above normal during July and August. Upper Sindh may see a 10pc increase in rainfall, while southern Sindh could experience a rise of 20-30pc.
Flood management remains a priority as the Lower Indus region faces significant risks, with potential flooding from the Indus River and hill torrents.
To combat these challenges, the CM has activated all the concerned departments and organisations to improve drainage systems and pumping stations, ensuring they are operational ahead of the monsoon season.
Ongoing restoration efforts from the 2022 floods focus on critical infrastructure improvements to enhance the region’s resilience against flooding.
The CM was told that the cleaning of drains began on June 20, with the operation set to continue until September 15. All major choking points and culverts have been cleared as part of this effort.
Underpasses, including Tariq road, KPT, Submarine, and Mehran, are being prioritised, while emergency response teams remain on high alert across the city.
It was pointed out that the city faced issues such as inadequate infrastructure to handle over 45 millimetres of rain per hour, with challenges including plastic waste and encroachments blocking drains, particularly in District Korangi.</p><small>2025-07-11 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11171034e00c913.jpg?r=180431' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923514/islamabad-court-suspends-order-banning-youtube-channels-of-matiullah-jan-asad-toor' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court suspends order banning YouTube channels of Matiullah Jan, Asad Toor</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Friday admitted two revision petitions — submitted by journalists Matiuallah Jan and Asad Ali Toor — against the judicial magistrate’s order blocking 27 YouTube channels, suspending the ban for the two petitioners.
An Islamabad court recently ordered YouTube to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas.
On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the owners of these channels would face criminal action.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the two revision appeals and ordered the suspension in a one-page written order for each petition.
According to the order dated today, seen by Dawn.com, the petitioners contended that they were not even given a prior notice and that the ban violated Article 10-A of the Constitution.
“Hence, instant revision petition is admitted for regular hearing,” the order read, suspending the ban for both the petitioners.
The court also issued a notice to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) seeking a response in the next hearing on July 21.
Jan confirmed the development in a post on X and said, “As a result, a request is now being made to the YouTube administration to halt the process of closing these channels.”
 






Toor called the suspension “a big victory” and appreciated the legal team in his post.
Separately, human rights lawyer and petitioners’ counsel Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir confirmed to Dawn.com that the order only applied to the two petitioners. “The others can ideally get the same order if they apply for revisions,” she added.
Reuters quoted Mazari as saying, “Our submission is that the order has no legal basis. It was a one-sided decision without giving [the] defence a chance to be heard.” She also said the magistrate court had no jurisdiction over the matter.
The ban has sparked criticism from various legal and digital rights groups.
The Forum for Di­­gital Rights and Democracy (FDRD) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wed­n­esday condemned the decision,  calling it a “bla­­tant violation” of fundamental rig­hts and an assault on press freedom.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also expressed concern over the ban, stating, “The wholesale blocking of entire channels — rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process — conflates dissent with criminal activity.”
“The constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,” the HRCP said, urging “precise and proportionate” interventions against hate speech.
 
 

On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.
In May, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lifted the ban on X after the platform was inaccessible to users for more than a year. The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.</p><small>2025-07-11 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11164045d770a3a.jpg?r=164912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515/mqm-founder-altaf-hussain-hospitalised-in-london-after-severe-illness' target='_blank'><strong>MQM founder Altaf Hussain hospitalised in London after ‘severe illness’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain is currently hospitalised in London due to “severe illness”, according to party officials.
Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.
“The founder and leader of MQM, Altaf Hussain, has been admitted to a hospital in London due to severe illness, where various tests have been conducted on him,” said senior London-based MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi.
He appealed to people to pray for the MQM founder.
 






In a subsequent video message, he said Hussain’s health deteriorated last night and he was hospitalised upon a doctor’s inspection and recommendation. “Doctors have conducted various tests and are focusing their attention on his treatment.”
In a follow-up conversation with Dawn.com, Azizabadi said the MQM founder’s treatment was ongoing and “hopefully it’s not something serious”.
Meanwhile, an update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors had recommended various tests, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, computed tomography scan, X-ray and ultrasound.
“Altaf Hussain has been facing prolonged stress due to the national and international situation, multiple legal cases in London, and severe financial difficulties.
“Suffering from severe mental stress, doctors have prescribed blood transfusion in addition to medications for their treatment, and blood has been transfused.”
 






He was in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
 
 

Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.
His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).
Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third largest party in the country.
In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.
Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.
In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.
After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.
The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p><small>2025-07-11 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1118143491a5212.jpg?r=181924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923520/pakistan-book-place-in-hockey-u-18-asia-cup-final-with-4-3-victory-over-malaysia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan book place in Hockey U-18 Asia Cup final with 4-3 victory over Malaysia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday secured their place in the finals of the U-18 Asia Cup in Dazhou, China with a penalty shootout victory over Malaysia, extending their unbeaten streak in the tournament.

Established by the then-Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme in 1989 and observed on July 11 every year, World Population Day seeks to focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues, including their relations to the environment and development.
The president, in his message to the nation, said that the challenge of population growth continued to hinder the country’s national development process which necessitated a comprehensive, and inclusive approach, state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“When community leaders, elders, and civil society organisations promote the benefits of responsible parenthood and support access to family planning, societal attitudes begin to change. The media also has a central role to play in raising awareness and promoting healthy practices, and can significantly influence public behaviour,” he said.
The president said that this year’s theme — which was to empower young people to create the families they want in a fair and hopeful world — captured the essence of Pakistan’s demographic reality.
“With our population exceeding 242 million, the urgency to adopt forward-looking, evidence-based population policies has never been greater than it is at present. We have a huge youth bulge — our greatest strength, if nurtured through access to education, healthcare, opportunities, and agency.”
Highlighting the pressure of population growth on the country’s national resources, health and education infrastructure, and public services, he said that the rising unemployment, environmental degradation, deforestation, and overstretched health and education systems were symptoms of the imbalance between population size and available resources.
President Zardari called to expand access to quality family planning services, particularly in rural areas, with a focus on women’s education and employment who should be given equal opportunities, as their empowerment directly influences family choices.
He also called for the government to enhance its focus on a comprehensive population agenda, guided by the principle of tawazun (balance) — achieving harmony between population growth and resource availability.
“This approach is supported by stakeholders across sectors, including religious leaders, policymakers, and development partners. It reflects our shared commitment to securing a healthier, more equitable, and resource-efficient future.”
He also stressed the need for adopting international best practices including integrating family planning into primary healthcare systems, promoting reproductive health through community-based outreach, deploying trained female health workers at the grassroots level, and using mass media to promote public education and behavioural change.
“Such strategies can help stabilise population growth,” he added.
Pakistan’s youth can become a dynamic force: PM
In his message, PM Shehbaz said that his government was fully committed to a comprehensive, rights-based population agenda with a focus on equitable access to healthcare, informed family planning, and strengthening systems allowing individuals to make choices about their future with dignity and autonomy, according to APP.
“These efforts are fully aligned with Pakistan’s commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and Family Planning 2030 targets. The stability of population growth requires a coherent, multi-sectoral approach,” he said.
“With a population of 242 million, approximately 65 per cent of whom are under the age of 30, Pakistan stands at a critical juncture in its history. This huge youth population represents both an extraordinary opportunity and a significant challenge,” he remarked.
PM Shehbaz said that Pakistan’s young population could become a dynamic force driving innovation, productivity, and national development if attention was given to their good upbringing and empowerment.
“However, managing such a large and growing population also places immense pressure on public resources and governance systems,” he added.
He urged all stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments, development partners, civil society, the private sector, religious leaders, and local communities, to fulfil their shared responsibility and commitment to address these population challenges and build a healthier, more prosperous future for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-11 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11145210256f488.jpg?r=155829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923506/5-dead-4-injured-as-vehicle-plunges-into-ravine-in-kps-kurram-police' target='_blank'><strong>5 dead, 4 injured as vehicle plunges into ravine in KP’s Kurram: police</strong></a><br><p>At least five people died and four others were injured when a pickup vehicle plunged into a deep gorge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Friday morning, police said.
Kurram Deputy Commissioner Ashfaq Khan told Dawn.com: “The accident occurred in the Para Chamkani Gondal, where five people died and four others sustained injuries.”
He said the vehicle was on its way to Sadda Bazaar Lower Kurram from Spin Ghar Manro when the incident occurred.
“The vehicle lost control on a narrow and dangerous bend and fell off the road, as a result of which five people died on the spot while four were seriously injured,” he added.
The deceased were identified as Gul Wali, son of Abdul Hanan (driver); Naimatullah, son of Gul Khan; Naseeb, son of Hamad Jan, residents of Manro; Dolly Khan, son of Islam; and Riazuddin, son of Zahiruddin, residents of Kimal Baza Zangi.
According to the deputy commissioner, locals voluntarily started relief operations to rescue the injured and recover the bodies soon after the incident.
The injured were immediately taken to the Sadda Hospital with the help of locals, where the condition of some of the injured is said to be critical, he said.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
A day earlier, at least five people were killed in a collision between a car and a truck on Chashma Road in Dera Ismail Khan district, rescue officials said.
Eight members of a family died on May 1 when a Rawalpindi-bound car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of Lower Kohistan district, police said.
At least 10 people died and nine others were injured on April 15 when a speeding trailer ran over a Peshawar-bound van on the Indus highway in KP’s Karak district.

Al Nahyan’s statement came during a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is currently on an official visit to the UAE. The visit aims to strengthen bilateral cooperation in security, counter-narcotics, and immigration matters.
The minister received a warm welcome at the UAE Ministry of Interior, where he was presented with a guard of honour. He was introduced to senior UAE officials and engaged in high-level discussions focusing on visa facilitation for Pakistani citizens, especially work visas.
 






During the visit, Naqvi emphasised the importance of easing the visa policy, stating, “We want Pakistani citizens to come to the UAE with ease. Relaxation in visa policies will bring great relief.”
The UAE interior minister assured full support in this regard.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to expanding cooperation in key areas, including security, anti-smuggling efforts, and the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to tackle emerging security challenges.
 
 

Naqvi also toured the modern policing and operations centre of the Abu Dhabi police, where he was briefed on the city’s advanced surveillance and crime-prevention systems. He praised the technological innovations and expressed interest in adopting similar systems in Pakistan.
The minister concluded his visit by calling the brotherly relations between the UAE and Pakistan a “national asset”, and expressed Pakistan’s desire to deepen cooperation in all areas, particularly security and public welfare, APP reported.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties.

In May, Pakistan and Russia had agreed to revive PSM, which ceased its operations in 2015, according to a press release by the Press Information Department (PID). In 2024, following the official closure of the mill, Sindh sought Russia’s assistance in restoring the ageing infrastructure, which had been incurring losses for decades.
The agreement to revive the defunct entity was signed at the Pakistan Embassy in Moscow by Secretary Industries and Production, Saif Anjum and General Director of Industries Engineering LLC of Russia, Vadim Velichko, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Industries and Production.
“Reviving PSM with Russia’s support reflects our shared history and commitment to a stronger industrial future,” said Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan, who was also present at the occasion along with Pakistan’s Ambassador to the Russian Federation Muhammad Khalid Jamali.
The project aims to restart and expand steel production, marking a new chapter in bilateral cooperation, as per the press release.
A day ago, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Pakistan and Russia were “natural allies” and that Moscow viewed Islamabad as an important strategic partner in the areas of economy and energy.
The two countries have remained actively engaged on diplomatic fronts recently.
On June 3, Russian Foreign Min­ister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan.
The countries are also engaged in multiple rail connectivity projects.</p><small>2025-07-11 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1111471955aee78.png?r=123823' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923488/roof-collapse-injures-6-as-heavy-rains-cause-flooding-in-kps-charsadda' target='_blank'><strong>Roof collapse injures 6 as heavy rains cause flooding in KP’s Charsadda</strong></a><br><p>Six members of a family, including four children, were injured after the roof of a mud house collapsed due to heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda district in the early hours of Friday, a rescue official said.
Rescue 1122, Charsadda’s District Emergency Officer Jawad Ali told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Omarzai area, where the roof of a house collapsed, adding that his team responded promptly and recovered the injured from the debris.
“The injured were transported to the district headquarters hospital in Charsadda for medical assistance,” he said. “The Rescue 1122 team had also provided first aid to the injured on the spot and in the ambulances; they seemed out of danger.”
According to the DEO Ali, four of the injured were guests from Karachi. Of the four children, aged five to nine, three suffered multiple injuries, while the fourth suffered a forehead wound.
The DEO appealed to the public to take precautionary measures during the monsoon season.
Meanwhile, Ali and Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Azmat Wazir both said in statements that the water level in the Pali Dam surged due to heavy rains on the night of July 10 and 11, causing a flooding situation in the Jundi River.
They added that Rescue 1122, civil defence, revenue and administration teams had been alerted and were in the field to monitor the situation.
 
 

“Rescue 1122 Charsadda took timely action on the flood situation in the Jundi river,” the DEO said, adding that he personally supervised the operations.
He said six ambulances, a disaster vehicle, a water rescue vehicle, and a total of 90 rescue personnel participated in the operations.
“A total of 105 people were rescued and taken to safe places in the affected areas”, Ali said, adding that four people were rescued from Sherpao Kanyur and 10 people were taken to a safe place from Omarzai. Similarly, 76 people were taken to shelter homes from Gedar Kaly.
The deputy commissioner urged the public to avoid visiting the riverside this season, as has already been banned, to avoid any mishap.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) alerted the district administrations across the province to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17.
On Sunday, six people lost their lives while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the PDMAs of both provinces. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Meanwhile, due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have triggered flash floods and landslides in various areas of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan. Two boys drowned in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of KP’s Mansehra on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-11 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1111514298f3f65.png?r=115303' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923483/musks-tesla-marks-formal-india-entry-with-mumbai-launch-event' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event</strong></a><br><p>Tesla will open its first India showroom in Mumbai next week, having imported $1 million worth of cars and merchandise, marking its entry into the world’s third-largest car market despite CEO Elon Musk’s complaints about high import tariffs.
In an invitation to the media on Thursday, the carmaker said the July 15 event was the “launch of Tesla in India through the opening of the Tesla experience centre at Bandra Kurla Complex,” located in the city’s leading commercial business district.
Grappling with excess manufacturing capacity at its other factories and falling sales, Tesla has pivoted to selling imported cars in India, on which it will need to pay about 70 per cent import duty and other levies.
Commercially available custom records from January to June showed Tesla imported vehicles, chargers and accessories into India worth close to $1m, mainly from China and the United States.
The vehicles included six of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y at a shipment value of $32,500 each for five cars, and $46,000 for the long-range version, as well as several Superchargers.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has for years wooed Tesla, including forming a new policy to attract the carmaker to build its EVs locally.
Last year, Musk had planned to visit India, where he was expected to announce an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, including in local EV manufacturing. But he cancelled the trip at the last moment. Tesla has conveyed that it is not interested in manufacturing in India at the moment.
US President Donald Trump has said that if Tesla were to build a factory in India to circumvent that country’s tariffs, it would be “unfair” to the US. Tesla has hired for several of the three dozen positions it advertised in India earlier this year, bringing on board store managers, sales and service executives. It is looking for supply chain engineers and vehicle operators for its autopilot ambitions.</p><small>2025-07-11 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1111000995a1894.jpg?r=111346' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479/trump-threatens-canada-with-35pc-tariff-rate-starting-aug-1' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens Canada with 35pc tariff rate starting Aug 1</strong></a><br><p>Canada will face a 35 per cent tariff on exports to the United States starting August 1, President Donald Trump said on Thursday in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney.
It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his trade war threats against dozens of economies.
Canada and the US have been locked in trade negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal by July 21, but the latest threat appeared to have shifted that deadline.
Both Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries — known as the USMCA — can be put back on track.
“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses.
We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1,“ Carney posted on the social media platform X Thursday night.
 






The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the previous NAFTA accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office.
It was due to be reviewed by July next year, but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.
Canadian and Mexican products were initially hard hit by 25pc US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy.
Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.
But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swaths of products.
The letter on Thursday came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney, who has been faced with his counterpart’s regular musings that Canada should become the 51st US state.
Reciprocity
The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial meeting with Trump in the Oval Office.
They met again at the G7 summit last month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.
Canada also agreed to rescind taxes impacting US tech firms that had prompted Trump to retaliate by calling off trade talks.
Separately, Trump announced in an interview with NBC that he was also thinking of slapping blanket tariffs of between 15pc and 20pc on August 1 on countries that had not yet received one of his letters.
The letters announce tariff rates of as much as 50pc in the case of Brazil to kick in on August 1 unless better terms can be found before then.
Trump told NBC that the letter to the 27-country European Union, the US’s biggest trading partner, would be sent “today or tomorrow (Friday).”
Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that he is willing to negotiate with the United States after Trump said he would hit the country with his tough tariff.
He, however, reiterated that the Brazilian government is evaluating reciprocity measures. In his letter addressed to Lula, Trump criticised the treatment of his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro.</p><small>2025-07-11 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11093111370bee3.jpg?r=093115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923436/doctor-seven-paramedics-booked-in-sahiwal-as-woman-dies-after-botched-surgery' target='_blank'><strong>Doctor, seven paramedics booked in Sahiwal as woman dies after ‘botched’ surgery</strong></a><br><p>SAHIWAL: Civil Lines police on Thursday booked a senior woman doctor and a faculty member of the Sahiwal Medical College (SMC), along with seven paramedics, following the death of a female patient after a “botched” surgery at her private clinic on Wednesday night, allegedly because of their negligence.
Reports said Noureen Akhter, 45, was brought to Dr Safia’s private hospital (Al-Shifa) in the Canal Colony, complaining of pain in her uterus. The doctor performed a three-hour uterus removal operation on July 8.
However, Noureen’s condition remained unstable despite the procedure.
Noureen was admitted to a private room of the hospital.
The family says they repeatedly informed the doctor about the patient’s condition, who then performed a second surgery, just 17 hours after the first one.
The family claims that the seven-hour-long second operation was performed on July 9, during which the patient was transfused nine blood bags after her white blood cells count dropped significantly.
The patient’s family and relatives alleged that Noureen was forcefully discharged by the hospital management and later died at the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.
They alleged she died due to the negligence of Dr Safia and her paramedical staff.
They staged a protest demonstration against the doctor, blocking a major city road for about three hours. The demonstrators finally ended the protest after police and the district administration assured them that justice would be done. The body was later handed over to police for completion of the legal procedure and the postmortem examination.
Police later registered a case against Dr Safia Izhar and seven of her paramedical staff under sections 322, 148, and 149 of the PPC on the complaint of Noureen’s husband, Imran Ashraf, a resident of Ferozepur Road, Lahore.
According to the First Information Report (FIR), the family alleges they were “forcefully discharged” from the private clinic on the evening of July 9 at 6pm, despite Noureen’s serious condition. They claim that the hospital staff told them the patient’s “inner organs got damaged during the first surgery.”
With no other choice, the family immediately took Noureen to Sahiwal Teaching Hospital, where she passed away within two hours of her admission.
Civil Lines police say that after the postmortem at the DHQ Hospital, samples of the body have been sent for forensic analysis and the body was handed over to the bereaved family for burial.
Complainant Imran Ashraf told Dawn that they want the Punjab Health Commission to intervene and provide them justice.
KIDNAPPED: Ghalla Mandi police booked a man and his seven unknown accomplicesfor allegedly kidnapping a commission agent, keeping him in illegal confinement for five days, besides sexually assaulting and torturing him.
Amir Hussain, a resident of village 133/9-L, said in his complaint to police that he was kidnapped from Fatoh Moor on July 1 by Asif and his seven accomplices and taken to an unknown location in a pick-up van.
He said Asif and his accomplices allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted him for five days, after administering some tranquilising syrup.
The suspects also recorded a video of the episode, threatening him to upload it on social media.
The complainant also alleged that he was deprived of Rs0.94 million by the suspects, who later threw him at a desolate place.
The victim was shifted to Sahiwal Teaching Hospital by a Rescue 1122 team called by a passerby on July 5, where he received treatment for five days.
Civil Lines police registered a case under section 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine a person) of the PPC.A second-semester female BS student was shot dead, allegedly in an accidental firing by her seven-year-old cousin at village 133/9-L.
SHOT DEAD: As per police sources, the victim, Nimra Noor, was in the courtyard of her house when her uncle arrived with his son, Ali Hasnain (7), who started playing with his father’s loaded pistol.
Suddenly, the pistol went off and the bullet hit Nimra, who died on the spot.
Ghala Mandi police responded to the incident, and following a request by the victim’s family,declared the death “accidental”.

The only exception was the tractor segment, which recorded a sharp 36.4pc decline due to continued stress in the agricultural economy.
According to data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association, car sales rose by 38pc to 112,203 units in FY25 from 81,579 units a year earlier.
Light commercial vehicles, pickups, vans, and sport utility vehicles recorded a 61pc increase, with total sales rising to 35,820 units from 22,250.
Truck sales more than doubled, jumping 103pc to 4,444 units compared to 2,187 in FY24, while bus sales grew 74pc to 788 units from 454. The two- and three-wheeler segments also showed improvement, with sales climbing 32pc to 1.518 million units from 1.150m units.
However, tractor sales plunged to 29,192 units in FY25 from 45,911 units in FY24, reflecting subdued farm income and weak rural demand.
Myesha Sohail of Topline Securities said car, LCV, jeep, and pickup sales in June 2025 alone reached 21,773 units — a 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month increase.
The sharp MoM rise was driven primarily by pre-buying ahead of the July 1 hike in general sales tax (GST) from 12.5pc to 18pc, with Suzuki Alto sales reaching a 39-month high.
She added that the YoY growth was supported by a stable macroeconomic environment, lower interest rates, easing inflation, a stronger rupee, and improving consumer confidence. The availability of new car variants also contributed to the rising trend.
Among manufacturers, Pak Suzuki Motor Company led the market with sales of 72,685 units in FY25, up 34pc. Indus Motor Company followed with a 61pc increase, selling 33,393 units. Honda Atlas Cars Limited sold 18,296 units, marking a 38pc rise, while Hyundai Nishat’s sales grew 20pc to 10,954 units.
Sazgar Engineering posted one of the most impressive growth rates, with sales doubling to 10,844 units in FY25 — up 102pc from the previous year — boosted by strong demand for its newly facelifted Haval model.
Looking ahead, Sohail expects the positive momentum in the auto sector to continue into FY26, driven by lower borrowing costs and upcoming launches across various fuel technologies, including hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.

According to SBP data released on Thursday, the central bank’s reserves rose primarily on the back of official inflows, though no specific breakdown was provided.
Bankers said the SBP purchased over $8bn from the interbank market during FY25, supported by record-high remittances of $38.3bn.
These inflows were primarily driven by incentives offered to banks on transactions from overseas Pakistanis. However, the government is now considering scrapping these incentives, though no final decision has been made.
The central bank also maintained a tight grip on dollar outflows throughout the year, particularly during the final quarter, frustrating importers who struggled to secure foreign exchange. This control on imports, combined with heavy dollar buying, led to a shortage that gradually pushed the exchange rate upward.
Some bankers noted that to attract more remittances, banks were offering higher rates to overseas senders — exceeding official dollar quotes — to capitalise on per-transaction incentives.
The dollar’s appreciation in the local market continued on Thursday. The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported the interbank rate at Rs284.76, up 10 paise from the previous day, while the open market rate rose 50 paise to Rs287.50.
This rise came despite the US dollar weakening globally against major currencies, with the greenback slipping further from a two-week high on Thursday.
Currency analysts believe the SBP’s reserve build-up could continue in FY26, potentially reaching $20bn. However, this would depend on sustained remittance inflows, rollover of a significant portion of external debt, and smooth relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Pakistan faced little difficulty in securing commercial loans during FY25, largely due to its continued participation in the IMF programme — a factor expected to sustain investor confidence and ease access to external financing.
As of July 4, the country’s total foreign exchange reserves stood at $20.028bn, including $5.526bn held by commercial banks, according to SBP data.

• Claims Rs191bn saved in FY25 as power losses dip due to governance reforms
• Govt eyes 6,000MW surplus supply for crypto, data centres
ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is making another attempt to convince the federal cabinet to curtail returns on solar net metering and remove electricity duty on consumer bills being resisted by the provinces.
Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Power Minister Awais Leghari said he would be presenting a revised plan to the federal cabinet in a week or two based on consultations with some stakeholders to stagger the recovery of investment on net metering to two to three years from the current one and a half years.
Mr Leghari also announced that the Power Division on Thursday moved a summary for cabinet approval to finalise rules for wheeling charges, a key step towards operationalising the competitive electricity trading market.
He added that the government was exploring plans to offer 5,000-6,000MW of surplus electricity at marginal costs to industries such as data centres and crypto mining, and discussions were underway with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The minister said that a change in the net metering arrangement would not reduce the electricity tariff, but there would be no further increase in rates. Unless measures are introduced, the expansion of solar systems could add to the surplus on the grid. The combination of the sale of surplus power and the containment of solar expansion would help grid stability, he said.
Mr Leghari said the consumers had adopted solar net metering under a government policy and would not be penalised, but its return had become unjustified. If not corrected, even the net metering consumers would be bearing billions of rupees worth of electricity bills in future.
He said the government had saved over Rs3 trillion from negotiations with the independent power producers, cancelled over 10,000MW of new power plants out of 17,000MW committed capacity and saved over Rs4tr in future payments, whereas correction of net metering was also on the agenda.
Mr Leghari said he had written letters to the chief ministers to convey that power distribution companies (Discos) would no longer act as collection agents of electricity duty for provinces.
He said that only one chief minister had so far responded, and once the remaining three give their feedback, a case would be presented before the federal cabinet for a final decision.
Mr Leghari said the Power Division had been able to reduce recovery, transmission and distribution losses through good governance.
He said the government suffered a Rs591 billion loss in fiscal year 2024 due to less billing and higher technical losses of Discos.
This money could have utilised in the development or any other meaningful sector, he added.
The minister said in fiscal 2025, this loss was brought by Rs191bn to Rs399bn through good governance.
 






The government has appointed board of directors to Discos “on merit and without any political consideration”.
He said Discos had been given the target of Rs100bn annual reduction over the next five years, but their losses had been cut by Rs191bn even before the start of that five-year period.
This was achieved through improvement in recoveries, he said, explaining that the Discos had suffered Rs315bn loss in FY24 when recovery against billing stood at 92.4 per cent.
The bill recovery was improved to 96.6pc in FY25, bringing down these losses to just Rs132bn, as the recovery rate of five Punjab and Islamabad companies was beyond 101pc.
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, mostly attributed to electricity theft, fell slightly from Rs276bn in FY24 to Rs266bn in FY25, with losses decreasing from 18.3pc to 17.6pc.
The minister added that savings could have been higher — around Rs225 billion — had the government been able to appoint new boards for Hyderabad and Sukkur Electric, which remain delayed due to litigation.
He revealed the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had uncovered massive electricity theft at four steel and furnace factories using tampered meters.
He claimed the factory owners wielded significant influence and attempted to remove security officials and Disco staff involved in the investigation. However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and government institutions backed the anti-theft campaign.
The minister said the Power Division and Discos would focus on recoveries, dismantle networks of theft and improve governance and overall efficiencies.
Responding to a question, Mr Leghari said the Power Division believed that since K-Electric’s overwhelming reliance would now be on the national grid, the uniformity of tariff should extend to fuel costs as well as quarterly adjustments.
He said K-Electric’s import from the grid had increased to 1,600MW from 1,000MW, which would further go up by another 400MW with additional interconnection within a month.
He said the Power Division would engage with the power regulator and present a detailed point of view before the federal cabinet for an amicable and sustainable solution.
The power minister conceded that LNG import contracts were made almost a decade ago on the assumption that LNG-based power plants would operate on LNG and consume 100pc of imports.
However, he stressed that no power plant should be operated without a fuel-based merit order. Therefore, the previous assumptions did not materialise.
“We believe that violation of economic merit order is a mortal sin,” he said, adding that the only solution was to review LNG contracts as had been done in the case of independent power producers.
