The by-election is being held after the seat fell vacant in July following the death of PTI MNA Mian Azhar, the father of party leader Hammad Azhar.
Hammad issued “important instructions” for his party’s polling agents in a post on X today: “When the bags containing election materials are opened in the morning, make sure that the Forms 45 and Forms 46 in them are blank and shown to you. This is most important.”
The PTI leader stressed the importance of the polling agents’ presence during the polling and the counting processes. “The polling boxes must not be out of sight at any moment.”
Hammad further told the agents that it was their “right to obtain the Form-45 [filled] as per the count”, and that any staff who obstructed this would be liable to strict legal punishment.
He directed all PTI workers at the party camps outside the polling stations to remain there after the polling had ended and “peacefully follow the presiding officer to the returning officer’s (RO) office”.
 






In another post, Hammad also gave a message to the presiding officers and the polling staff, urging them not to indulge in any “illegal act”.
“We are aware that you are being frightened and threatened,” the PTI leader claimed, adding that those who were allegedly doing so were “finding immunity for themselves, buying property abroad and moving their families there”.
“They will push you into [carrying out] unconstitutional actions and flee themselves,” Hammad contended.
“Be careful! Do not put yourself in difficulty by taking any serious and illegal action at the behest of any intruder,” the PTI leader said, urging them to fulfil their duty.
 






The NA-129 seat is being contested by Mian Azhar’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad — nominated by Hammad, who himself is absconding as he is wanted by the state in different cases. Hafiz Mian Nauman, who was defeated by Mian Azhar by a margin of over 30,000 votes in the 2024 elections, is once again the PML-N’s candidate.
The PTI has accused the PML-N’s Punjab government of employing rigging tactics in support of its candidate in the NA-129 by-poll.
Yesterday, Hammad said officials of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) were appointed as presiding officers for the polls contested by Nauman, who has served as chairman of the Lesco Board of Directors (BoD).
Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt, however, rebutted Hammad’s post, stating that the appointments were the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and not Lesco or any other government organisation.
 
 

Before the election campaign could pick up, the local police officials, caught on video footage, were seen removing banners of the PTI candidate.
Similar to the situation during the 2024 general elections, Ahmad is contesting as an independent candidate on the “geyser” symbol, instead of the “bat” due to the revocation of the party’s electoral symbol last year.</p><small>2025-11-22 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22143635840f11a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956703/judges-transfer-case-5-ihc-judges-file-plea-challenging-fixing-of-intra-court-appeal-before-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Judges’ transfer case: 5 IHC judges file plea challenging fixing of intra-court appeal before FCC</strong></a><br><p>Significant progress was reported on Saturday in the ongoing litigation over the transfer of judges, as five judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) filed a miscellaneous petition before the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) challenging the transfer of their intra-court appeal from the Supreme Court to the former.
The application was filed by IHC’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Saman Riffat Imtiaz and Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The case pertains to the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital. In June, the SC’s Constitutional Bench had declared that their transfers were not unconstitutional. Subsequently, the five IHC judges had challenged the decision and filed an intra-court appeal.
However, the intra-court appeal in the case has now been fixed before the FCC, which was established under the 27th Amendment, on November 24.
In the miscellaneous petition, the IHC judges asked the FCC to return the intra-court appeal to the SC, arguing that the matter constitutionally falls within the jurisdiction of the apex court.
The petition stated that the appeal was shifted to the FCC under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, but contended that the amendment itself contradicted the Constitution.
In their application, the petitioners argued that the Constitution clearly outlined the legislature, executive, and judiciary as the three essential pillars of the state and delineated limits and powers for each.
The judges maintained that while Parliament holds the authority to amend the Constitution, such powers could not be exercised to abolish, restructure, or fundamentally weaken the judiciary, which forms an integral component of the constitutional framework.
They further asserted that several apex court judgments affirm the separation of powers and the protection of judicial independence, insisting that the appellate jurisdiction in such matters remained with the SC unless expressly provided otherwise without affecting the judiciary’s constitutional existence.
The petition stressed that transferring the appeal to the FCC on the basis of the 27th Amendment was legally flawed since the amendment itself was under challenge for being inconsistent with the Constitution’s basic structure.
With the new miscellaneous petition filed, the FCC is now expected to determine whether it can proceed with the appeal or whether the matter must be returned to the Supreme Court for adjudication.
Four of the same five IHC judges, excluding Justice Jahangiri, who wanted to challenge the recently introduced 27th Amendment, were turned away by the SC earlier this week and told to approach the FCC. The judges had drafted a petition invoking the original jurisdiction of the top court under Article 184(3), and sent a representation to the apex court’s registry branch.
According to the draft petition, the judges had also challenged the amendments to Article 200, which allowed the transfer of high court judges without their consent. They had argued that such provisions exposed judges to pressure, fear of retaliation, and manipulation of court composition.

Every rattle is a pushback against the stigma of disability.
Sri Lanka and India are co-hosting the first T20 World Cup for visually impaired women.
The semi-finals are on Saturday between India and Australia and Pakistan and Nepal, followed by the final on Sunday.
India manager Shika Shetty told AFP that the sport has transformed lives and helped change attitudes.
“I think this (world cup) is one of the biggest opportunities for our visually impaired girls,” said Shetty, who is not blind.
 






India captain T.C. Deepika recalled the disbelief she faced when she first picked up the bat.
“People were saying, ‘How do they do it? They must be lying,’” she said in a video posted by the Cricket Association for the Blind in India.
“(Later) they realised I can do something. People began to see that I have ability,” Deepika added.
Playing by the ear
While able-bodied cricket requires players to keep an eye on the ball at all times, blind players must have sharp ears.
The white plastic ball, the size of a tennis ball, is packed with ball bearings that rattle as it rolls.
The bowler must ask the striker if he or she is ready and then yell “play” as the jingling ball is delivered underarm with at least one bounce.
Like a regular cricket match, each side has 11 players, but at least four must be totally blind. They are required to wear blindfolds for fairness.
Fielders clap once to reveal their positions.
Others are partially sighted, classified by how far they can see — two metres for B2 players, six for B3.
Each team can have up to eight B1, or totally blind, players. Any run scored by a B1 player is counted as two.
‘Liberating’
Chaminda Karunaratne says cricket has been both a refuge and a way to prove that blindness cannot impede his sporting ambitions.
The blind 40-year-old Sri Lankan school teacher has represented his country in international tournaments and now wants women to share that space.
“Cricket has done wonders, especially for my mental health,” Karunaratne said as the Indian and Pakistan women’s teams battled it out on the ground.

“When you get into a sport like this it boosts your self-confidence, you can move more freely and you tend to take part in community activities,” he said.
“That is liberating.”
Karunaratne, a key member of the Sri Lanka Cricket Association for the Visually Handicapped, added: “I appeal to parents to send their blind girls to take up cricket. It is an opportunity to interact with others.”
“You can show that you are not helpless, not dependent,” he said.
Association president Sudesh Tharanga admitted forming a women’s team had been a challenge, although nearly a million Sri Lankans are estimated to have some form of visual impediment.
“We started assembling a team only after we were asked in September if we could co-host the T20 tournament in November,” Tharanga told AFP.
Despite limited preparations Sri Lanka managed to field one of the tournament’s youngest squads.</p><small>2025-11-22 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22131718e1607db.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956689/ai-deepfakes-the-latest-weapon-in-pakistans-disinfo-wars' target='_blank'><strong>AI deepfakes: The latest weapon in Pakistan’s disinfo wars</strong></a><br><p>I have spent the past few weeks staring at what seem to be digital ghosts; they look human, speak the way we do, and cause anger and despair. But they are not real. They are machines wearing human skin.
Something is shifting in Pakistan’s social media landscape. It is not merely a rumour. It is not the old cycle of misinformation. It feels darker. Artificial intelligence is reshaping reality frame by frame until the internet resembles a hall of mirrors.
For me, it began on November 8, when an account called ‘PakVocals’ posted a video on X that claimed to show journalist Benazir Shah dancing in a nightclub. The caption was cruel. It tried to mock her by using derogatory comments against her professional credibility. At the time of writing this piece, that video had garnered more than half a million views.
It did exactly what it was designed to do: turn a journalist into a target. Mission accomplished!
To most viewers, the clip probably passed as real, but for me, something felt off.
When the mask slips
I opened the clip in DaVinci Resolve — a video editing software that can be downloaded online — and watched it frame by frame because deepfakes are rarely perfect; they usually leave behind little crumbs of evidence.
And at the 30th frame, I found it!
For a split second, the skin tone flickered. The outline of the face rippled like water. The mask, it seems, had slipped — a clear sign of face manipulation had thus been identified.

I then used Google Lens, another free online tool, to scan multiple screenshots of the deepfake video. The aim was to identify the source of the video, and success was clearly in sight when several search results popped up, one after the other.
The body in the video didn’t belong to Benazir Shah but to Indian actress Jannat Zubair Rahmani — the clothes were the same, and so was the lighting. The only thing the fakers had changed was the face.

On X, Shah called out the deepfake video and noted that the account was followed by the information minister of the incumbent government. That is when the story took a weird turn. ‘PakVocals’ issued an apology, citing religious fear of slander. But despite the pious language, the video is still there, which shows that their true intention was to damage someone’s reputation.
 






On November 18, another X account by the name ‘Princess Hania Shah’ posted a new deepfake of Benazir Shah and accused her of being a “traitor”. This deepfake edit was a lazy attempt, I thought to myself. But the intent, again, was dangerous.
This time, I didn’t even need editing software. I used Google Lens to put the fake video side-by-side with the original footage I found online. They were perfect mirrors — same moves, same lighting, just a different face. It took five minutes to prove it was a lie. Yet, more than 180,000 people had already watched it.

Fact-checking — a necessity
X, formerly Twitter, has a system called “Community Notes” designed to flag fake content. But it has failed too many times. Deepfake videos are still up on the social media platform without a warning label.
What’s worse is that when users asked X’s own AI chatbot, Grok, to verify the videos, it failed to identify them as AI-generated content, revealing the limitations of billion-dollar algorithms. Simply put, we can’t rely on tech giants to protect us. If third-party fact-checkers fail to do their job, nobody will.
With every passing day, fact-checking is becoming a necessity, especially during times of conflict and wars, because AI-manipulated content is not just consumed by ordinary people but also by mainstream news media.
During the recent Israel-Iran conflict in mid-2025, a viral post on X allegedly showed analysts at an Israeli news channel fleeing their studio after a purported strike by Iran. While the footage initially seemed convincing, closer inspection revealed ghostly movements, immaculate camera panning and flat audio. But many Pakistani news outlets aired the clip as an authentic event.

After the Benazir Shah deepfakes, just a few hours later, I found another deepfake video. It claimed to show Pakistani soldiers abusing a Baloch woman in a desert setting. The account that posted the clip, namely ‘Yousuf Bahand’, added a taunt: “Some will say this is fake.”
He was right. It is a fake!
I went back to the frame-by-frame analysis. The clues were in plain sight. The name tags on the soldiers’ uniforms read “PRMRACCH” and “BAMY” — a classic AI mistake in writing text, hallucinating words while producing gibberish.
 

Screengrab of visual inconsistencies in the video.

The clip was crammed with other visual inconsistencies as well. For one, one of the hands of the supposed soldier in the video appeared to be merged into the hands of the woman.
Not just the video, but the audio too gave it away. When the soldier yelled “damn it”, it came out in a clean American accent, nothing like what you’d expect in that setting. So I ran the clip through FFMPEG, a command-line tool that converts audio or video formats.
The data showed something you never see in a real desert recording: 0.21 seconds of total silence at the very start. In a windy, open environment, the mic always picks up ambient noise the moment it switches on. That dead air only happens when someone pastes the audio track onto the video later.
 


And this is not a one-off episode of playing on real issues. I remember, for instance, the wide circulation of clips showing cows drowning during the 2025 Punjab floods. Instead of authentic chaos, the videos presented a sterile calm: unnaturally still, perfectly framed, and entirely lacking the expected camera tremor or human sounds.
Unfortunately, most viewers appeared to stop at the initial shock of the disaster, arguably failing to question the engineers behind the synthetic content.
The ‘AI Slop’
A recent BBC investigation revealed that Pakistan has become a global hub for “AI Slop”. Creators appear to be mass-producing fake content, using real-world settings to spread lies, just to game algorithms and earn money. The incentive is simple: virality pays, truth does not.
Until early 2024, AI videos were mostly a glitchy novelty shared by enthusiasts, but the landscape arguably shifted with Sora (OpenAI), which created a sense of competition in the market with heavy hitters such as X’s Grok and Google’s Veo.
But to their credit, Google just stepped in with a partial remedy: its Gemini chatbot can now flag images created with Google’s own AI tools by detecting invisible SynthID watermarks, a technology that embeds invisible watermarks into AI-generated content like images, audio, and text to identify it as machine-created.
 
 

The tools I used to expose these lies are free. Anyone can use them. But unfortunately, the tools to make these lies are just as accessible. That is the frightening symmetry: anyone with an ulterior motive, whether financial or otherwise, can fabricate a reality, but not everyone will have the incentive to break through such fabrications.
AI isn’t a futuristic threat anymore. It is a street-level weapon. The next viral clip you see might not be real at all, yet the truth still sits there beneath the distortions. You only have to slow down long enough to find it. Sometimes it is a flicker on a cheek. Sometimes it is a melting hand. Sometimes there is a silence in the waveform.
The ghosts can be unmasked, but only if we choose to look closely.

The political opposites, a Republican billionaire and a young democratic socialist, have clashed over everything from immigration to economic policy.
But it was clear the two forged a rapport in their first encounter.
Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, stood by Trump’s desk as the 79-year-old president smiled up at him and patted him warmly on the arm, having only recently falsely caricatured Mamdani as an anti-Semitic communist, among other jibes.
 






“We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said after letting journalists and cameras into the Oval Office at the end of a private meeting with the mayor-elect.
“We have one thing in common: We want this city of ours that we love to do very well.”
The meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump has sometimes embarrassed or chastised visiting heads of state, far exceeded Trump’s prediction earlier on Friday that it would be “quite cordial”.
The men, two different generations of New Yorkers, announced nothing new on policy except what seemed to be the launch of an unexpected, politics-shifting professional friendship.
“What I really appreciate about the president is that the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,” Mamdani said.
Just 26 per cent of Americans say Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Meanwhile, Mamdani, promising a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, was one of a slew of Democratic victors around the country in elections earlier this month.
It was among the most deflating nights endured by Republicans this year, and Trump had not been expected to enjoy the reminder through a visit by one of the most prominent Democratic winners.
Yet the president, who found his fame as a New York real estate developer, brightened at Mamdani’s call for more housing in the city he will lead from January 1.
Trump was cheered to hear a chunk of New Yorkers who voted for him in last year’s presidential election had gone on to vote for Mamdani.
“When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak of the cost of living,” Mamdani said.
Trump, who says he is paying increasing attention to affordability and inflation, said this made sense to him.
“Some of his ideas are the same ideas I have,” Trump explained. “The better he does, the happier I am.”
Mamdani, Trump laugh off past insults
As Mamdani surged in the polls to victory on November 4, Trump issued threats to strip federal funding from New York City. Mamdani has regularly criticised Trump’s promise to ramp up federal immigration enforcement efforts in a city where four in 10 residents are foreign-born.
In the weeks before they met, Trump had labeled Mamdani a “radical left lunatic,” a communist and a “Jew hater”.
Mamdani has espoused Nordic-style democratic socialism, not communism.
While a staunch critic of Israel, he was endorsed by prominent Jewish politicians, is bringing Jewish staff into his new administration, notably New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, and has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism.

And yet, less than an hour after first meeting each other in person, Trump was repeatedly coming to Mamdani's aid to fend off pointed questions from the press.

The pair laughed away some of their spicier insults as reporters reminded them of what they had said about each other.

“I've been called much worse than a despot,” Trump said with a smile. “So it's not that insulting, but I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.”

Mamdani was asked if he still considered Trump a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’,” Trump interjected, swapping grins with Mamdani and patting his arm twice. “It’s easier than explaining it.”
 






Trump defends Mamdani as ‘very rational person’
Trump also defended the Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City’s first Muslim mayor, from some of the Islamophobic slurs he has faced.
One reporter asked Trump if he believed he had “a jihadist” standing by him.
“No, I don’t,” Trump said as Mamdani looked on. “I met with a man who’s a very rational person.”
Some politicians and commentators were discombobulated by the televised friendliness. At least a couple Republicans said they still did not trust Mamdani, Trump’s new approval notwithstanding.
“What the heck just happened?” US Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote on social media, sharing a clip of one of the meeting’s Trump-Mamdani buddy moments.
 






Trump had repeatedly urged New Yorkers not to vote for Mamdani, warning it would be a disaster for a city that is already portrayed as a crime-ridden hellscape by conservative media, despite being among the safest big cities in the country.
After his first term as president, Trump decamped from Manhattan to become a Florida resident.
A reporter asked Trump if he would consider moving back to the city of his birth with Mamdani running it.
“Yeah, I would,” Trump said, “especially after the meeting.”</p><small>2025-11-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22130211a1c2f76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956699/india-trade-unions-condemn-new-labour-codes-plan-nationwide-protests' target='_blank'><strong>India trade unions condemn new labour codes, plan nationwide protests</strong></a><br><p>Ten large Indian trade unions condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers.
The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn ahead of nationwide protests they plan to hold on November 26 (Wednesday).
Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment. It says the changes improve worker protections.
While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily.
Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years.
 


The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows.
The rules allow longer factory shifts and night work for women, while raising the threshold for firms that need prior approval for layoffs to 300 workers from 100, giving companies greater flexibility in workforce management.
 


The codes define gig and platform work for the first time, expanding legal and social protection to workers outside traditional employment structures.
The gig workforce has surged since the pandemic, with more than 23.5 million expected to be employed in the sector by 2030, up from around 10m in 2024/25, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.

 
 

Businesses have long criticised India’s work rules as a drag on manufacturing, which contributes less than a fifth to the country’s nearly $4 trillion economy. Strengthening the manufacturing sector is key to creating jobs in the world’s most populous country.
But the Association of Indian Entrepreneurs expressed concern that the new rules would significantly increase operating costs for small and midsize enterprises and disrupt business continuity across key sectors. It asked the government for transitional support and flexible implementation mechanisms.
“The labour codes have been implemented despite strong opposition from the trade unions and it will snatch the workers’ rights, including fixed-term jobs and rights available under the earlier labour laws,” said Amarjeet Kaur, national general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).

Not all unions oppose the overhaul. The right-wing Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh, aligned with Modi's party, called on states to implement them after consultations on some of the codes.
The labour ministry said the codes — covering wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety — would “ensure better wages, safety, social security and welfare for the country’s workforce”.
The codes will replace 29 existing laws. Indian states are expected to craft rules aligning with the new federal codes covering wages, industrial relations and occupational safety.
Despite parliamentary approval in 2020, the BJP had until now not been able to implement the laws uniformly across the country due to political resistance and opposition from some unions.
Modi yesterday defended the overhaul, saying on X that the codes would serve as “a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities”, adding that the reforms would boost job creation and productivity.

In May, the government had enacted the 60-day import and export ban on precious metals and gemstones to stabilise its foreign exchange reserves. The restriction was also linked to the military conflict with India as a potential strategy to limit the flow of precious metals via Dubai.
In a fresh SRO2198 dated November 21, the Ministry of Commerce rescinded its May directives for the ban, thereby allowing the import and export of gold and other precious metals.
The ministry further said the period of suspension so far under SRO760 was “accordingly condoned, thereby enabling exporters to avail the mandatory entitlement period of 120 days under the entrustment scheme”.
The entrustment scheme provides a facility for the export of jewellery against imported gold supplied as a partial advance payment, by the foreign buyer in the manufacturing of jewellery to be exported. In addition, exporters are required to only export eligible and authorised items within 120 days from the date of import.
 
 

Gold is still used as a traditional store of value and is an important part of Pakistan’s cultural, financial, and manufacturing sectors. Pakistan predominantly imports gold from the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and other gold-trading hubs.
Industry leaders had previously stated that the restrictions on gold trade had effectively paralysed the gold and jewellery export sector, with exporters unable to fulfill orders despite having received raw gold under legal contracts from international buyers.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh had called for the immediate restoration of SRO 760 to protect the jewellery export industry.
In October, the Economic Coordination Committee had approved the continuation of the existing framework with enhanced transparency and automation measures to improve efficiency and traceability on the import and export policy for precious metals and jewellery.
Amendments to 2013 rules for jewellery import, export
Separately, the Ministry of Commerce also made several amendments to SRO760, originally titled ‘Import and Export of Precious Metals, Jewellery and Gemstones Order 2013’.
It renamed SRO760 to ‘Import and Export of Precious Metals and Jewellery Order 2013’. Further, the definition of “jewellery passbook”, issued by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), has been expanded to include “either paper or digital” versions of it by amending Clause 2(j).
 
 

TDAP monitors the import of gold and export of jewellery. All transactions are recorded in ‘jewellery passbook’ which are authenticated by the authority.
Further, the scope of trade allowed under Clause 3(2) has been clarified from “the import or export of precious metals, gemstones and jewellery” to “the import of precious metals and gemstones and export of jewellery”.
Regarding customs stations where exports or imports are allowed under Clause 3(9), the government has specified the procedure in case of operational issues by adding: “In the event of operational constraints, a no objection certificate shall be required from the respective additional or deputy collector of customs to allow one-time change of customs stations.”
On imports allowed under the entrustment scheme, the second provision of “import” under Clause 4(2) now includes that the contract may be apostilled under the Apostille Convention, 1961.
The provision now reads: “TDAP shall ensure that the contract signed by the supplier is notarised from the relevant foreign country’s legal authorities, duly attested by the relevant Pakistan Missions abroad or apostilled under the Apostille Convention, 1961 where applicable. The contract shall contain inter alia, all information as prescribed in Annex-D.”

In a video posted online, the 51-year-old congresswoman, elected in 2020, said she had “always been despised in Washington DC and never fit in”.
Greene added she did not want her supporters and family to endure “a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms”.
 






The resignation marks the clearest sign yet of a growing rift in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, which has been shaken by strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, including the leftist New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who met with Trump earlier on Friday.
Greene’s break with Trump appeared linked to his flip-flop on releasing emails connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, a wealthy financier, had cultivated ties with elite politicians, business leaders, academics and celebrities, and was accused of trafficking girls and young women for sex.
Greene referenced the affair in her resignation speech.
“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.
Trump, in a phone interview with ABC News, described Greene’s resignation as “great news from the country”, adding that she had not given him notice but “it doesn’t matter … I think she should be happy”.
Earlier this week, Congress passed and Trump signed a law requiring government records on Epstein to be made public, after months of the former president attempting to block their release.
 
 

Before reversing his position, Trump had withdrawn all support for Greene, whom he dubbed “Wacky Marjorie”, and attacked her on Truth Social as a “lightweight” and “traitor” to the Republican Party. Greene subsequently reported receiving a wave of threats.
A prominent MAGA ally, Greene had championed Trump’s agenda, advocated for immigrant deportation, gun rights, and vaccine scepticism.
The rupture comes amid criticism of Trump over the US cost of living and the Epstein scandal. Greene’s departure sparked speculation she may run for president in 2028, which she dismissed as “baseless gossip”.
In her resignation speech, Greene highlighted her loyalty to Trump and the Republican Party. She said she “fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans”, spending “millions” of her own money.
Greene also contrasted herself with “establishment Republicans who secretly hate him and who stabbed him in the back”. She emphasised, “My voting record has been solidly with my party and the president. Loyalty should be a two-way street.”</p><small>2025-11-22 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/221124311711108.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956693/terrorist-plot-to-blow-up-bridge-in-bannu-foiled' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist plot to blow up bridge in Bannu foiled</strong></a><br><p>A terrorist plot to blow up a bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was foiled on Saturday.
According to an official statement from KP police, terrorists attempted to blow up Dawa bridge in Bannu’s Basia Khel area using an improvised explosive device (IED). It said that the plot was thwarted due to timely action by the Bannu police bomb disposal squad.
It said that the terrorists had attached the IED, a bucket full of 8-10 kilogrammes of explosive material, to the central pillar of the bridge.
“The local people praised the timely action taken by Bannu police,” the statement said.
It also quoted Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan as saying that it was necessary to “eliminate elements inconveniencing the public by destroying infrastructure”. He asserted that such elements do not deserve any mercy.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Yesterday, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu, according to police. Police officials had told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
Earlier this week, a bid to blow up another bridge in Bannu had failed when an IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.</p><small>2025-11-22 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2210341608c02ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956688/vietnam-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-55-as-rescuers-race-to-find-more-than-a-dozen-missing' target='_blank'><strong>Vietnam flooding death toll rises to 55 as rescuers race to find more than a dozen missing</strong></a><br><p>Rescuers raced to find more than a dozen people still missing on Saturday after a week of heavy flooding in Vietnam, where authorities said at least 55 people have died.

The petition, filed by Mohammad Shafiq Mir, owner of a PSO station on Srinagar Highway, was heard by Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The court has ordered a response from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), Aramco Asia Singapore Pvt Ltd, Gas & Oil Pakistan Ltd (GO), Askar Oil, and several other government bodies.
The petitioners counsel Kashif Ali Malik argued that the Saudi state-owned oil company, has been running petrol pumps under its own branding without being a registered corporate entity in Pakistan and without obtaining a mandatory marketing license from OGRA.
The petitioner contends that this violates the OGRA Ordinance, the Pakistan Oil Rules 2016, the Petroleum Act, and the Explosives Act.
He claims the Aramco outlet near his station is operating by relying on licences and permits, including an explosives licence, that were originally granted to local companies Gas & Oil Pakistan Ltd and Askar Oil.
Such an arrangement, the petition argues, is illegal and creates “serious safety, regulatory, and competitive distortions.”
OGRA and other authorities were accused of “systemic inaction” for not restraining Aramco’s operations despite the apparent legal breaches, which the petitioner says has caused him financial loss and undermined fair competition.
After a preliminary hearing, Justice Azam Khan issued notices to all respondents, seeking their written replies. The case has been adjourned, with a future hearing date to be determined by the registrar office.

Hearing several identical petitions regarding smog and environmental pollution, Justice Shahid Karim observed that the anti-smog gun would be of no use under these circumstances. He noted that the environment department had extensive powers only if it chooses to use them.
The judge further remarked that the Air Quality Index (AQI) was also high because of smoke-emitting vehicles.
He expressed concern over the vehicles causing pollution and ordered that environmental squads must be visible on the roads for the next two weeks.
Justice Karim pointed out that the vehicles coming from Karachi were causing increased smoke and a higher AQI on GT Road.
 
 

He said many vehicles on the roads were still emitting smoke.
The judge also sought a report on the failure to enforce time restrictions for commercial activities.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of the Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) on the installation of water meters and sought a progress report on the matter.
The judge also sought a report on the Miyawaki forests planted in various areas, including Johar Town.
During the hearing, a counsel for the Parks and Horticulture Authority gave an undertaking to the court that if the authority cut even a single tree, he would resign.
The judge observed that only stern actions can bring improvement.

The country was split in 1971 primarily because we failed to manage the just expectations of the erstwhile eastern province of Pakistan. We experimented with various constitutional formulas to satisfy the aspirations of our former eastern wing, but the half-hearted implementation of the agreed constitutional arrangement in 1956 led to a weakening of trust between the federation and its eastern wing.
The military coup of 1958 and the subsequent 1962 constitution given by one person, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, and its unitary contours further disappointed East Pakistan. Therefore, there is a need to be extra-sensitive when it comes to provincial rights and autonomy, not only in letter but, more importantly, in spirit of the constitutional arrangement.
Fortunately, the near-unanimous passage of the 1973 Constitution created a robust legal base for federalism in what remained of the country, consisting of the four provinces and the federally administered territories. The 18th Constitutional Amendment, passed with broad consensus 37 years later, further strengthened the federal constitutional framework.
 
 

Over the subsequent 15 years, the provinces have emerged much stronger, more prosperous and even more assertive. Although we hear voices pleading for more autonomy or complaining about too much autonomy, the fact is that Pakistan has set a firm constitutional framework for federalism.
While after a long and painful journey, we may have been successful in settling most of our legal issues regarding federalism, the political forces are apparently not conducting politics in the true spirit of the constitutional provisions regarding provincial autonomy. In general, political parties continue to be the proverbial lengthened shadows of their top leaders and there is hardly any ‘devolution’ of powers from the central figure to the provinces. The overall organisation of most of the parties is weak, but as one goes down the hierarchy from federal to local, there is a steep decline in the powers and autonomy of sub-national organisations.
Most of the decisions are taken at the central level, which the provincial set-up is supposed to implement without question. Even if provincial parliamentary boards exist, final decisions about candidate selection for provincial assemblies are taken by the central parliamentary boards which, in many cases, authorise the top party leader to take the decision.
According to the Constitution, the election of the chief minister is the prerogative of the members of the respective provincial assemblies. They do go through the motions of electing a leader of the House but the candidate of the majority party is almost invariably picked by the central party leader who in many cases, may not belong to the province.
Since the Constitution binds assembly members to vote according to party direction or face ouster from the assembly, members have no choice but to go along with the choice of the party leader, even if they have strong reservations about the candidate.

The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions.

To understand the powerlessness of the MPAs, a case in point is the nomination of the little-known and least-qualified Usman Buzdar as a PTI candidate for the position of CM after the 2018 elections. The poor MPAs had absolutely no idea who they would be asked to vote for until party chairman Imran Khan dropped the bombshell just two days before the CM’s election. The members had no role whatsoever in picking the nominee and were generally shocked at the choice but went along with it and elected Mr Buzdar as CM.
 
 

It is now an open secret that the logic behind selecting a weak CM was that there would be no resistance to running the province from the federal capital through the prime minister’s principal secretary. A similar scenario was seen in the case of KP after the 2024 election, when a rather weak and indecisive candidate for the CM’s position was nominated so that the province could be run by the PM’s secretariat.
It would be unfair to single out the PTI in this context. PM Nawaz Sharif’s choice of Ghulam Haider Wyne as Punjab CM in 1990 followed the same pattern. Although Mr Wyne was a seasoned political worker, he was weak as a CM and followed the PM’s directions in running the province without asking any questions.
The top party leadership designs the system to keep CMs dependent on its directions even in routine provincial matters. The former KP chief minister, Mr Ali Amin Gandapur, was asked by his party to seek the directions of the incarcerated party founder Mr Imran Khan before passing the province’s annual budget for 2025-26. He faced extreme criticism when he had to get the budget passed without his leader’s directions as the federal and Punjab governments denied him the opportunity to meet Mr Khan in prison. This must have been one of the reasons he was later removed from his position.
The new CM delayed the formation of his provincial cabinet for 18 days and the provincial government remained nearly paralysed because he wanted to get Mr Khan’s approval by meeting him in jail. But the prison authorities again did not let him meet his leader.
 
 

These are only a few instances; almost the entire political system, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, is geared towards total obedience to the central party leadership in purely provincial matters, making a mockery of provincial autonomy.
Framers of the Constitution have done their job to ensure provincial autonomy; it is now for the political parties and their leadership to devolve their powers to the provincial organisations of the party and the CM, if the party happens to be in power in a province.
Centralisation of powers is not only against the spirit of the Constitution, it also stunts the growth of the party organisation and provincial leadership, weakening democracy in general.

After thanking the people of Bihar, Modi immediately rela­psed into the BJP’s familiar narrative. Criticising the Indian National Congress, Modi pejoratively referred to it as ‘Muslim League-Maoist Congress’ — in part an allusion to the Congress’s purported soft spot for Bihar’s Muslims who constitute 18 per cent of the state’s population.
The BJP’s jubilation is not without cause. The party has emerged as the single largest party for the first time in Bihar by improving its tally to 89 seats compared to 74 in 2020. All in all, the Na­­ti­o­nal Democratic Alliance — the BJP and its allies — surged ahead with 202 seats in the 243-seat assembly.
It is important to understand the drivers behind this remarkable electoral victory in Bihar as the same formula is likely to be repeated in upcoming state elections. Before Chief Minister Nitish Kum­ar, the BJP’s ally in the recent elections, took over two decades ago, Bihar, a state of some 135 million people, had rampant lawlessness or ‘Jungle Raj’.
In the first decade, Kumar focused on providing public goods, mainly roads, bridges and access to electricity. But, failing to create jobs for India’s poorest state, Kumar soon ran out of steam. Instead of turning towards pro-market policies that would generate competition, economic growth and jobs, without increasing the state’s fiscal deficit, Kumar turned more statist in Bihar, where state spending was already at 34pc of GDP, double the national average.

As in India, Pakistan’s political parties are aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers.

Manipulation of macroeconomic policy tools to stimulate the economy and create employment ahead of elections to ensure re-election is known to economists. These tendencies were first captured by the ‘political business cycle’ literature that includes the Nobel laureate William Nordhaus amongst its pioneers.
 
 

India’s rapid digitisation of government services, however, has exacerbated the phenomenon described by Nordhaus. In perhaps what can be described as digital political business cycles, some politicians can now use digital payment systems to engage in ‘virtual vote buying’ by directly reaching voters just before elections.
In recent years, cash transfer schemes directed specifically at women are increasingly being used by all political parties to win elections in India. Despite waxing eloquent against the use of such tactics — ‘revdi culture’ — Modi’s party used women-oriented financial support schemes ahead of polls in Maharashtra last year.
In the most recent elections, Kumar announced pre-election schemes amounting to 3pc of GDP despite Bihar’s fiscal deficit at 6pc of GDP. Before polls opened, Kumar started sending INR 10,000 to one woman from each family, claiming that this was ‘seed money’ for small businesses such as bea­uty parlours, dairy units, tailoring and retail kiosks.
It goes without saying that with little oversight, and due to money’s fungibility, the amount was probably consumed immediately. Economists warn that such populist policies can create serious fiscal implications, with Bihar being forced to rely on additional debt financing to sustain such expenditures.
According to Indian political analyst Neerja Chowdhury, these cash transfers underpinned the election results in Bihar. The 2025 Bihar election saw a record overall voter turnout of 66.91pc, the highest since 1951.
 
 

This was driven by a landmark surge in female participation, where female turnout stood at 71.6pc — significantly outpacing male turnout (62.8pc) and marking a clear watershed from the 60.48pc and 59.69pc female turnouts of the previous two elections. In a sense, by directly doling out cash to voters, the BJP and its allies were able to encourage women to break from traditional loyalties of caste and identity.

To be sure, the BJP’s rivals in Bihar had also promised goodies — one government job for every family — if they were voted into office. In this case, however, voters did not consider these to be credible commitments as government job promises appeared too good to be true.
It appears that, as in India, Pakistan’s political parties are fully aware of the transformative political power of cash transfers. This is the reason why, despite being allies at the federal level, Pakistan’s two main political parties were recently at loggerheads.
After the recent floods, the PPP had asked the PML-N’s government in Punjab to provide flood relief through the PPP’s signature Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). Despite repeated requests, the PML-N resisted their federal ally’s demand with full force in the province, arguing that the amounts provided through the BISP were not enough to cover flood-related damage.
 
 

Meanwhile, BISP allocations have been rising steadily over the years. This year, the BISP allocation was increased by 20pc to Rs716 billion. The ability of cash transfers to tip the electoral scales in India, and Pakistani politicos’ cognisance of this phenomenon, does not bode well for Pakistan’s future fiscal management.
Where providing un­­conditional cash transfers to poor citizens is commendable, political competition may lead to exponential increases in BISP allocations in the future, especially as we get close to the next elections.
Back in India, there were multiple fatalities in a bomb blast near the Red Fort in Delhi the night before the second round of elections in Bihar. Though it is too early to trace a connection, this tragic incident may have also impacted electoral outcomes, especially in the aftermath of the Pakistan-India conflict earlier this year.
 
 

In a bid to highlight his strongman image, Modi repeatedly alluded to the Pakistan-India conflict on the campaign trail. Under fire from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi for “lacking courage”, the BJP even branded Gandhi the “poster boy of Pak­is­­tan”. Surprisingly, where the usually bellicose Indian media seems to have simmered down, Pak­istan keeps living rent-free in the BJP’s imagination.
In all likelihood, Modi’s victory in Bihar and the BJP’s strong political momentum for the upcoming state elections are going to embolden foreign policy hawks in India. This is especially so since India was unable to achieve any of its military or political objectives in the recent conflict with Pakistan.
The BJP’s surprising performance underscores its strategy for cementing power in different Indian states: direct cash transfers and a potent anti-Pakistan narrative. As the party seeks to maintain this momentum for upcoming state elections, Pakistani policymakers should be wary of runaway social spending, which could ultimately encroach on vital defence resources.

At a meeting of the ISIL and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee held recently at the UN Security Council, Denmark, in its position as the current chair of the committee, said that the banned TTP posed a “serious threat” to Central and South Asia, while pointing out that the terrorist group received “logistical and substantial support” from the Afghan authorities, namely the Taliban. The Danish representative also mentioned the frequent cross-border attacks that TTP terrorists have conducted against Pakistan, while alerting the international community to the threat that IS-K — also based in Afghanistan but opposed to its rulers — posed to the region.
The Pakistani representative used the forum to criticise both the Taliban and their newfound ally, India, when he observed that terrorist groups, including the TTP and BLA, were thriving “under the patronage of their hosts”, and were backed by “our principal adversary and net destabiliser in the region”.
 
 

While the Taliban are often dismissive of Pakistan’s concerns in this regard, it will be hard for them to brush aside the issues raised by the UN body. The sanctions committee has reaffirmed what Pakistan has been saying for long: that the Taliban are supporting the TTP, and that terrorist groups in Afghanistan can destabilise the entire region. The Afghan Taliban’s responses to these grave concerns have been ambiguous, from stating that the TTP are Pakistan’s problem, to claiming they are hosting Pakistani ‘refugees’, to saying that no TTP terrorist is based on their territory. As is evident, the international community is not buying the Taliban’s explanations.
Instead of displaying obduracy over the matter, the Kabul regime needs to work constructively with Pakistan to address the problem. The last round of peace talks held in Istanbul earlier this month ended inconclusively, though the ceasefire between both states has held. Though it would be overly idealistic to expect the Taliban to take strong action against the TTP — both groups are from the same ideological stock, and have fought together in Afghanistan — Pakistan’s demand that Kabul stop cross-border attacks is entirely doable.
 
 

The alternative to the Taliban’s dithering and denialism would be more conflict, which is not in the interest of either country. The Pakistani state, therefore, while taking a firm stand against cross-border terrorism and internal security, must not let bilateral and people-to-people ties nosedive further.
If ties with Kabul sour even more, inimical actors in the region will be ready to exploit these differences, which will only add to Pakistan’s security dilemmas.

• Umrani says Balochistan CM enjoys complete support of his party
QUETTA: Parliamentary leaders of both the PML-N and the PPP have dismissed reports of a change in Balochistan’s chief minister, saying Senator Mir Dostain Khan Domki’s claim had no basis and that CM Sarfraz Bugti continued to enjoy the full support of all coalition parties.
They said on Friday that this appeared to be a personal desire of PML-N’s Domki, as the central leaderships of both parties had not even considered this move, adding that no such proposal was under discussion.
Talking to reporters after the Balo­chistan Assembly session, Mir Saleem Khosa, the PML-N’s parliamentary leader and provincial minister for communication and works, said the statement of his party’s senator might be his personal opinion or due to some disagreements with CM Bugti.
 
 

He noted that Balochistan faced serious law and order as well as governance issues, and these matters had been reviewed during the in-camera briefing held in the assembly.
Mr Khosa said after Mr Domki’s statement, he spoke with National As­­sembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and the PML-N central leadership wou­ld certainly question the senator about issuing such remarks without the permission of the party leadership.
“Personal disagreements may occur, but statements against party policy are inappropriate,” Mr Khosa added.
He said the PML-N had nothing to do with the PPP’s internal matters, noting that every party had its own issues and that disagreements could arise even within families.
“Differences between MPAs and the chief minister are normal, and that their own party [PPP] members also raise concerns, which are addressed through dialogue.”
The PML-N parliamentary leader said Mr Bugti was working efficiently and tirelessly, and that the coalition government stood firmly behind him
“The PML-N will continue supporting Chief Minister Bugti under all circumstances. Balochistan faces serious challenges, including external threats, but the situation is gradually improving,” Mr Khosa remarked.
‘PPP leadership backs Bugti’
PPP parliamentary leader Mir Muhammad Sadiq Umrani also refuted Senator Domki’s claim, saying that CM Bugti enjoyed his party leadership’s complete confidence and would continue to serve as the chief executive of the province.
“No individual, who is not a member of the PPP, has the authority to issue policy statements about the party,” Mr Umrani said. He said the PPP had already decided that Mr Bugti was their chief minister and would remain so.
Mr Umrani said he could not comment on future political developments, but added that the party leadership had directed him to reject the rumours about a change of chief minister, which he had done.
 
 

He said the decision on the remaining two and a half years of the power-sharing arrangement rests with the party leadership. “The PPP believes the next two and a half years will also belong to them,” he said.
To a question, he said he had remained a part of the PPP for 53 years. “People come and go, but they remain steadfast with the party,” he added.

A source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Mr Kundi and gave signals that the government has no intention of removing him.
The discussion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal also attended.
A few days ago, the governor denied reports about his removal but said he would “accept whatever the decision will be by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
The issue of imposing governor’s rule was also discussed, reportedly due to a rigid stance by KP’s newly elected Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.
 
 

Earlier, the prime minister directed relevant ministries to accelerate the integration of private-sector proposals into a unified industrial policy.
“The government seeks to translate expert recommendations into actionable reforms without delay,” he said while presiding over a meeting of a private-sector committee on industrial development.
PM Shehbaz welcomed proposals from the business community aimed at increasing investment.
“The business community has diligently prepared comprehensive proposals for industrial development, which are commendable,” he said, adding that an implementation plan would be formulated after a careful review.
He instructed that the proposals should be merged with recommendations from other economic sectors.
Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Jam Kamal Khan, Ahad Khan Cheema, Ali Pervaiz Malik, Advi­sor to the PM Muh­am­­mad Ali, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special As­­sistant Haroon Akhtar, and ind­ustrialists included in the Indu­s­trial Working Group led by Saqib Shirazi attended the meeting.

• Security personnel authorised to act as magistrates for offences
ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry on Friday approved the deployment of the Pakistan Army and civil armed forces for security in 13 national and provincial assembly constituencies, where by-elections are scheduled to take place on Sunday (tomorrow).
A notification issued by the interior ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said the approval followed requests from Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The civil armed forces will be deployed as “2nd-tier responders (standby/quick reaction)”, while the troops of Pakistan Army will be deployed as “3rd-tier responders (quick reaction force)” from Friday to Nov 24 (Monday).
The civil armed forces will be deployed as “second-tier responders (standby/quick reaction),” whereas the troops of the Pakistan Army will serve as “third-tier responders (quick reaction force)” from Friday through Nov 24 (Monday).
The exact numbers will be determined by home departments and the ECP based on ground assessments.
The constituencies where the by-elections are taking place include NA-18 Haripur, NA-96 Faisal­ab­ad-II, NA-104 Faisalabad-X, NA-143 Sahiwal-III, NA-185 D.G Khan-II, NA-129 Lahore-XIII, PP-73 Sar­go­dha-III, PP-98 Faisalabad-I, PP-115 Faisalabad-XVIII, PP-116 Faisal­abad-XIX, PP-203 Sahi­wal-VI, PP-269 Muzaffar­garh-II, and PP-87 Mianwali-III.
ECP notification
A separate notification issued by the ECP stated that, under Article 218(3) of the Constitution, the commission was responsible for organising and conducting elections and ensuring that they were held honestly, fairly, and in accordance with the law, with safeguards against corrupt practices.
“The ECP, in exercise of its power under Article 220 of the Constitution and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, has requisitioned the services of Pakistan armed forces/civil armed forces in terms of Article 245 of the Constitution,” it read.
“The forces so deployed are empowered to exercise powers under section 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, for the duration of their deployment … in aid of civil power subject to law enforced in Pakistan,” it added.
The statement continued that the ECP under Article 220 of the Cons­ti­tution — read with Section 5 and Sec­­­tion 193 of the Elections Act, 2017 (XXIII of 2017) — has also auth­orised each designated officer in charge of Pakistan armed forces and civil armed forces as well as junior commissioned officer, to exercise the powers of a magistrate first class during their deployment for security.
They may take cognisance of offences under sections 176, 177, 183 and 194 of the Elections Act and conduct summary trials under Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

• Israeli military admits to killing 13 Palestinians in a Lebanon refugee camp
JERUSALEM: Israeli occupation forces killed at least eight Palestinians on Friday, including two teenagers who were shot dead in the occupied West Bank, while the Israeli military also confirmed it had killed 13 Palestinians in its Tuesday’s strike on a refugee camp in southern Lebanon.
The Palestinian health ministry said that two teenagers were martyred overnight in the town of Kufr Aqab. “The young man Amr Khaled Ahmed Al-Marbou, 18, and the boy Sami Ibrahim Sami Mashayekh, 16, were martyred by occupation forces’ gunfire in the town of Kufr Aqab near Ramallah,” the ministry announced in a statement.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its medics transported two victims from Kufr Aqab during the night, describing one with a “very serious live bullet injury” and the second with a “live bullet injury to the chest.”
 


Oday al-Shurfa, a friend who witnessed the killing of Marbou, told AFP that the pair were on the street when Israeli forces opened fire during a raid. He said Israeli soldiers shot them without provocation.
Shurfa stated that Marbou was hit “in the chest, in the heart. He collapsed and was martyred on the spot,” insisting his friend was not participating in any clashes or throwing stones.
 
 

The town of Kufr Aqab, though technically part of illegally annexed east Jerusalem, is cut off by Israel’s separation wall, depriving its residents of basic municipal services from either Jerusalem or the Palestinian Authority.
In the besieged southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said its forces killed five Palestinians on Friday. The killings took place in an area of southern Gaza under Israeli military control, east of the so-called Yellow Line.
Israeli military used “immediate threat” to justify the killings. The same pretext has been repeatedly used by the Israeli military to legitimise its brutality, even as Palestinian resistance groups have affirmed a halt to their activities in Gaza since a ceasefire was announced.
Separately, a Gaza hospital official told AFP that another Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire near Khan Yunis.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military confirmed on Friday that its strike on the Ain al-Helweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon earlier in the week killed 13 Palestinians, whom it claimed were “Hamas terrorists.”

• Dollar sales to banks drop to $3bn in 10 months
KARACHI: The country has lost an estimated $600 million to illegal crypto transactions, a development that has sharply reduced the flow of dollars into the banking system as people buy dollars from exchange companies and route them into cryptocurrencies through unlawful channels.
“Last year, during the first 10 months of the calendar year, we sold banks about $4 billion, which fell to $3 billion during the same period this year. These disappeared dollars were mostly invested in crypto currencies,” said Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan.
 
 

He said people buying dollars from exchange companies are depositing them in their foreign currency (FCY) accounts, from where they withdraw the dollars and purchase cryptocurrencies through illegal means. During Jan-October this year, Pakistanis retained about $400m in their FCY accounts, while $600m left the country with no trace.
The State Bank recently issued a circular instructing both banks and exchange companies not to provide cash dollars; instead, they must transfer the amount directly into the customer’s FCY account for deposit purposes.
Exchange companies now either issue cheques or directly transfer funds into customers’ FCY accounts. Mr Malik said these deposited dollars are then withdrawn from banks’ FCY accounts and invested in cryptocurrencies.
Dollar sales to banks also dropped during the first four months of the current fiscal year, despite tight controls on borders with Afghanistan and Iran. Data shows that exchange companies sold $280m in July this year ($333m in 2024); $163m in August ($295m in 2024); $186m in September ($214m in 2024); and $244m in October ($297m in 2024). Total sales to banks during July-Oct 2024 were $1.139 billion, which fell to $873m in the first four months of 2025 — a decline of 23 per cent.
State Bank data shows that commercial banks’ dollar holdings increased from $4.180bn in January 2025 to $4.625bn, an increase of $425m.
The country has faced a serious shortage of dollars for years and was close to default in 2023. After receiving an IMF bailout, the government and the State Bank imposed restrictions on imports to reduce trade and current account deficits, while launching a crackdown on illegal trading and dollar smuggling. Illegal trading is now largely under control, but this new trend of crypto investments could undermine policymakers’ efforts to save dollars and reduce reliance on foreign exchange loans.
Meanwhile, the government is preparing to enter the international financial market with new bonds, as well as the Chinese market with Panda Bonds. Currently, the State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves stand at about $14.551bn, and the bank expects reserves to reach $17bn by the end of FY26.
Higher remittance inflows have allowed the central bank to make payments for debt servicing and other obligations while still maintaining more than $14.5bn in reserves.
Currency experts believe the IMF will release the expected $1.2 billion, which would further boost the SBP’s reserves.

• Can’t let ‘our people be killed indiscriminately’
• Scheduling of planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with Pak-Afghan conflict still awaited
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
“The onus of delay in the reopening of the border crossings rests with the Afghan Taliban regime,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at a weekly media briefing.
Pakistan and Afghanistan’s bilateral trade, estimated at $1.6 billion to $1.8bn in 2023-24, with key border gateways like Torkham and Chaman handling most of the traffic, has been suspended since mid-October, following deadly clashes between Pakistani forces and Taliban fighters.
This suspension is estimated to be costing Afghan traders an estimated $2.5 million a day.
 


The impasse has pushed Kabul to increasingly rely on Iranian routes, including Chabahar, while risking the erosion of Pakistan’s roughly $1bn in annual transit fees in addition to its own trade losses.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had closed border crossings and suspended all trade because of “the support being extended to Fitna-al-Khawarij [FAK] and Fitna-al-Hindustan [FAH] terrorist elements by the Afghan Taliban regime”.
FAK is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­i­stan, while the Balochistan Liberation Army and other militant groups based in the province have been designated FAH to highlight India’s alle­ged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
‘Economic pain’
The FO spokesperson said Islamabad understood the economic pain caused by the closures but described the security threat as “existential”.
“If you recall, on November 10 and 15, the trade posts were actually attacked from Afghanistan. So, either we get ourselves killed, or we undertake a very risky trade. What is the choice?” he added.
“Carrying out trade has become risky. So, with respect to trade, the position remains the same as I outlined last week.”
Mr Andrabi said Islamabad had for years attempted to insulate trade from security tensions but that patience had run out.
“From 2022, 23, 24 and the mid of 25, we segregated trade and security. But then there is a threshold of patience. I think that threshold of patience has been crossed,” he continued.
 
 

The FO spokesperson noted that Islamabad could not allow trade to continue as if it were a “licence to kill Pakistanis from Afghan soil”.
He rejected suggestions that trade losses should override security concerns. “Can you put a price tag on a human life, a Pakistani life?” he said.
“Consider the people whose father, children, mother have been killed in these terrorist attacks. Can we convince them that look, let these killings continue because we are having an X amount of dollars of trade with Afghanistan?”
Regional projects
He also warned that major regional infrastructure projects including the Turkmen­istan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline and the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) depended on a shift in the Taliban’s conduct.
“The success of all these projects also depends on the Taliban regime halting its support and abetment of terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil,” he said.
Calling this a central “denominator” of ties, Mr Andrabi said the Afghan Taliban must stop backing groups such as FAK, FAH and their affiliates, and prevent Afghan nationals from carrying out attacks inside Pakistan.
“We are cognisant of the losses to Pakistani traders, who are suffering,” he said. “But now we cannot let our people be killed indiscriminately.”
Turkish delegation
The spokesperson said the scheduling of a planned Turkish delegation’s visit in connection with the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan conflict was still awaited, despite Ankara’s announcement earlier this month that senior officials would travel to Islamabad for renewed mediation efforts.
The third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, held under the Turkish-Qatari initiative, ended without an agreement on Nov 7 in Istanbul, leaving the ceasefire fragile amid continued TTP attacks.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced on Nov 9 that a high-level delegation, including Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad the following week to help secure a lasting ceasefire and work towards reopening trade routes.
Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
“This visit has not taken place. It is being scheduled. The travel schedules of ministers take time to firm up,” Mr Andrabi said.
 
 

He rejected suggestions that Islam­abad’s lack of cooperation was causing delays.“The delay should not be attributed to any non-cooperation from Pakistan,” he said.“Whether there is any non-cooperation from the Afghan Tali­ban regime, I am not aware of it.”
The FO spokesperson said it was premature to comment on other mediation proposals, including those from Russia and Iran.
“Many states have offered mediation, and we appreciate the support of our friendly and brotherly countries,” he said.
“It is too early to comment on any specifics or other mediation offers. We will respond once we receive them.”

• Provinces, Centre to give 10-minute briefings on fiscal positions
• Terms of reference cover distribution of five key federal tax categories
• Commission to debate cost-sharing for provincial, national, transnational projects
• PM expected to engage with leadership of key allies before formal sitting
ISLAMABAD: After yet another rescheduling, the federal government has convened the inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) on Dec 4 to set the housekeeping framework for subsequent technical, financial and legal discussions on horizontal and vertical resource sharing among the federating units.
According to notices sent to the provinces, the first NFC meeting, to be presided over by Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, will take up three agenda items. It will begin with general discussions on “strategy for deliberations on the 11th NFC award, including proposed formation of sub-groups for deliberations on thematic areas, etc”.
This will be followed by 10-minute presentations each by the four provincial governments and the Ministry of Finance on their respective fiscal positions. The commission will finally set the schedule and timelines for future NFC meetings, most likely to be held in all federal and provincial capitals, until the conclusion of its deliberations.
 
 

Sources told Dawn that the finance ministry had earlier issued notices to the provinces for the first meeting on Dec 3 along with the agenda, but the date was changed the same day to Dec 4.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to finalise a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
The first meeting was originally scheduled for Aug 27, then delayed to Aug 29 for unspecified reasons. This, too, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government due to flood-related engagements. The session was later rescheduled for Nov 17, then Nov 18, and again deferred at the desire of the Prime Minister’s Office.
Headed by Finance Minister Aura­n­gzeb, the NFC comprises the four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
The terms of reference set out in Clause 2 of Article 160 require the commission to recommend the distribution of the net proceeds from five major tax categories between the federation and the provinces. These include taxes on income, including capital value tax and corporation tax, but excluding taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund.
Also on the list are taxes on the sale and purchase of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed; export duties on cotton and such other export duties as may be specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes as may be specified by the president.
The notification also seeks to make recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces.
The new NFC is also required to deliberate issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation in respect of subjects falling within the provincial domain; expenditure sharing by the federation and/or the provinces in respect of transnational matters; and financial requirements for national projects to be jointly funded by the Centre and the provinces.
 
 

In line with suggestions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Centre wants to secure provincial burden-sharing in expenses for increasingly frequent natural calamities, certain horizontal health programmes and major dams, highways and motorways. It has also been calling for an end to the existing population-based incentive and its replacement with criteria based on social-sector performance and the activation of local governments.
The NFC will also be required to recommend grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, set out the powers and conditions governing federal and provincial borrowing, and assess and allocate resources to meet expenditures related to the governments of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).
Under the 7th NFC award, announced in 2009 and enforced for 15 years rather than the five-year constitutional term, the provincial share in the divisible pool was raised to 57.5pc from about 47pc. This later increased to around 59pc after special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh on various grounds, reducing the federal share to 42.5pc.
In subsequent years, however, the Centre imposed a petroleum levy of about Rs1.5 trillion and secured roughly Rs1.5tr in cash balances from the provinces, effectively tilting the financial balance back in its favour.
On their part, the provinces failed to meet their 7th NFC commitment to increase their own revenue contribution by 0.5pc of GDP every year. A similar pledge by the Centre to raise its revenue by one per cent of GDP annually also remained unfulfilled.
For the current year, the federal government has already revised down its economic growth forecast by up to 0.7 percentage points to 3.5pc owing to flood-related damages.
Various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces and the IMF, have been calling for a rebalancing of the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources in the Centre’s favour.
The Constitution, however, stipulates that provincial shares under each NFC award cannot be reduced. The award must be agreed upon by consensus among the five parties, i.e., the Centre and the four provinces.
Provincial governments receive their horizontal shares based on population, poverty, revenue collection and inverse population density. Under the current formula, Punjab receives 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to engage with the political leadership of key allies on the NFC before the formal sitting, although he has no official role in the commission, the sources said.
The revision of NFC parameters was originally part of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, under which the Centre sought to reduce provincial shares and take back some devolved subjects such as education and population.
However, the federal government later stepped back in a political bargain with its main coalition partner, the PPP, to prioritise amendments relating to the armed forces and the judiciary. Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing dialogue with the PPP on the NFC.

FCCP Registrar Muhammad Hafeezullah Khan inaugurated the desk on the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC). “The establishment of this desk marks a significant step toward enhancing public facilitation and improving access to judicial services,” says a handout issued by FCCP.
At the inauguration, the desk received two fresh cases, marking the commencement of its operational functions.
The desk has been established to serve multiple purposes, including filing of new cases for FCCP, providing information and assistance to litigants, lawyers and the general public and receiving applications for attested copies of judicial records.
 
 

Before the setting up of the information desk, the lawyers were facing difficulty since they had no idea where to file petitions or appeals.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who graced the inauguration, acknowledged the initiative as a historical milestone in strengthening judicial outreach and administrative efficiency.
The FCCP also issued an official notification regarding the court’s working hours, ensuring clarity and accessibility for all stakeholders. It stated the federal court was committed to improving service delivery, transparency and ease of access for litigants across the country.
The appeal against the SHC in a family property dispute was filed by Ghulam Shah Abbasi in person, seeking prevention of harassment and protection of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
The appellant pleaded before the federal court to set aside the Sept 8 decision of the SHC that had disposed of the case on the grounds that the matter pertained to a private civil dispute. He also requested the FCCP to order the Sindh government for providing due protection and restrain his family members from harassment and bodily harm.
The matter revolves around a family dispute over inherited properties left by deceased father of the petitioner, which is a three-storey residential building with shops in Hyderabad.
The petitioner claimed that he asked for his legal share in the inherited properties left behind by his deceased father Noor Muhammad Abbasi who died on July 22, 2003 but the family members became his enemy, which according to him was the root cause of dispute.
The appellant claimed that he was “deceitfully” called by the respondent relatives at Hyderabad for settlement and giving his share from the inherited properties left by his deceased father but when he reached at Citizen Colony Gate at Hyderabad he was allegedly abducted and later tied up and illegally confined for 15 days in the Drugs Addicted Ward of M/s MK (Majnu Khan) Hospital allegedly to “fabricate and generate” his false statement.
He also alleged that he was being intimidated and harassed by the Commissioner, Sindh Revenue Board, Karachi. On April 29, 2024, the appellant said, a complaint was lodged with Arambagh police station.

RESCUERS search for survivors after an explosion at a chemical factory.—Courtesy Rescue 1122

• Factory owner, staff held
• Probe body formed on CM’s directive
• Labour unions blame govt
TOBA TEK SINGH: Twenty people, including seven members of the same family, lost their lives and seven others were injured in a massive steamer explosion apparently due to gas leak at a glue factory in Faisalabad on early Friday morning.
The explosion at the Crystal Chemical Factory also destroyed four neighbouring industrial units and nine houses in the Malikpur locality of Faisalabad.
Rescue workers and police shifted the dece­ased and the injured, incl­uding three critically inj­ured, to the burn unit of Allied Hosp­ital. The victims aged between one year and 62 years, according to officials.
In the meantime, the crime-scene unit and forensic unit of police collected evidence from the site, while the factory owner, Qaiser Chughtai, along with administrative staff allegedly went into hiding for some time.
 
 

While expressing grief over the loss of lives, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif extended condolences to the bereaved families and sought a report on the incident from Com­missioner Raja Jahangir Anwar.
Subsequently, the commissioner formed a five-member inquiry committee and sought a report to determine responsibility for the incident.
Govt negligence blamed
National Trade Union Federation Secretary-Gen­eral Nasir Mansoor, Labour Qaumi Movement Chairman Baba Latif Ans­ari, and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party Chief Farooq Tariq, in separate statements, blamed the government negligence for loss of lives.
While expressing concern over the tragic deaths of labourers and citizens, they said the government was responsible for negligence that allowed factory owners to endanger the lives of workers and residents by failing to adopt safety measures.
Owner held, FIR registered
Later, the Mansoorabad police arrested the factory owner and registered a case against him and others under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Pakistan Penal Code and Explosive Substances Act on a complaint of Sub-Inspector Ehtesham Abbas.
According to police, factory owner Qaiser Chughtai, manager Bilal Ali Imran, and six others were booked in the case, which was registered under Section 7 of the ATA; Sections 302, 324, 336-B, 440, 147, and 149 of the PPC, and Sections 3 and 4 of the Explosive Substances Act.
Later, factory manager Bilal Ali Imran, cook Khalid, and two workers, Zain and Atta Muhammad, were also taken into custody.
 
 

The FIR alleged that residents had repeatedly warned the factory owner and management not to store dangerous flammable chemicals in the factory, but the management continued to store them while throwing caution to wind.
The roofs of four factories — including the glue factory — and nine houses in the adjacent Shahab Town collapsed due to the powerful blast.
Victims identified
According to police, 20 people died in the incident. Most of them have been identified. It also stated that seven others were injured.
The deceased included seven members of the same family namely Shafiq, 62, his wife, Maqsooda, 55, their son Irfan, grandchildren Muqaddas, 13, Rehan, 12, Muhammad Ahmed, 10, and Azan, 4.
Also, electrical engineer Ashiq Hussain, and his three sons Obaid, 24, Omar, 22, and Bilal, 20, died under the debris when the roof of their house collapsed.
Residents of the same street, Rashid’s wife Fakhra, 40, their one-year-old son, Ali Hasnain, and two daughters Maham, 4 and Jannat, 3, also died under the rubble. The two brothers who died in the nearby embroidery factory, Waqas, 25, and Saim, 23, were residents of Shamsabad locality on Chak Jhumra Road. A worker of the affected factory, Fazal, also died.

The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-built Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Videos circulating on social media showed the aircraft failing to recover from an aerial maneuver and bursting into a ball of flames after impacting the ground as onlookers watched in shock. A plume of smoke billowed from the crash site as emergency vehicles sped towards it.
The incident happened on the last day of the Middle East’s biggest airshow, which features a flying display each afternoon. Hundreds of people were watching from a grandstand, while the apron was packed with planes, helicopters and other hardware on static display.
In September, India signed a $7 billion order for 97 upgraded Tejas Mk1A fighter jets to replace its Russian MiG-21 fleet after decades of use.
In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident.
 






“An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added.
Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site.
The UAE aviation authority was not immediately available to comment on whether it would lead a local investigation. The Indian embassy said it was in touch with UAE authorities. Experts stressed it was too early to say what caused the crash.
GE, the engine manufacturer, said in a statement that it was ready to support the investigation.
‘Oil leak’ controversy
Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with posts claiming that the Indian fighter jet was ‘leaking oil’ while parked on the tarmac. Pictures showed shopping bags placed beneath the Tejas to collect the leaking liquid.
Some posts claimed the leak continued on the second day of the international air show. However, there was no official comment on the topic by the Indian government or the armed forces.
The Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India, in a post, claimed that it was a “routine draining process, not a technical malfunction”.
The bureau added that it was part of the “standard pre-flight procedure to remove condensation, which naturally forms as part of the aircraft’s cooling system”.
 






The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The aircraft has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy.
 






The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21.
The show, according to its website, brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries.
India had been gauging interest from potential foreign buyers at the week-long airshow, a major arena for global arms and airliner markets and well-known for bold displays making use of wide vistas of airspace.
Friday’s accident was the first on record for the world’s third-largest airshow, after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough. Airshow accidents were common in the 1970s, but have become rare at the top aerospace events as safety restrictions were tightened in recent decades.
This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024.
The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan.
The IAF expects to operate a fleet of almost 220 Tejas fighters and its advanced Mk-1A variants over the next decade after HAL completes the pending orders.
The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement that a joint intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in the Pahar Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, conducted by security forces and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, ten khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
The CTD said in their statement earlier today that two key commanders were among the terrorists killed in the IBO, which was launched at 7:30am.
“During the operation, 10 terrorists were killed, including two key commanders of the Teepo Gul group: Commander Niaz Ali, known as Akasha and Commander Abdullah, known as Shipunkoi,” the CTD said, adding that five terrorists were wounded, and one facilitator was arrested in the IBO.
In a separate IBO conducted in Dera Ismail Khan district, three terrorists were killed by security forces, according to ISPR.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from [the] killed Indian sponsored khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians,” the military’s media wing said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Earlier this week, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate IBOs conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-21 16:49</small></div><hr>
