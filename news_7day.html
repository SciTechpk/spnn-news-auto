The municipal administrations in cities and towns made special arrangements for the disposal of offal and other post-qurbani solid waste during the three days of Eidul Azha, and to ensure cleanliness.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.
They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in the nation’s behaviour.
In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.
“He called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,” Radio Pakistan said.
 
 

He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. “Along with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.”
Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other’s sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz said, “The message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.
“As our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.”
He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.
PM Shehbaz continued, “Today, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.”
He added: “Likewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.”
The prime minister, along with former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, offered prayers in Lahore’s Model Town.

Mardan District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi confirmed the casualties and told Dawn.com, “The explosion was caused by a gas cylinder.”
The spokesperson for KP Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmad Faizi said that a cylinder explosion in Mardan’s Aram Colony caused the roof of a two-story house to collapse. He said, “Six people were killed and two girls were seriously injured in the accident.”
He added that the rescue teams reached the site as soon as they received information about an alleged explosion inside the house.
Rescue 1122 teams continued rescue operations and rescued eight people, including a woman and children, buried under the rubble, he said.
Mardan Deputy Commissioner Azmatullah Wazir, District Emergency Officer Syed Shoaib Mansoor and Assistant Commissioner Junaid Khalid were present at the scene and supervised the entire operation, he added.
He also said that over a hundred Rescue 1122 personnel participated and completed the operation in seven hours, removing the dead and injured people and transferring them to the Mardan Medical Complex.
Incidents of fire caused by leakage and explosion of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders occur routinely across the country.
Following an LPG tanker explosion in Punjab’s Multan earlier this year that killed at least 19 and injured over a dozen others, the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Cabinet Sec­re­tariat ordered a probe into the sale of adulterated LPG.
In February, twelve people were injured after a gas cylinder exploded in a roadside cafe near the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) in Peshawar, a rescue official said.</p><small>2025-06-07 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/07142533414133e.jpg?r=142631' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915981/iran-says-us-travel-ban-reflects-racist-mentality' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says US travel ban reflects ‘racist mentality’</strong></a><br><p>Tehran denounced on Saturday the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, saying Washington’s decision was a sign of a “racist mentality”.
US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday an executive order reviving sweeping restrictions that echo his first-term travel ban, justified on national security grounds following a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado.
Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, called the measure, which takes effect June 9, “a clear sign of the dominance of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers”.
The decision “indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people”, he added in a statement released by the ministry.
Apart from Iran, the US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. A partial ban was imposed on travellers from seven other countries.
Hashemi-Raja said the policy “violates fundamental principles of international law” and deprives “hundreds of millions of people of the right to travel based solely on their nationality or religion”.
The foreign ministry official said that the ban was discriminatory and would “entail international responsibility for the US government”, without elaborating.
Iran and the US severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and relations have remained deeply strained since.
The United States is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran.
According to figures from Tehran’s foreign ministry, in 2020 there were some 1.5 million Iranians in the United States.
Trump’s executive order came days after Sunday’s attack at the Colorado rally, in which authorities said more than a dozen people were hurt. The suspect is an Egyptian man who had overstayed a tourist visa.</p><small>2025-06-07 09:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/071145330b28623.gif?r=114636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915842/hrcp-seeks-judicial-inquiry-into-may-20-moro-violence' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP seeks judicial inquiry into May 20 Moro violence</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an immediate and independent judicial inquiry into events surrounding May 20 protest in Moro, Naushahro Feroze district.
Given the incident occurred in the constituency of provincial home minister and political rivals had been named in FIRs as the police-protester confrontation had reportedly resulted in multiple injuries on both sides and fatalities among protesters, the commission questioned impartiality of the police-led investigation announced by Sindh IGP, said a press release issued by HRCP on Saturday.
“We therefore urge the Sindh government to announce an independent judicial inquiry without delay to establish the facts, ensure accountability and uphold rights of all citizens involved,” it said.
It said that an HRCP fact-finding mission had visited Moro to investigate the events that unfolded after the demonstrations erupted along National Highway against proposed construction of canals on Indus River and allocation of land for corporate farming projects.
 






According to community testimonies, the protest led by local residents, including members of Hari Mazdoor Ittehad group, was peaceful until police resorted to violent means.
One protester, Irfan Laghari, was critically injured and later died in a Hyderabad hospital. His family maintained he had no affiliation with any nationalist groups and had been demonstrating peacefully. Shortly after the confrontation, Lanjar House — residence of Sindh home minister — was set on fire.
 
 

According to Laghari’s family, private individuals armed with heavy weapons, reportedly deployed to protect the house, had opened fire. Zahid, who was not participating in the protest but happened to be nearby on personal business, was allegedly shot in the head and later succumbed to his injuries. He was 27 years old and his wife was currently expecting their first child, said the family.
The mission visited Goth Bajrani Laghari, the victim’s village, where they recorded statements of the families of the deceased, local journalists and teachers and attempted to meet police officials at Moro police station, but the station house officer declined to comment, stating that only SSP could speak on the matter.
The SSP could not be contacted on account of suspended cellular services. The team visited Lanjar House, but no one agreed to meet them.
The mission was informed that over 400 individuals had allegedly been falsely implicated in criminal and terrorism cases and that dozens — including political workers — had either been arrested or had been missing [since then].
In several cases, first information reports (FIRs) had been registered in districts far from Moro, including Shikarpur and Mirpurkhas.
The FIR for arson at Lanjar House named senior opposition figures. Since May 20, mobile services in the area had remained suspended and a visible police presence continued to create an atmosphere of fear among residents, it said.

Major parts of the metropolis continue to face worsening water shortages as the city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) gets only 650MGD.
Besides, line losses and theft also affect the water supply, leaving a large number of people with a severe shortage of water.
Although the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation announced that water tanker service will continue during the Eid holidays, people relying on the service will have to take extra precautions to minimise the impact as hardly 15MGD water is supplied through tankers across the city.

KWSC says round-the-clock tanker service to continue to overcome shortage

According to the water utility officials, there are over 3,500 registered water tankers which get water from seven hydrants in as many districts of the city for supply to citizens.
The water tankers’ operators said that the number of the water tankers supplying water from the hydrants would be remarkably low during the Eid holidays as many tanker drivers had already left for their hometowns for the festival.
 
 

Due to persistent water shortages across the city people mostly rely on water tankers. They, however, face a great deal of hardship to get it as the water utility receive more bookings than the quota of water reserved for each district.
Muhammad Umair, resident of North Karachi, said that he had been trying to get a water tanker for the past three days, but in vain.
“Every time I am told to wait for my turn, which never comes,” he lamented.
Residents also complained that the “tanker mafia” did not provide them water tanker on the official price and always overcharged them.
A good number of small pick-up, donkey carts and pushcarts, laden with water tanks, are also operating in many densely-populate localities of low-income neighbourhoods and selling water at the prices of their choice.
A mason living in Baldia Town said that the he got water through a pushcart and was using it very economically as he could not afford to pay for a proper water tanker. “I will take bath after a week on Eid day,” he added.
A spokesman for the water utility claimed that the regular water supply and tanker services would continue without interruption during the Eid holidays.
He said that the decision was taken to ensure smooth and timely water supply to citizens during the festive period.
Hydrants Cell In-charge Muhammad Siddiq Tunio said that all online booking users would be provided timely delivery of water tankers throughout Eid.
He said all scheduled leaves of tanker drivers and hydrants cell staff had been cancelled to ensure that the service remained fully operational during Eid.
Meanwhile, residents of Azizabad staged a protest against the KWSC for failing to provide water in their locality.
Published in Dawn, June 7th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-07 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/07102848398908e.jpg?r=102954' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915905/positive-triggers-continue-to-drive-bullish-momentum-at-psx' target='_blank'><strong>Positive triggers continue to drive bullish momentum at PSX</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A series of positive triggers continued to drive bullish momentum at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which scaled an all-time high in two record-setting sessions, thanks to the improved economic outlook in the outgoing short week, settling for the first time above the 121,000 barrier.
The optimism following the government’s finalised agreements for a historic loan package of Rs1.275 trillion with approximately 18 commercial banks to address circular debt sent the benchmark index to new highs. The other key positive development was the approval of $800 million loan by the Asian Development Bank under Pakistan’s public finance programme.
 
 

In May, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, saw a significant increase, rising to 3.5pc from a record low of 0.3pc in April. This sudden spike could be a major concern for investors, as it may halt the ongoing trend of interest rate cuts by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The current momentum suggests that the KSE-100 index may be poised to test the 125,000 level in the near term. However, a decisive and sustained close above the 121,000 mark, a key technical resistance, will be critical to confirm the continuation of this bullish trend.
AKD Securities Ltd said the market continued its bullish momentum throughout the week, driven primarily by investor confidence ahead of the upcoming budget. Overall, the opinion on the street remains that a stable fiscal environment is necessary to continue, with no significant shift in existing tax structures for individuals and businesses alike.
Reflecting this optimism, the benchmark KSE 100 index surged by 1,950 points or 1.6pc to close at 121,641 points week-on-week.  However, market participation fell, with the average daily traded volume falling by 0.2pc to 660 million shares, down from 662 million shares in the preceding week.
On the macroeconomic front, the trade deficit stood at $2.6bn for May. Regarding sectoral developments, cement offtake reached 4.65 million tonnes in May, up 9pc year-on-year, driven by higher domestic demand.
Cement sales are likely to grow by 6pc year-on-year in FY26, primarily due to a pickup in construction activities supported by declining interest rates and a lower inflationary environment. Meanwhile, OMC industry offtake showed an inclining trend as well, clocking in at 1.53m tonnes, up 10pc year-on-year.
The rupee depreciated by 0.05pc against the greenback to Rs282.17.
Other major news developments during the week included Pakistani officials meeting with US trade authorities next week; the IMF and Pakistan nearing a consensus on a cut in tax rates for the salaried class, with a plan to hike interest rates on income from bank deposits by 2pc and the government aiming for 4.2pc growth in FY26.
Sector-wise, power generation and distribution, textile weaving, modarabas, leasing companies and investment banks and companies were amongst the top performers. On the other hand, vanaspati and allied industries, synthetic rayon, transport, cable and electrical goods and paper and board were amongst the worst performers.
Flow-wise, major net selling was recorded by Foreigners and mutual funds, with net sales of $ 14.7m and $ 11.4m, respectively. On the other hand, companies absorbed most of the selling with a net buy of $8.6m.
AKD Securities expects budget-related developments to influence short-term market sentiment. The potential for single-digit interest rates may contribute to a favourable outlook over time.
The KSE-100 Index is expected to continue its upward trend, aiming for a target of 165,215 points by the end of December.

The draft resolution vetoed by the solitary US vote received 14 in favour. It also called for the “immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave”, said a UN release.
In what appeared to be a move coordinated with the veto, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the US was sanctioning four judges of the International Court of Justice for ‘targeting’ with arrest warrants Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier, the US had sanctioned the ICJ prosecutor for the same ‘crime’.
These US actions came as the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, described Gaza as “worse than hell on earth”. In an interview to the BBC at the ICRC Headquarters in Geneva, she said “humanity is failing” as it watched the horrors of the Gaza war.

The systematic destruction of any and all infrastructure that supports human life is near complete.

Israel’s policy, backed by its US-led Western allies and the acquiescence of the regional Arab governments, has always been aimed at the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, and its governing coalition leaders have been unequivocal in explicitly stating their military objectives.
The systematic destruction of any and all infrastructure that supports human life is near complete, with water, power, homes, schools, universities and even hospitals bombed to rubble. Of the number of functioning hospitals in Gaza, only two remain.
 
 

The UN has called for the protection of these last two hospitals, particularly providing emergency services to the Strip, which is being bombed and hit by missiles daily, causing dozens of casualties, young and old. The UN also says the percentage of malnourished children is rising by the day.
This malnourishment is due to the Israeli food blockade on Gaza. Israel has brushed aside all aid organisations’ protestations to introduce its own ‘food distribution’ points, where dozens of starving Palestinians, including women, have been killed by Israeli tank-mounted machinegun fire.
The Conservative member of the UK parliament, Kit Malthouse, defied his party’s pro-Israel policy to offer the most apt description of what is happening. Speaking in the Commons, he said Gaza has become “an abattoir where starving people are lured out through combat zones to be shot at”.
“If the situation were reversed, we would now be mobilising the British armed forces as part of an international protection force,” Mr Malthouse said, exposing Western hypocrisy and his own government’s inaction.
Adding another twist to the food crisis in Gaza is the Israeli prime minister’s confirmation — after Israeli defence sources had earlier told local journalists that accusations made by the opposition politician Avigdor Lieberman were correct — about the arming of a group that many believe comprises criminals.
Mr Lieberman, according to the BBC, told the state broadcaster that the prime minister had unilaterally approved the arming of the Abu Shabab clan and transferred weapons to it. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with the Islamic State group.”
Sources in the know say the group is led by Yasser Abu Shahab, who was an IS commander, and is an Israeli intelligence asset. His band of about 300 men, according to the Israeli Occupation Forces, has been armed to “protect food trucks” trickling into Gaza. But sources on the ground say the group is doing the opposite in commandeering the trucks and looting the vital food supplies for the malnourished, starving Palestinians.
 
 

It is this one-sided ethnic-cleansing, being facilitated by the US and its envoy Steve Witkoff — who has been accused more than once of being economical with the truth after agreeing one thing with Hamas and then reneging on his promise and blaming the armed militant group — that may be impacting public opinion in Europe at least.
The public opinion is shifting, which is also reflected in the robust questioning of the Israeli Hasbara spin doctors in the media. These advocates for the Israeli cause are outraged even by some basic questions a few journalists are beginning to ask because they have had a free pass to spin their lies since October 2023.
The European government leaders are beginning to express unease, only in words and not deeds, in calling the Gaza situation intolerable and unacceptable but stopping well short of any concrete measures such as an arms embargo.
This rhetoric too is driven by the changing public mood reflected in a recent YouGov poll across Europe. The poll showed Israel as being viewed most unfavourably since they started polling on this issue in 2016. And Israel’s actions in Gaza are seen as disproportionate and unjustified.
Even then, President Trump is likely to be convinced his Gaza Riviera plan is on course and in the end the Palestinians will be displaced. With few friends in the Arab world, whose leaders generously opened up their cheque books for the US president and applied little, if any, pressure to secure an end to the genocide, the Palestinians seem to be on their own.
The (resource-starved) government of the ummah’s most potent military power may have co-sponsored the vetoed UN resolution, but its powerful elite queued up at the embassy gate for hours to be able to have the honour of celebrating US Independence Day inexplicably on June 4, a month earlier than July 4.
The ethnic cleansing in Gaza and, don’t forget, the West Bank will continue. The collective conscience of the people around the globe will not be able to stop it on its own. This is the world we inhabit.

The details of the TikToker’s life and death have been broadcast all over the world. Her alleged attacker has been arrested.
Pakistani social and news media has been discussing the case at length. Yousaf was killed a few days after her 17th birthday. Obsessed with her, the suspected murderer, Umar Hayat, a wannabe social media influencer, had harassed Yousaf for some time. When she rebuffed him on the occasion of her birthday, he became angry and, ultimately, homicidal.
 
 

Everyone has seen the CCTV footage of the gun-toting Hayat walking down the street in front of Yousaf’s house. Forcing his way inside the Yousaf home, he managed to get to Sana Yousaf. He shot her twice. She began bleeding uncontrollably. By the time she was taken to hospital, it was too late.
Hayat, in the meantime, fled to Faisalabad, where he was nabbed. He is said to have confessed to his crime.
Stalking is the ultimate act of entitlement. It expresses in the bluntest and most flagrant way the idea that a person is entitled to the attention and body of the person who is being stalked. In this case, that person was a female child. As is the way of the patriarchal morality police in Pakistan, no sooner had the murder occurred and the news released on social media, self-styled commentators, full of bluster and blather whenever it comes to women in the public eye, began with their usual censure. Unable to come to terms with women active on social media and creating content, they blamed the victim, shrugging away the heinous crime that had been committed.

Misogyny is a national sport in Pakistan.

This second tragedy —that of Pakistani men blaming the dead victim even before her body is cold, compounds the original one. Misogyny is a national sport in Pakistan. Whenever women make any sort of collective effort to draw attention to the severe discrimination and lack of physical security they face in society, they are denounced. ‘Feminism’ is touted as a bad word, even though its essential effort is to highlight the fact that women are treated unequally in this society.
Nearly every Pakistani woman alive has experienced harassment from men, whether it is the stares on the street, unnecessary strictures at home, or constant curiosity about her at work. Women in Pakistan have to perfect scowls they can paste on their faces every time they leave their home because the mistake of smiling can persuade some man that he can pursue and harass and stalk them. The inboxes of young women in the country are full of unwanted attention and requests from men. In Sana Yousaf’s case, a man who could not handle rejection decided that the child who had rebuffed him had to be eliminated.
 
 

This tragedy, and so many others like it, even if occurring in less public ways, makes it impossible not to wonder at the lethality of the male ego. Women face rejection just like men do, but they never ever seem to decide that whoever rejected or rebuffed them must have their lives destroyed or taken away. In contrast, instances of men who have been rejected and then turned to violence are a dime a dozen.
Despite this, the men that have chosen to point fingers at Sana Yousaf, or other female TikTokers or feminists in general, never once pause to consider this important and crucial difference. Such is the toxicity of a culture that is apologetic for men even when they deliberately take the lives of women.
Female commentators and content creators in Pakistan should take this moment to highlight insta­nces of the toxic male behaviour they enco­u­nter. When everyone, from students, teachers, housewives, office workers, doctors and lawyers, posts about their harassment at the hands of men who feel they are entitled to have their attention, their bodies and their lives, then Sana Yousaf’s death can be seen as one incident in an all-encompassing women-hating ethos.
The accused in Yousaf’s murder will face justice, but many others like him, who also kill, get away. Tacit agreements among men lead them to shelter other men even when they know that many of them are abusers, harassers, stalkers and woman haters. It is so culturally acceptable to hate women in Pakistan that it can be done openly without any fear of censure or admonishment. Incidents like Yousaf’s death expose this ugly truth and the terrible cost that they can impose on innocent women.
In her TikToks, Sana Yousaf is wholesome and fresh-faced, excited about hanging out with her friends or celebrating her birthday. That life is no more, and once again millions of girls like her have been told that being a girl and being happy can get them killed in Pakistan.

However, some national and international non-governmental organisations marked the day in various areas, though with limited public attention.
Environmentalists expressed reservations over the lack of importance given to the day in this ecologically sensitive region, and called for urgent action to reduce disaster risks stemming from environmental degradation and climate change impacts.
An event related to the day was held at Rakaposhi Viewpoint in the Ghulmet area of Nagar district. It was organised by the Mountain Area Development Network (MADN) in collaboration with WWF-Pakistan.
The event was attended by students, community members, representatives from various local support organisations and officials from NGOs. Activities included a cleanliness drive at Rakaposhi Viewpoint, an awareness walk to highlight the importance of the day, and an exhibition of eco-friendly products showcasing sustainable alternatives to plastic.
Eco-friendly bags were distributed among shopkeepers in the local market to encourage a shift away from plastic bags and promote sustainable habits within the community.
Speakers at the event highlighted the significance of the day. Safdar Hussain, a representative from WWF, said that while such local efforts are essential, it is more important to reflect on the broader environmental challenges, particularly in GB, one of Pakistan’s most ecologically fragile regions.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Red Crescent Society (GB branch) organised a cleanliness drive in Gilgit’s Raja Bazaar area. A rally was taken out from the Gilgit Municipal Office, passing through different parts of the city and concluding at the Gilgit Press Club.

The latter could include those battling poverty and hardship, as well as those fighting for survival against oppressive regimes.
While we celebrate, our thoughts are with the battered people of Palestine, particularly Gaza, who are enduring another Eid in the shadow of genocide.
On Friday, when the people of the occupied territories were celebrating the festival of sacrifice, there were yet more funerals thanks to Israeli belligerence. On Thursday, in the plains of Arafat, at the climax of Haj, the senior Saudi cleric delivering the sermon asked the Muslim world to remember Palestine in their prayers. But while calling for divine deliverance for the Palestinians is a religious duty, most of the Muslim world has done little of substance to stop the butchery in Gaza.
 
 

Meanwhile, Israel continues its aggression against Lebanon, striking Beirut on Thursday and making a mockery of the ceasefire. In the recent past, the Zionist state has also struck Yemen and Syria. These flagrant violations of international law and norms are met by the world community with tut-tutting, and not much else.
Here in Pakistan, we are lucky to have averted a war imposed by our eastern neighbour just a month ago. Yet our internal challenges remain considerable.
While the economy’s ‘big picture’ may be looking better, millions continue to struggle against poverty. The spectre of terrorism also continues to stalk the land, with the people of KP and Balochistan facing the worst of the militancy. The people continue to suffer various shades of violence and denial of their basic rights. The spirit of sacrifice demands that we forego narrow and factional interests, and try and create a more egalitarian society that protects the rights of all.
Where the bloodied people of Gaza are concerned, the Muslim world, as well as conscientious allies of Palestine globally, must cut ties with Israel until it stops its butchery. Words will do little to end the mass starvation and genocide in Gaza; a complete arms and trade blockade of Israel is required if the bloodshed is to stop. Tel Aviv must also be warned against violating the rights and territorial integrity of other regional states.
The spirit of unity within the Islamic world demands that Israel be confronted for its monstrous behaviour. At home, the state needs to treat its people with dignity and compassion. At occasions such as these, we are reminded of lofty goals such as unity, brotherhood and sacrifice, as well as the need to build a society which treats all its members, regardless of caste and creed, with respect and basic decency.

According to the details obtained from the IHC, three division benches decided these tax-related matters. A few of the restraining orders issued in these cases incapacitated Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to collect taxes for over two decades.
The division bench of Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas decided an overwhelming majority of 173 of tax cases involving Rs424bn. Another bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan cleared 94 cases in which over Rs150bn recoveries were stalled.
 
 

A bench comprising acting IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas lifted the stay orders and decided three petitions that had in 2023 restrained the FBR to collect Rs36bn.

Judicial policy body had advised high courts to constitute special benches for disposal of tax-related cases

A two-member division bench comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas decided 125 cases related to Income Tax References, Sales Tax References and Foreign Exchange Regulations Act.
The government’s recoverable Rs290.51bn were stuck in 125 cases related to ITR. 36 STR cases involves recovery of Rs131.55bn while Rs3.16bn were recoverable in 12 cases related to FERA.
In February, CJP Yahya Afridi met with PM Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the agenda of the upcoming meeting of the National Judicial Policy Making Committee. During the meeting, the premier requ­ested the chief justice for expeditious disposal of tax-related cases.
The IMF Governance and Diagnostic Assessment teams visited Pakistan to examine the governance structure of several ministries related to fiscal policy, tax policy, corruption, procurement, audits, and anti-money laundering.
The NJPMC also advised for swift disposal of the tax-related matters, in its meeting held in April, asking the high courts to cons­titute special benches for expe­ditious disposal of tax-related cases. These 270 tax-related cases were pending in the IHC for several years. Following NJPMC’s advice and directions issued by the apex court in the tax matters, the IHC Judicial Registrar put up a note before the acting CJ for consolidation of all the matters, according to documents seen by Dawn.

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
“I am announcing to the citizens of the country that the election will be held on any day in the first half of April 2026,” said Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who leads the caretaker government.
Political parties jostling for power have been repeatedly demanding that Yunus fix an election timetable, while he has said time is needed as the country requires an overhaul of its democratic institutions after Hasina’s tenure.

Interim leader Yunus says his govt’s major responsibility is to ensure ‘transparent, participatory election’

“The government has been doing everything necessary to create an environment conducive to holding the election,” he said in the television broadcast, while repeating his warning that reforms were needed.
 
 

“It should be remembered that Bangladesh has plunged into deep crisis every time it has held a flawed election,” he said, in a speech given on the eve of the Eidul Azha holiday.
“A political party usurped power through such elections in the past, and became a barbaric fascist force.” Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, and her government was accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections.
The interim government had already repeatedly vowed to hold elections before June 2026, but said the more time it had to enact reforms, the better.
Reform of utmost importance
The key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the election frontrunner, has in recent weeks been pushing hard for polls to be held by December.
Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, in a speech to officers in May, also said that elections should be held by December, according to both Bangladeshi media and military sources.
Days after that speech, the government warned that political power struggles risked jeopardising gains that have been made.
“Those who organise such elections are later viewed as culprits, and those who assume office through them become targets of public hatred,” Yunus said on Friday.
“One of the biggest responsibilities of this government is to ensure a transparent… and widely participatory election so that the country does not fall into a new phase of crisis,” he added.
“That is why institutional reform is of utmost importance.” Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 after Hasina’s government launched a crackdown in a bid to cling to power, according to the United Nations.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to her old ally India and she has defied an extradition order to return to Dhaka.
Her trial opened in absentia this month.
Yunus said “reforms, trials, and elections” were the three “core mandates” of his government.
“The sacrifices made by our students and people will be in vain if good governance cannot be established,” he said.
The Election Commission will “present a detailed roadmap” for the vote “at an appropriate time”, the interim leader said without specifying a date.
“We have been in dialogue with all stakeholders to organise free, fair, competitive, and credible election in the history of Bangladesh,” Yunus added.

Israeli and Palestinian media have reported that the group Israel has been working with is part of a local Bedouin tribe led by Yasser Abu Shabab.
The European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) think tank describes Abu Shabab as the leader of a “criminal gang operating in the Rafah area that is widely accused of looting aid trucks”.
Knesset member and former defence minister Avigdor Liberman had told the Kan public broadcaster that the government, at Netanyahu’s direction, was “giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons”.

Popular Forces outfit denies being ‘a tool of the occupation’

“What did Liberman leak? That security sources activated a clan in Gaza that opposes Hamas? What is bad about that?” Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media on Thursday.
 


Michael Milshtein, an expert on Palestinian affairs at the Moshe Dayan Centre in Tel Aviv, told AFP that the Abu Shabab clan was part of a Bedouin tribe that spans across the border between Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula.
Some of the tribe’s members, he said, were involved in “all kinds of criminal activities, drug smuggling, and things like that”.
‘Gangster’
Milshtein said that Abu Shabab had spent time in prison in Gaza and that his clan chiefs had recently denounced him as an Israeli “collaborator and a gangster”.
“It seems that actually the Shabak (Israeli security agency) or the (military) thought it was a wonderful idea to turn this militia, gang actually, into a proxy, to give them weapons and money and shelter” from army operations, Milshtein said.
He claimed that Hamas killed four members of the gang days ago.
The ECFR said Abu Shabab was “reported to have been previously jailed by Hamas for drug smuggling. His brother is said to have been killed by Hamas during a crackdown against the group’s attacks on UN aid convoys”.
Hamas said the group had “chosen betrayal and theft as their path” and called on civilians to oppose them.
Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades, said it had evidence of “clear coordination between these looting gangs, collaborators with the occupation (Israel), and the enemy army itself in the looting of aid and the fabrication of humanitarian crises that deepen the suffering of” Palestinians.
The Popular Forces, as Abu Shabab’s group calls itself, said on Facebook it had “never been, and will never be, a tool of the occupation”. “Our weapons are simple, outdated, and came through the support of our own people.”
Milshtein called Israel’s decision to arm the group “a fantasy, not something that you can really describe as a strategy”.

The minister held discussions with Senator Cynthia Lummis, a key architect of US crypto legislation, as well as senators Bill Hagerty, Rick Scott, Tim Sheehy and Jim Justice in Washington, DC.
Mr Saqib also engaged with members of the House Financial Services Committee and White House advisers, according to a press release issued on Friday.
He said Pakistan is “here to lead” the world of crypto and blockchain.
“From Capitol Hill to the White House, I shared a new face of Pakistan: one driven by youth, innovation, and global partnerships.”
 
 

Mr Saqib’s discussions with US officials focused on Pakistan’s recent initiatives, including plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve, a virtual asset regulatory framework and stablecoin adoption to streamline remittances.
With $36 billion in annual remittances and a booming freelance sector, Pakistan aimed to become a hub for responsible digital finance, the press release stated.
Meeting with NYC mayor
In a separate meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Mr Saqib discussed challenges and approaches to growing the digital asset economy in diverse, high-potential markets, according to an official press release.
During the meeting, which took place at Mayor Adam’s official residence, the two leaders explored opportunities to develop knowledge-sharing initiatives and capacity-building programmes to foster innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance.
 
 

This meeting could pave the way to establish direct collaboration between the New York Crypto Council and the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) — two government-backed bodies committed to exploring potential use cases of Web3 for public service, the press release added.
Mr Saqib is the chief executive officer of PCC.
In the past few months, Pakistan has taken multiple initiatives to regulate and accelerate virtual assets.
The government has already set up PCC and Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the Fatf-comp­liant and responsible adoption of digital assets.
A meeting of PCC held earlier this month discussed the draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan.
The meeting, chaired by the finance minister, also discussed the establishment of formed a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP; SECP; Law and IT & Telecom divisions to review draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure for digital assets.

The Indian premier arrived in the occupied valley today to open a strategic railway line.
According to Indian news media outlets, Modi, during his visit, said that Pakistan attacked ’insaniyat’ and Kashmiriyat’ (humanity and the Kashmiri identity) in Pahalgam.
The Indian premier alleged that Pakistan was “also the enemy of poor’s bread and butter”.
He warned that anyone trying to derail the development in Indian-held Kashmir would have to “face Narendra Modi first”.
Responding to the Indian premier’s remarks, the foreign office today said: “Pakistan firmly rejects the baseless and misleading remarks made by the prime minister of India regarding the situation in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
It added that such statements represented a “deliberate attempt to deflect international attention from the grave and persistent human rights violations being committed in a territory under foreign occupation.”
“We are deeply dismayed that the Indian prime minister has once again chosen to accuse Pakistan of involvement in the Pahalgam attack, without presenting a single piece of credible evidence,” FO said in its statement.
“Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally recognised disputed territory, the final status of which is to be determined in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the will of the Kashmiri people,” it said, adding that no amount of rhetoric could change the legal and historical reality.
“Claims of development in IOJK ring hollow against the backdrop of an unprecedented military presence, suppression of fundamental freedoms, arbitrary arrests, and a concerted effort to alter the region’s demography in violation of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention,” FO said.
FO called upon the international community, including the UN and human rights organisations, to hold India accountable for its oppression and to ensure that the “Kashmiri people are allowed to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its principled support for the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for their rights and dignity,” FO said.
Modi’s visit follows a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed six Indian jets in response. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-06-07 03:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/070643400589944.png?r=064904' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915934/world-less-safe-after-escalation-in-subcontinent-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>World ‘less safe’ after escalation in Subcontinent, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>• Ex-foreign minister says threshold for war in South Asia ‘lowest it’s ever been’; his stark assessment highlights tenuous nature of ceasefire
• Calls on US to help bring New Delhi to negotiating table after Trump acknowledges presence of ‘strong leadership’ in Islamabad
WASHINGTON: Warning that the current ceasefire between India and Pakistan was quite tenuous, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that the world is now a less safe place than it was before the crisis in the Subcontinent.
The statement comes a day after US President Donald Trump acknowledged the presence of “very strong leadership” in Islamabad as being one of the contributing factors to a recent de-escalation of tensions with India.
In meetings with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chief, who is currently heading a high-powered Pakistani delegation to the US, said the ceasefire was “a welcome start”, but cautioned that “South Asia, India, and Pakistan, and by extension, the rest of the world, are less safe today than when we started this crisis.”
In contrast with efforts of India’s national security caucus, the Pakistani delegation currently in Washington pursued a focused but quieter diplomatic effort on Capitol Hill this week.
The delegation’s meetings with senior US lawmakers — members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and key senators — underscored Pakistan’s effort to sustain a credible narrative amid a tilt towards New Delhi in US policy circles.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari held candid and constructive meetings with US Congressman Brian Mast, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Congressman Gregory Meeks, Ranking Member; Congressman Bill Huizenga, Chair of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia; and senior lawmaker Brad Sherman.
 
 

Central to the delegation’s message was the unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India, described by Mr Bhutto-Zardari as “a dangerous precedent and a violation of international law.”
The potential weaponisation of water resources adds a new and alarming dimension to the already fragile peace framework between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, he said.
“The threshold for all-out war between India and Pakistan is the lowest it has ever been in our history,” he stated, adding: “As it stands today, if there’s a terrorist attack anywhere in India, proof or no proof, it means war”.
This reality underscores the urgency for sustained diplomatic engagement to prevent miscalculations that could lead to full-scale conflict.
He urged the United States to leverage its influence, stating, “The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
 






This aligns with President Trump’s messaging as well. Speaking to reporters after an interaction with German leader Freidrich Merz in the Oval Office a day earlier, Trump had categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink by threatening to pull out of trade talks, which he claimed both countries were currently engaged in with the US.
“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said, referring to the recent escalation in the Subcontinent.
Pakistan House reception
The Pakistani delegation also engaged with a bipartisan group of US legislators at a dinner reception hosted by Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at Pakistan House.
The event saw the attendance of members of Congress, including Representatives Jack Bergman, Tom Suozzi, Ryan Zinke, Maxine Waters, Al Green, Jonathan Jackson, Hank Johnson, Stacey Plaskett, Henry Cuellar, Mike Turner, Riley Moore, George Latimer, and Cleo Fields, among others.
 






Addressing them, Mr Bhutto Zardari presented a compelling case for regional peace and stability, characterizing the delegation’s visit as a “mission for peace.”
“Our Prime Minister, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, gave this delegation a mission, and the mission is peace — to engage in dialogue and diplomacy with India to resolve our issues,” stated Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
Appreciating the crucial role played by the United States in facilitating a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations, the former foreign minister urged US legislators to continue their efforts in maintaining peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

“We’re here to appeal to you, requesting the United States to aid us in this pursuit for peace. The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the Chairman noted.
“Just as urgently as we needed the United States government’s help to achieve the ceasefire, we need your assistance today to help engage India and prevent policies that lead to regional and global insecurity,” he said.
The US Congress members assured their full support for regional peace and stability in South Asia, commending the delegation for their comprehensive briefing on the ongoing crisis.

The prime minister, acco­mpanied by his delegation, including the army chief, deputy PM and federal ministers, also performed Umrah on Friday when pilgrims performed the last major ritual of Haj — the “stoning of the devil”.
The PM, who is on a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, met the Saudi crown prince in Makkah, according to an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
 






“The prime minister expressed appreciation for the kingdom’s proactive role during recent tensions between Pakistan and India, and its steadfast commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region and beyond.”

PM Shehbaz also underscored Pakistan’s policy of responsible restraint in the face of Indian aggression, emphasising that “sustainable peace in South Asia is achievable only through dialogue”.
 
 

The meeting reaffirmed the deep-rooted, strategic, and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The PM was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
The PM also extended Eidul Azha greetings to King Salman bin Abdulaziz and the crown prince on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan.
He commended the kingdom’s hospitality and service to the pilgrims from around the world who are in Saudi Arabia to perform Haj.
Situation in Gaza
The two leaders also discussed the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.
They urged the international community to fulfil its moral and legal obligations to help the people of Palestine.
They reiterated support for a just and durable resolution to the Palestinian issue in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Prime Minister Shehbaz expressed satisfaction with the bilateral political, economic and security cooperation.
 
 

The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The prime minister invited the crown prince to visit Pakistan, which he accepted.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz, accompanied by the army chief and his delegation, performed Umrah.
 






The delegation offered prayers inside the Holy Kaaba, said the press release.
Nawaz offers Eid prayers
Meanwhile, former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif offered Eid prayer at the Regents Park mosque in London.
According to media reports, he prayed for the country’s development and prosperity.
He also urged the United Nations to play its role in resolving the Kashmir issue.
Last Haj rite
More than 1.6 million pilgrims performing Haj ‘stoned the devil’ on Friday, as Muslims around the globe celebrated Eidul Azha.
Starting at dawn, the pilgrims threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolising the devil in the Mina valley, on the outskirts of Makkah.
This year’s Haj saw noticeably thinner crowds as authorities implemented a wide-ranging crackdown on illicit pilgrims with a heavy security presence at holy sites in Makkah and surrounding areas.
The measures, including heat mitigation efforts, were aimed at preventing a repeat of last year’s Haj that saw 1,301 people die in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius.

The plan proposes gradually lowering import duties, liberalising used car imports and permitting commercial imports of used vehicles. Industry stakeholders warn these measures could destabilise the local auto sector, erode foreign exchange reserves and widen the current account deficit.
 
 

Under the proposed tariff rationalisation, duties on completely built-up (CBU) vehicles would be slashed to 15 per cent over five years, down from the current 20pc. Additional Customs Duty (ACD) and Regulatory Duty (RD) will be phased out, and the number of tariff slabs reduced from five to four. The government also plans to eliminate the fifth schedule and lower the maximum slab rate to 15pc.
This sweeping overhaul of the trade regime is apparently aimed at fostering export-led growth, but the auto sector sees it as a serious threat. While the IMF-backed policy seeks to bring Pakistan’s tariff structures in line with global norms, local manufacturers argue that it risks flooding the market with cheaper used vehicles and reversing years of progress in localisation, employment and investment.

Local carmakers say IMF-backed policy risks flooding market with cheaper used vehicles; fear it will reverse ‘years of progress in localisation, jobs and investment’

IMC urges policy stability
Indus Motor Company (IMC) CEO Ali Asghar Jamali urged the government to avoid abrupt tariff changes and inconsistent policies that, he said, threaten the viability of Pakistan’s auto industry, which he said is the 34th largest in the world.
This sector contributes four per cent of total tax revenue, is among the top contributors in customs and sales tax collection and sustains 2.5 million jobs, Mr Jamali said. “With over $5 billion invested, harming this strategic industry risks revenue loss, unemployment and stalled localisation. Long-term, stable policies are essential for sustainable growth,” he said.
He suggested that industry volumes be stabilised at 350,000 units annually to strengthen local supply chains. He also called for maintaining a balanced duty differential of up to 40pc between completely built units (CBUs) and completely knocked down (CKD) units, and up to 25pc between raw materials and auto parts.
He also proposed increasing financing limits to 70pc of the vehicle’s price with a seven-year term and gradually phasing out used car imports by incentivising local production and rationalising the tax structure for fair competition.
‘Parts makers being undermined’
Aamir Allawala, CEO of Tecno Auto Glass Limited and former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Auto Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), argued that auto parts makers “need consistent volume and respect from the government as the biggest employment generator in the country”.
He criticised the growing market share of used vehicles, which now stands at 25pc, saying it comes at the cost of the indigenous vendor base.
Mr Allawala alleged that used car imports are widely known to involve black money, where transactions are often made through hawala and sales conducted in cash without any traceable money trail.
Still, the government continues to encourage it by allowing “ridiculously low fixed duties” on used vehicles below 1,300cc while planning to increase sales tax on small local vehicles from 12.5pc to 18pc, he lamented.
He said the industry needed the continuation of a policy that encourages local manufacturing and helps increase volumes to 500,000 vehicles per year.
Steel industry seeks road map
Malik Javed Iqbal, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP), called on the government to establish a consistent, homegrown tariff policy in consultation with stakeholders.
 
 

“Incentivising steel production through iron ore will further boost the domestic steel industry, which has the capacity to meet the entire demand of steel now and in future and can also opt for exports,” he said.
He said the revival of the steel and construction industries by the government can be boosted through a substantial increase in allocations in the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) and a further cut in the power tariff to make prices of steel products affordable.
“Tariff reduction without ensuring regionally competitive costs of critical inputs like power, gas, interest rates and taxes would invite massive dumping of steel from other countries, further hitting the local industry,” he added.
Used car importers
On the other hand, All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA) President H.M. Shehzad expressed optimism that the upcoming budget would include provisions to increase the age limit for used car imports to five years and reduce import duties. He said the government is also likely to permit the commercial import of used vehicles.
He hoped these measures could reduce used car prices by Rs500,000 to Rs1 million and ensure the availability of these vehicles under Rs2 million.
Mr Shehzad pointed out that a five-year-old car in Japan costs $3,000-$4,000 compared to $8,000 for a three-year-old vehicle, while a locally assembled 660cc car is priced above Rs3 million. A duty cut and age limit hike could push annual used car imports from 30,000 to 70,000-80,000 units, bringing in additional revenue, he added.

Tokyo-based ispace had hoped to join US firms Intuitive Machines and Firefly Aerospace in making successful commercial moon landings amid a global race that includes state-run lunar missions from China and India.
Although the failure means another multi-year pause in Japan’s commercial access to the moon, the country remains committed to the US-led Artemis programme and a wide range of Japanese companies are studying lunar exploration as a business frontier.
Resilience, ispace’s second lunar lander, had problems measuring its distance to the surface and could not slow its descent fast enough, the company said, adding it has not been able to communicate with Resilience after a likely hard landing.
“Truly diverse scenarios were possible, including issues with the propulsion system, software or hardware, especially with sensors,” ispace Chief Technology Officer Ryo Ujiie told a press conference.
A room of more than 500 ispace employees, shareholders, sponsors and government officials abruptly grew silent when flight data was lost less than two minutes before the scheduled touchdown time during a public viewing event at mission partner Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp in the wee hours in Tokyo.
Shares of ispace were untraded, overwhelmed by sell orders, and looked set to close at the daily limit-low, which would mark a 29 per cent fall. At the close on Thursday, ispace had a market capitalisation of more than 110 billion yen ($766 million).

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the general area Kolpur of Balochistan’s Kachhi district on reported presence of terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.”
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the Fitna al Hindustan terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, two Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” ISPR said.
The statement said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous Indian sponsored terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrrorist found in the area,” ISPR said, adding that the security forces were determined to wipeout the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice.
The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan.
Last week, a district official was killed when his house was attacked by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab city, a statement from the provincial government had said.
Four soldiers were martyred as security forces killed 12 terrorists linked to “Indian proxy groups” in operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the military’s media wing had said last week.
Earlier this week, seven terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan.
Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.</p><small>2025-06-06 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06184135aba8a9b.jpg?r=184138' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821/sindh-bans-four-seater-rickshaws-outsources-fitness-checks-in-traffic-law-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh bans four-seater rickshaws, outsources fitness checks in traffic law overhaul</strong></a><br><p>In a bid to tighten traffic regulation enforcement, the Sindh government on Friday approved a set of legal changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines, as part of an overhaul aimed at improving road safety and accountability.
The decision comes as Karachi witnesses a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.
According to a statement from the home department, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar chaired the meeting to discuss necessary amendments to the Motor Vehicles Rules in light of the alarming increase in the number of accidents in the province.
Briefed by the secretaries of law and transport, as well as the inspector general of police and deputy inspector general of traffic police, the meeting “approved plans to outsource vehicle fitness certification to third parties and enforce a ban on four-seater rickshaws,” the statement said.
According to the statement, key decisions taken during the meeting included mandatory fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties.
Lanjar stated, “The services of third parties will be engaged for issuing fitness certificates, while formal memoranda of understanding (MoUs) will be signed with them in compliance with all applicable regulations.”
The meeting also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.
Participants unanimously approved legal amendments to enforce a complete ban on four-seater rickshaws, the statement said, adding that Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla assured full support from the excise department in enforcing traffic regulations by ensuring that no registration or route permits will be issued for four-seater or larger rickshaws like Qingqi, as many accidents have taken place due to rickshaws colliding with trucks.
He further said that a crackdown will be launched against any such vehicles found operating on the roads.
While promising a prompt completion of the vehicle fitness service structure, he asserted that strict enforcement of fitness requirements would follow.
 
 

Chawla also made it mandatory for water tankers and dumpers to install trackers and sensors. It was decided that a comprehensive draft of the new regulations would be prepared and submitted to the Sindh government for approval and ratification.
Minister Lanjar added that to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and rule violations, only 1x2 seater rickshaws would be allowed on the roads. Strict fines were also approved, including:

Rs200,000 for wrong-way driving by government vehicles,
Rs25,000 for motorcyclists driving against traffic,
Rs100,000 for four-wheelers violating one-way rules,
Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and PKR 50,000 for car drivers without a driving license,
Rs100,000 for first-time offences of one-wheeling or drifting, increasing to PKR 200,000 and PKR 300,000 for repeat offences.

Additionally, Lanjar approved the mandatory installation of at least five cameras in heavy/load-carrying vehicles.
It was decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines will not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
He further said that the traffic, transport, and excise systems would be interlinked and moved online, and announced the appointment of a dedicated traffic magistrate to handle traffic law offence cases, per the statement.</p><small>2025-06-06 16:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06211001dee17af.jpg?r=211035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915813/pakistan-condemns-israeli-airstrikes-in-lebanon-urges-intl-community-to-hold-tel-aviv-accountable' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan condemns Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, urges int’l community to hold Tel Aviv accountable</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday “unequivocally” condemned the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut and southern parts of Lebanon, urging the international community to hold Tel Aviv accountable and take immediate action against the offensive.
According to Al Jazeera, the attack on Thursday targeting Hezbollah marks the fourth time Israel has bombed Beirut after a ceasefire was signed in November 2024. The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, in a statement after the strikes, voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression,” calling the attack — carried out on the eve of Eidul Azha — a “flagrant violation of an international accord.”
Israel and Hezbollah started trading fire on Oct 8, a day after Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza offensive. Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The Foreign Office, in a statement, extending solidarity to Lebanese people during “this difficult time” and highlighted that “the reckless use of force threatens civilian lives, fuels regional instability, and undermines efforts for lasting peace.”
The FO noted that the attack constituted a violation of the sovereignty of Lebanon as well as the ceasefire signed between Israel and Hezbollah.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations and ceasefire mediators, to take immediate action to hold Israeli occupying forces accountable and prevent further escalation,” the statement read.
“Pakistan remains firmly committed to peace, justice, and the principles of international law.”
On Thursday, the prime minister of Lebanon, Nawaf Salam, announced that the Lebanese army had dismantled “more than 500 military positions and arms depots” belonging to Hezbollah in the south of the country.
“There can be no security or stability while Israel’s daily violations persist, parts of our land remain occupied, and our prisoners are not freed,” Salam added.</p><small>2025-06-06 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06095726329ce72.png?r=095948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756/trump-not-interested-in-talking-to-musk-as-they-feud-over-tax-cut-bill-official' target='_blank'><strong>Trump ‘not interested in talking to Musk’ as they feud over tax-cut bill: official</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is not interested in talking with his former ally Elon Musk, amid a bitter feud over the president’s sweeping tax-cut bill, a White House official said on Friday, adding that no phone call between the two men was planned for the day.
A separate White House official had said earlier that Trump and Musk were going to talk to each other on Friday.
Earlier, Donald Trump threatened to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk’s companies and the world’s richest man suggested the US president should be impeached, marking a stark end to an unlikely alliance and leaving onlookers wondering what was next.
The hostilities between the former allies intensified when the president criticised Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then lobbed verbal barbs at each other on their social media platforms: Trump’s Truth Social and Musk’s X.
“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted.
In pre-market trading on Friday, shares in Musk’s Tesla rose as much as five per cent after the early news that the two men were scheduled to speak.
Tesla had closed down 14pc on Thursday, losing about $150 billion in market value in the largest single-day decline in value in the electric vehicle maker’s history.
The market capitalisation of Tesla Inc has fallen 29.3pc to $917bn so far this year, the biggest drop among big companies in the world.
Minutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, “Yes,” to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached, an unthinkable move in Congress where Trump’s Republicans hold majorities in both chambers.
 






The trouble between the two started brewing days ago, when Musk denounced Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill.
The president initially held his tongue while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.
Trump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk.
“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.
As Trump spoke, Musk responded in real time on X.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” wrote Musk, who spent nearly $300 million backing Trump and other Republicans in last year’s election.
In another post, Musk asserted that Trump’s signature tariffs would push the US into a recession later this year.
 






Musk’s businesses also include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.
Musk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government’s space program, said that as a result of Trump’s threats he would begin decommissioning SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Late on Thursday, Musk backed off the threat.
And in a sign of a possible detente to come, Musk subsequently wrote: “You’re not wrong,” in response to billionaire investor Bill Ackman saying Trump and Musk should make peace.
 






Feud puts $22bn SpaceX contracts at risk, jolting US space programme
About $22 billion of SpaceX’s government contracts are at risk and multiple US space programmes could face dramatic changes in the fallout from Musk and Trump’s explosive feud.
Taking Trump’s threat to terminate Musk’s government contracts seriously, Musk said he would begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by Nasa.
Hours later, however, Musk appeared to reverse course.
Responding to a follower on X urging him and Trump to “cool off and take a step back for a couple of days,” Musk wrote: “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”
Still, Musk’s mere threat to abruptly pull its Dragon spacecraft out of service marked an unprecedented outburst from one of Nasa’s leading commercial partners.
Nasa press secretary Bethany Stevens declined to comment on SpaceX, but said: “We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president’s objectives in space are met.”
Musk ‘very welcome’ in Europe: official
Separately, a spokesperson for the European Commission said today that Musk is “very welcome” in Europe.
At the commission’s daily briefing, spokesperson Paula Pinho was asked whether Musk had reached out to the European Union with a view to relocating his businesses, or setting up new ones.
“He’s very welcome,” she replied with a smile.
The commission’s spokesperson for tech matters, Thomas Regnier, followed up by stressing — straight-faced — that “everyone is very welcome indeed to start and to scale in the EU”.
“That is precisely the objective of Choose Europe,” he said, referencing an EU initiative in favour of start-ups and expanding businesses.
Punching back
Trump and Musk are both political fighters with a penchant for using social media to attack their perceived enemies, and many observers had predicted a falling out.
Musk had become one of Trump’s most visible advisers as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping and controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.
After leaving that role, Musk this week targeted what Trump has named his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination” that would deepen the federal deficit.
His attacks amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill’s prospects in the Senate.
Nonpartisan analysts say Trump’s bill could add $2.4tr to $5tr to the nation’s $36.2tr in debt.
A prolonged feud between the pair could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections if it leads to a loss of Musk’s campaign spending or erodes support for Trump in Silicon Valley.
“Elon really was a significant portion of the ground game this last cycle,” said a Republican strategist with ties to Musk and the Trump administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
“If he sits out the midterms, that worries me.”
On Tuesday, Musk posted that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”
Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. Musk’s increasing focus on politics provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk’s attention was too divided.</p><small>2025-06-06 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/06181836cc6d7a4.jpg?r=181903' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915824/ukraine-war-existential-kremlin-says-launching-revenge-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine war ‘existential,’ Kremlin says, launching revenge strikes</strong></a><br><p>The Kremlin said on Friday that the Ukraine war was “existential” for Russia, after it launched a wave of retaliatory drone and missile strikes that killed at least three in Kyiv.
AFP journalists heard air raid sirens and explosions ring out over the capital throughout the night as Ukrainian air defence batteries intercepted waves of Russian drones and missiles.
Kyiv announced that Russia had fired 45 missiles and 407 drones in the barrage, after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed retaliation for an audacious Ukrainian attack on several Russian airbases.
President Volodymyr Zelensky in response urged allies to “decisively” ramp up pressure on Russia to halt the war, which has left tens of thousands dead over more than three years of fighting.
“We heard a drone — we heard it coming very close, and then there was an explosion,” Ksenia, a Kyiv resident, told AFP outside a multiple-storey housing block that was left with a charred and gaping hole.
“Our windows and window panes were blown out, but we got away with a slight shock,” she added, standing in a courtyard littered with broken glass and debris.
The Kremlin on Friday cast its three-year invasion as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia.
“For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, responding to US President Donald Trump’s comparison of Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children.
‘Act decisively’
Zelensky said at least three people had been killed in the capital, and that Russia had targeted nine regions of Ukraine, including Lviv and Volyn in the west, which border EU and Nato member Poland.
“If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
Deadly attacks have escalated in recent weeks even as the two sides hold talks aimed at ending the conflict triggered by Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
Cities and villages have been destroyed across eastern Ukraine and millions forced to flee their homes, with Russia’s forces controlling around one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory.
Russian aerial assaults have become larger in recent weeks as concerns build over Ukraine’s strained air defence capacity.
The defence ministry in Moscow said its forces had launched the “massive” missile and drone strike in “response” to recent attacks by Kyiv on its territory.
Putin earlier this week told Trump that Moscow would retaliate over the Ukrainian attack on Sunday in which drones damaged nuclear-capable military planes at Russian air bases, including thousands of kilometres behind the front lines in Siberia.
The brazen operation, 18 months in the planning, saw Kyiv smuggle more than 100 small drones into Russia, park them near Russian air bases and unleash them in a coordinated attack.
Retaliation
Despite several recent rounds of meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, Putin has repeatedly rejected a ceasefire, and has issued a host of sweeping demands on Ukraine if it wants to halt the fighting.
They include completely pulling troops out of four regions claimed by Russia, but which its army does not fully control, an end to western military support, and a ban on Ukraine joining Nato.
The overnight Russian attack left multiple fires burning in various districts of the capital.
Three first responders from the state emergency service were killed while dealing with an earlier strike, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said.
“They were working under fire to help people,” he said, adding nine more were wounded and that “doctors are fighting for their lives.”
Kyiv’s mayor said earlier that four were killed in the capital but later revised down that toll.
Several strikes also hit the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in western Ukraine.
At least 49 people were wounded in total, Zelensky said.
Moscow meanwhile said Ukrainian strikes overnight on Russia wounded three people in the western Tula region, while Kyiv claimed to have staged successful attacks on two air fields deep inside Russian territory.
Footage shared on social media showed a large fire and smoke billowing into the air at an oil facility that serves a military site in Russia’s Saratov region, which has been frequently targeted.
The Russian defence ministry said it downed 174 Ukrainian drones overnight. Ten downed drones were headed for the Russian capital, according to Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.</p><small>2025-06-06 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/061528074268376.jpg?r=152828' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915816/china-seeks-improved-ties-with-canada-amid-rising-trade-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>China seeks improved ties with Canada amid rising trade tensions</strong></a><br><p>China called on Friday for steps to improve bilateral ties with Canada, saying there were no deepseated conflicts of interest, following a spike in trade tensions with many of Beijing’s Western trade partners this year.
China is willing to work with Canada to put ties on a healthy and stable path and find solutions to address each other’s concerns through enhanced dialogue, Premier Li Qiang told Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in a phone call on Friday, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
“There is no fundamental conflict of interests between the two countries,” Li said.
Li’s talks with Carney followed a highly-anticipated phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, which Trump said led to “a very positive conclusion” and offered hope the trade war between the world’s two largest economies might start to de-escalate.
As the effects of trade frictions start to make their way into the already soft Chinese economy, Beijing has stepped up engagement with other countries to alleviate friction despite earlier retaliation.
In March, Beijing announced tariffs on over $2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products in retaliation for Ottawa’s levies on Chinese electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products introduced in October.
Beijing has also launched an anti-dumping investigation into Canadian canola that is set to conclude in September.
Canola, also known as rapeseed, was one of Canada’s top exports to China, the world’s No. 1 agricultural importer, prior to Beijing’s investigation.
“The two governments should listen to and respond to the people’s calls and do more to deepen the friendly cooperation and enhance mutual understanding and trust,” Li told Carney.
 
 

China is Canada’s second-largest trading partner, trailing far behind the United States. Canada exported $47 billion worth of goods to the world’s second-largest economy in 2024, according to Chinese customs data.
Beijing is also willing to work with Canada to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, Li added.
 
 

Beijing’s olive branch to Ottawa also comes ahead of a Group of Seven summit of leaders in Canada in mid-June.
At the G7 summit in Italy last year, G7 leaders were critical of China, saying they would take steps to shield their economies from China’s “ unfair “ practices.</p><small>2025-06-06 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0614301149d6299.jpg?r=143024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915812/ex-federal-minister-abbas-afridi-succumbs-to-burn-injuries-sustained-in-gas-leak-explosion' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-federal minister Abbas Afridi succumbs to burn injuries sustained in gas leak explosion</strong></a><br><p>Former federal minister and Senator Abbas Afridi on Friday succumbed to burn injuries sustained in a gas leak explosion a day earlier, while three others were wounded.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com that their team had rushed Afridi and three others to Kohat Combined Military Hospital, from where Afridi was taken to a burn centre in Kharian, Punjab, in a helicopter.
Nouman Ali, spokesperson for the Kohat police, told Dawn.com, “Afridi was in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. His body was brought to Kohat today.”
He said the three others had been transported to a divisional headquarters hospital.
The police spokesperson said Afridi and his friends, Dilnawaz, Javed Afridi and Nadeem, were in the Hujra when a gas leak caused an explosion. The intensity of the blast damaged the walls of the Hujra.
Afridi’s funeral will be held today at 5pm at Babri Banda, Kohat.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow and grief over Afridi’s death.
He expressed his heartfelt sympathy to the deceased’s father Senator Shamim Afridi, the deceased’s brother, who is provincial information secretary of the People’s Party, Amjad Afridi and other relatives, saying: “We all share the same grief with them in this hour of grief.”
Kundi directed higher authorities to investigate the nature of the explosion after receiving information about the blast, and that a transparent inquiry be conducted.
Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani and Deputy Chairman  Zahid Khan also expressed grief over the demise of Afridi, calling him a “sociable and sincere person.”

It wasn’t marked by dogfights or dramatic barrel rolls seen in past conflicts between the two arch-rival South Asian neighbours. Instead, the skies over Pakistan and India became a silent battlefield of invisible forces — electromagnetic pulses, jamming beams, satellite interference, and beyond-visual-range missiles slicing through the night.’
This excerpt from a Dawn report describes the recent aerial clash between Pakistan and India, which has been termed as a significant development in the regional air power constellation.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and launched a series of airstrikes on different Pakistani cities.
In its response, the Pakistan Air Force took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 within 40 minutes. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat
India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan’s recent admission that his country’s fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan during the escalation has been termed a “veiled criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies” by an expert.
New Delhi’s fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, which included mosques in Bahawalpur, Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Muridke, as well as villages in Sialkot district and Shakargarh.

In an interview with Bloomberg at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Chauhan had said, “I think what is important is not the jets being downed but why the jets were shot down.”
In response to a query by a TV show’s host, he confirmed that Indian fighter jets were shot down during the recent escalation between the two countries, claiming that the four-day conflict never came close to the point of nuclear war.
Speaking to Dawn.com about the Indian general’s comments, Ejaz Haider, Senior Resident Fellow at the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research, said: “The Bloomberg interview by India’s chief of defence staff appears to be an attempt by India’s military to push back against a policy by the Hindutva political leadership to use the Pakistan card for domestic political reasons.”
He added that as a professional military leader, Gen Chauhan was aware of capabilities and shortcomings and realised that India had no overwhelming advantage against Pakistan.
“He also understands that Narendra Modi’s policy is escalatory and dangerous,” the analyst continued.
Haider said it was important to note how the Indian general conveyed his message. “He was asked if a plane was shot down. He could have circumvented the question by saying that combat entails losses, and India achieved its objectives by striking targets inside Pakistan.”
Haider recalled how the question was tackled by India’s Director-General of Air Operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti.
Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal Bharti said, “Losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.
 
 

“Instead, Chauhan spoke of fighter losses in the plural and kept up the plural in the follow-up question, too,” Haider remarked.
The Indian chief of defence staff had also said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.
“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and fly all our jets again, targeting at long range,” India Today quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.
Speaking on the Indian general’s admission that the IAF flew their jets again on May 10, after two days, Haider said, “This is a remarkable confession and could not be inadvertent.
“He went on to say that IAF did not fly for two days, until May 10, when they scrambled outside the PAF’s engagement envelope,” he added.
“This admission is significant because for two days, the Indian defences were without air cover, and that allowed the PAF to send in their fighter jets on the 10th to take out the Indian S-400’s [air defence system] cheeseboard radar,” he explained.
India had bought the Russian air defence system in a $5 billion deal in 2018, despite a looming threat of US sanctions on countries that trade with Russia’s defence and intelligence sectors.

He further explained that even on May 10, when India targeted Pakistani bases, the Indian jets flew outside the range of PAF’s fighter aircraft after the “silent kills” they had faced at the hands of the PAF on the night of May 6-7.
“He (Chauhan) is already been accused of going beyond his remit by Hindutva-affiliated journalists, who have called for disciplinary action against him,” he continued.
Haider added that it would be interesting to see how the Indian military’s professionalism plays out against BJP’s Hindutva politics.
Western military experts had also kept a close eye on the outcome of this aerial confrontation with a particular focus on how Chinese weaponry was battle-tested by the Pakistani armed forces, coming out on top against the French-made Rafale, which is at the cutting edge of Nato’s weapon arsenal.
Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute told the British newspaper The Guardian that “Any state producing or buying weapons is keen to see how the product does in real conflict. Tests and exercises can tell most about capabilities of weapons, but the ultimate test is often combat.”
Similarly, Andrew Small, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, was quoted as saying that the Pakistan-India aerial combat provided the weapon’s suppliers a chance to assess the performance of their weaponry. In Pakistan’s case, the supplier was China and in India’s case, mostly Europe and Russia.
“It gives them a chance to assess their performance under far more complex and challenging conditions than usual, and with Pakistan, this is not just about the fighter jets themselves, it’s about the missiles, the radar systems, and the whole technology spine of the Pakistani military, from electronic warfare capabilities to satellite systems,” Small said.

Former foreign minister and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, speaking about the clash, told reporters on Tuesday that Pakistan could have potentially shot down more Indian jets but exercised restraint during the response to the attack by New Delhi.
Bilawal, who is currently leading a Pakistani diplomatic delegation to the United States, said, “Even the shooting down of those six planes was Pakistan showing restraint, 20 Indian jets were locked by our planes,” adding that only those planes were targeted which had released their payload on civilian targets in Pakistan.
Following the air battle on the night of May 6-7, Islamabad then intercepted drones sent by India on May 8 and following tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.
Plethora of evidence
Even before the Indian top general’s confirmation, there was a plethora of evidence to establish the veracity of Pakistan’s claims, which were confirmed by different sources.
American and French officials had also earlier confirmed that Pakistan shot down an Indian jet using fighter aircraft it acquired from China, CNN and Reuters reported earlier in the month.
CNN cited a senior US official saying, as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India’s air strikes inside Pakistan.
A high-ranking French intelligence official also told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.

Earlier in the month, the American newspaper The Washington Post also verified visual evidence that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
The paper based its findings on analyses by former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball, Etienne Marcuz, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research and an anonymous French air power expert.
“In a review of more than a dozen images and videos posted online in the aftermath of the strikes, The Post verified debris consistent with at least two French-made fighter jets flown by the Indian Air Force — a Rafale and a Mirage 2000,” The Post reported.
Separately, Al Jazeera reported on the morning of May 7, after the clash, that three fighter jets had crashed in Indian Occupied Kashmir.
