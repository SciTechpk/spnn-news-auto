Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar a day the Pakistani government announced it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.
The development followed protracted negotiations between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, consultations among national leaders and intercessions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and UAE.
The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was announced by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar today, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.
In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.
“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”

The development came a day after a request for an ‘urgent’ meeting — submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa — was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for Tuesday (today).
The two-member bench resumed the hearing today, during which CJP Afridi appointed Safdar as “friend of the court”, with the court directing him to visit Adiala jail today and submit a written report regarding Imran’s living conditions by tomorrow.
PTI counsel Latif Khosa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, CJP Afridi barred Khosa from speaking, while AGP Awan said that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of August 24, 2023”.
In 2023, SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Imran’s “living conditions in jail”.
He informed the court that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order.
“We had submitted a written report to the chamber on August 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report from August 5 to August 18 was also included.
In response to this, CJP Afridi said, “After the August 24, 2023 order, there has not been any order on record which was satisfactory to the SC”.
In the court order, available with Dawn, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the former premier was imprisoned in the District jail, Attock, in 2023.
Hence, it maintained that the court “considered appropriate that a report regarding the present ‘living conditions of the petitioner in jail’ be submitted by the Superintendent, Central Prison, Rawalpindi.”
Subsequently, the court appointed Safdar as amicus curiae.
“Salman Safdar should go to Adiala as a friend of the court,” CJP Afridi said.
“We have full faith in Salman Safdar,” he further remarked.
“He should be given full access to the PTI founder so he may be able to file a written response,” he added.
Justice Afridi directed that Safdar should “not be kept waiting outside Adiala”, assuring him that in case he encounters any issues, the CJP’s personal staff will be available.
Safdar, addressing the court, asked “if the scope of the report was limited to living conditions only”, citing concerns regarding Imran’s health in light of a recent medical procedure.
“Submit a report of the living conditions only,” CJP Afridi responded.
AGP Awan also requested the court to “include in the order that a report had already been submitted”.
Towards the end of the hearing, Khosa took the rostrum again, seeking that his request to meet Imran be accepted as well. However, the request was again rejected.
The court then adjourned the hearing till February 12.
Raja terms conversation with court as ‘beneficial’
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja recalled his meeting with the chief justice last Friday, adding that Imran’s incarceration and health came under discussion.
He termed the conversation with the court as “beneficial” and that progress had been made as a result of it.
However, the PTI leader clarified, “We are not declaring anything as final. We are not saying everything is good [and] we have gotten everything. This is not the case.”
Raja said the lawyers will head to the Adiala jail today to meet Imran.
“We will see what demeanour is adopted towards us,” he said.
The PTI leader called for the “system to […] return to humanity”. “It is humanity and piousness that we are demanding right now,” he stated.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
According to a two-page memorandum filed by PTI last week to the SC registrar, the party had requested immediate jail visitation rights for Imran with his family, doctors, lawyers and friends.
In the memorandum, it was alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101508165308b6b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972268/workers-remittances-total-35bn-in-january-up-113pc-in-jul-jan-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Workers’ remittances total $3.5bn in January, up 11.3pc in Jul–Jan FY26</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday said overseas workers’ remittances were recorded at $3.5bn in January, increasing by 11.3 per cent during Jul-Jan of the current fiscal year (FY26).
“Cumulatively, with an inflow of US$23.2 billion, workers’ remittances increased by 11.3 per cent during Jul-Jan FY26 compared to US$20.9 billion received during the same period last year,” said SBP.
“In terms of growth, remittances increased by 15.4pc on a year-to-year basis,” the central bank said.
It elaborated that the remittances in January were “mainly sourced” from Saudi Arabia ($739.6 million), the United Arab Emirates ($694.2m), the United Kingdom ($572.1m) and the United States of America ($294.7m).







Remittances in December rose to the highest level of FY26, reaching $3.6bn, largely driven by continued incentives for sending money through formal channels and relative stability in the exchange rate.
Currency experts believe remittance growth this year is weaker than in FY25. They cite concerns over a “managed” exchange rate, suggesting some inflows may be diverted away from official banking channels.
Pakistan is among the top countries receiving large foreign exchange inflows through remittances. While a growing number of jobseekers leaving the country is termed by some economists as brain drain, the government considers it beneficial for the external balance.
Last year’s record inflows of $38bn helped partially repay external debt, boost SBP reserves, stabilise the exch­ange rate and post a current account surplus after more than a decade.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10163605792c236.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972276/hats-off-to-you-maryam-assures-bugti-of-punjabs-full-support-for-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hats off to you’: Maryam assures Bugti of Punjab’s full support for Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday paid a visit to Quetta, where she met with her Balochistan counterpart CM Sarfraz Bugti and assured him of her full support..
CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in the province.
“As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said.
She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.”







Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024, Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta.
“You have rightly said that you do not have fitna, but you have Fitna al Khawarij, which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib,” Maryam said.
The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her.
She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province. “May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added.
According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters.

According to a press release by the President’s Secretariat, the president met with Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr and handed over a letter from the Uzbek president, who had visited Pakistan for two days last week.
In his letter, Mirziyoyev thanked President Zardari, the government and the people of Pakistan for the extraordinary hospitality and warm welcome extended to him during his visit. He also expressed gratitude for being conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan’s highest civil award, as well as the honorary professorship and doctorate, according to the statement.
“President Mirziyoyev reiterated his invitation to President Zardari, earlier conveyed during their tête-à-tête,” it added, referring to the Uzbek president’s invitation to President Zardari to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”.
“President Zardari accepted the invitation and directed the concerned authorities from the Pakistani side to coordinate with their Uzbek counterparts to finalise the visit later this year.”
The president said that Pakistan attached great significance to its close brotherly relations with Uzbekistan, while underscoring the importance of effective follow-up on the outcomes of Mirziyoyev’s recent “historic and result-oriented” state visit to Pakistan, the statement said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation with Uzbekistan in “key sectors including food and agriculture, mining, information technology, tourism, health and banking”.
The president also welcomed Uzbekistan’s interest in importing halal meat, fruits and potatoes from Pakistan as a positive step towards enhancing bilateral trade, it added.
“President Zardari also conveyed his gratitude to Mirziyoyev for his message of solidarity and support following the recent terrorist attack in Islamabad,” the statement said.
Zardari reaffirmed the shared resolve of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to “continue their joint journey of peace, stability and development”.
During Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan, the two sides signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years. Meanwhile, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10155923a795b32.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972260/shc-disposes-of-petitions-challenging-detention-of-pti-workers-after-sindh-govt-withdraws-mpo-orders' target='_blank'><strong>SHC disposes of petitions challenging detention of PTI workers after Sindh govt withdraws MPO orders</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday disposed of over 100 identical petitions filed against the detention of PTI workers under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance, following the provincial government’s decision to withdraw MPO orders.
A day earlier, it emerged that the provincial government had decided to release nearly 300 PTI workers. Government sources told Dawn that the “documentary process” had already begun.
“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening, we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Following the withdrawal of MPO orders by the provincial government, the additional advocate general of Sindh appeared before the court and informed that the MPO notification had been withdrawn.
The notification was presented in court, following which the court disposed of over 100 petitions filed challenging the detention of PTI workers.
Earlier today, the SHC directed the Sindh government to withdraw the MPO orders, warning that “if the orders are not withdrawn, the court will issue orders against the authorities”.
The defence counsel, Barrister Ali Tahir, informed the court that “over 187 families were being affected by illegal detention orders”.
He alleged that the “police had illegally raided the homes of party workers”, and added that the orders went “against SHC’s decisions and principles”.
Subsequently, the provincial home department, in a notification dated February 10 and available with Dawn, withdrew the detention orders.
“The government of Sindh is pleased to withdraw all detention orders issued by the Home Department, Sindh, under section 3(1) of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), 1960, during the period from Feb 1 to Feb 9, with immediate effect,” the notification read.
“Senior superintendents of central prison & correctional facilities, Karachi, and district prison & CF, Malir, Karachi, are hereby directed to release the persons detained under the MPO, 1960, forthwith, if they are not required in any other case,” the notification said.
As per a statement issued via PTI spokesperson, Barrister Tahir had expressed hope that the detention orders would be suspended today.
More than 400 workers detained, claims PTI Sindh
In a post on X, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh welcomed the decision, stating, “Finally, the fake government of Sindh had to withdraw its unconstitutional and illegal detainment of our innocent workers and peaceful citizens”.







According to a PTI press release, Sheikh, while speaking to the media earlier, alleged that “more than 400 party workers were unlawfully abducted between Feb 1 and Feb 9”.
The PTI leader said the arrests were made on the instructions of the Sindh government.
“First, they abducted the PTI workers, then formally arrested them and later sent them to jail under MPO,” he said.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating the public to block roads, highways, and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the SHC the very next day.
On Friday, the SHC directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143136bb9c197.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972266/iran-warns-of-destructive-influence-on-diplomacy-ahead-of-netanyahus-us-trip' target='_blank'><strong>Iran warns of ‘destructive’ influence on diplomacy ahead of Netanyahu’s US trip</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Tuesday warned of “destructive” influence on diplomacy ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington for talks expected to focus on US negotiations with Tehran.
“Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei in a weekly press briefing.
“The Zionist regime has repeatedly, as a saboteur, shown that it opposes any diplomatic process in our region that leads to peace.”
Tehran and Washington resumed talks in Muscat on Friday, months after earlier negotiations collapsed following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which triggered a 12-day war.
During the conflict, Israel targeted senior Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and nuclear sites, as well as residential areas.
The United States later joined the campaign, launching its own strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iran responded with drone and missile attacks on Israel and by targeting the largest US military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar.
“The June experience was a very bad experience. Therefore, taking these experiences into account, we are determined to secure Iran’s national interests through diplomacy,” Baqaei said.
He insisted that Iran’s focus would remain strictly on the nuclear file in return for sanctions relief.
Tehran has repeatedly said it rejects any negotiations that extend beyond that issue.
On Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the Israeli premier “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”.
The talks followed threats from Washington and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier group to the region after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
Iranian authorities said the protests, which erupted in late December over the rising cost of living, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, which they said were inflamed by the United States and Israel.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1013164662c7d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-from-exile-to-edge-of-power' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman: From exile to edge of power</strong></a><br><p>Less than two months after returning from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.
If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption.

He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024.
Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.
Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.

Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman landed in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect.
“I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with Reuters in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father.

Image makeover
The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products.
Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.
“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”

Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.
He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.
From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered.

Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.
Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media.
“She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told Reuters.
Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.
He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.
“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”</p><small>2026-02-10 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143304e28c977.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972257/dar-indonesian-minister-reaffirm-trade-investment-as-key-pillars-of-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Dar, Indonesian minister reaffirm trade, investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Indonesia’s investment minister Rosan Roeslani on Tuesday reaffirmed trade and investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation.
Roeslani, who is also the chief executive officer of Indonesia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Danantara), arrived in Islamabad on Monday evening, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
On Tuesday, Dar and Roeslani met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where their discussions focused on strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia economic and investment ties, the FO said in a post on X.
Both leaders also reviewed “potential collaboration opportunities and mutually beneficial projects, including exchange of views on sovereign wealth fund models, and reaffirmed trade and investment as a key pillar of bilateral cooperation”.







The two sides also held delegation-level talks, wherein they reviewed potential cooperation avenues and projects, including the “exchange of best practices and cooperation in priority sectors such as health”.
Presentations were provided by the finance ministry, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and Board of Investment (BoI), the FO noted.
The presentations outlined Pakistan’s “investment landscape, priority sectors and facilitation mechanisms, while also seeking Indonesia’s experience and expertise, including in sovereign wealth fund structures and downstream investment”.
Dar reaffirmed the “shared commitment to longstanding bilateral relations based on mutual respect and cooperation, with mutual investment being a catalyst of Pakistan-Indonesia partnership”, the statement added.
The meeting was attended by SIFC National Coordinator Lt Gen Sarfraz Ahmed, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the BoI chairman, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, the acting foreign secretary, and other senior officials.







Upon his arrival in the capital on Monday evening, Roeslani was welcomed by the foreign ministry’s East Asia Pacific region director general and the Indonesian ambassador.
“During the visit, he will have comprehensive talks with the DPM/FM on the prospects of enhancing Pakistan-Indonesia partnership in the domain of trade and investment,” the FO had said.







Recent months have seen robust exchanges between Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto also making a two-day official visit to Pakistan in December 2025.
He had held meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, wherein the two sides agreed to enhance bilateral trade and cooperation in various sectors.
Indonesian Vice Minister of Trade Dyah Roro Esty Widya Put­­ri also visited Pakistan in January.

 

She and Commerce Minis­ter Jam Kamal Khan had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish an Indonesia-Pakistan Joint Trade Committee (JTC) to strengthen dialogue, facilitate cooperation and address opportunities and challenges in bilateral trade.
The same month, Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin had also made a visit to Pakistan, where he met with the army chief and the air chief.
He had expressed Kuala Lumpur’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad across multiple domains, the military’s media affairs wing had said.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10133215f63348e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.
“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”

 


The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.
The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge JF-17 Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.
“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.

 

“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.
“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”
According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.
The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.
Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.

This year’s Lunar New Year, ushering in the Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac, falls on February 17 and will be accompanied by an extra-long nine-day public holiday in China, running from February 15 to 23.
It’s hoped a longer holiday (last year’s break was eight days long) might prompt Chinese consumers to boost consumption by spending more on travel, meals and more this festival period.
China expects a record 9.50 billion passenger trips to be made during the 40-day spring festival holiday travel period, higher than the 9.02 billion domestic trips last year, a state planning official said on Thursday.
Here are some glimpses of Lunar New Year celebrations across China.

While the government had issued a notification appointing Justice Agha Faisal — who was nominated by the Sindh High Court (SHC) — as the judge for the task on February 4, the notification was officially published in the provincial Gazette today.
“The Commission of Inquiry will complete the inquiry within eight (08) weeks,” read the notification seen by Dawn.
The office of Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi would provide secretariat support to the commission, it added.
It should be mentioned that the Sindh government had decided to seek a judicial inquiry into the fire, which claimed at least 73 lives, took nearly two days to be fully extinguished and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
The move came after a cabinet subcommittee of the PPP-led Sindh government reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team. They discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
Though the decision followed Sindh’s major opposition parties’ unanimous rejection of the preliminary findings, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon refuted that it was due to “pressure” from the political opponents.
After conducting its own probe, the Sindh government had said multiple officials were suspended and some would face departmental action.
Terms of reference
As outlined in the Home Department’s notification earlier, the commission’s terms of reference (TORs) include ascertaining “the causes and circumstances leading to the fire incident at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre”.
It would also “examine and evaluate rescue operations for adequacy and swiftness”.

The commission was also mandated to “fix responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the incident”.
Furthermore, it would assess whether Gul Plaza’s construction was “in violation of the approved building plan, leading to difficulty in evacuation of people”.
The SHC judge was also expected to examine whether building approvals and lease extensions from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), its predecessor organisations and the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) were granted in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Further, the commission would also have to assess the “arrangements in place at Gul Plaza building for fire prevention, detection and fire-fighting by building management as required under applicable laws and safety regulations”.
It would also determine if the building management or any government department/agency had carried out fire safety audits and whether the recommendations were implemented by the building management.</p><small>2026-02-10 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101240240ad867c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
According to an ISPR statement, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.
Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.







Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.
“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.
ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.
The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.
“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.
It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.
This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.
Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.
The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.
“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.
Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.
He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10124939ce0509e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972250/pakistans-ranking-in-global-corruption-perceptions-index-edges-up-score-rises-to-28' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s ranking in global corruption perceptions index edges up; score rises to 28</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2025 improved by one point, moving from 135 out of 180 countries in 2024 to 136 out of 182 countries in 2025.
At the same time, the country’s CPI score increased by one point, from 27 in 2024 to 28 in 2025, according to Transparency International’s report published on Tuesday.
While Pakistan is undertaking commendable efforts in governance and institutional reforms, it is imperative that the recommendations of the IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment are implemented effectively. This is essential to sustain Pakistan’s upward momentum in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in the coming years, said the Chair of Transparency International Pakistan, Justice Zia Perwez.
The Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) notes that corruption is worsening globally, with even established democracies experiencing rising corruption amid a decline in leadership.
The 2025 index shows that the number of countries scoring above 80 has shrunk from 12 a decade ago to just five this year.

 

The score has changed since 2012: 31 countries improved, 50 countries declined, while 100 countries stayed the same.
This year’s CPI ranks 182 countries and territories according to the levels of public-sector corruption perceived by experts and business people.
Chair of Transparency International, Francois Velerian, said: “Corruption is not inevitable. Our research and experience as a global movement fighting corruption show there is a clear blueprint for how to hold power to account for the common good, from democratic processes and independent oversight to a free and open civil society.”
“At a time when we’re seeing a dangerous disregard for international norms from some states, we’re calling on governments and leaders to act with integrity and live up to their responsibilities to provide a better future for people around the world.”
The highest-ranked nation was Denmark, for the eighth time in a row, with a score of 89. Only a small group of 15 countries, mainly in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific, managed to get scores above 75. Of these, just five reached scores above 80.
Meanwhile, over two-thirds of countries (68 per cent) fell below 50, indicating serious corruption problems in most parts of the planet.
At the bottom of the index, the countries scoring below 25 are mostly conflict-affected and highly repressive countries, such as Venezuela, and the lowest scorers, Somalia and South Sudan, which both scored nine.
Data show that democracies, typically stronger on anti-corruption than autocracies or flawed democracies, are experiencing a worrying decline in performance. This trend spans countries such as the United States (64), Canada (75) and New Zealand (81), to various parts of Europe, such as the United Kingdom (70), France (66) and Sweden (80).
Another concerning pattern is increasing restrictions by many states on freedoms of expression, association and assembly. Since 2012, 36 of the 50 countries with significant declines in CPI scores have also experienced a reduction in civic space, TI says.
The CPI shows the stark contrast in controlling corruption between nations with strong, independent institutions, free and fair elections, and open civic space, and those ruled by repressive authoritarian regimes.
Full democracies have a CPI average of 71, while flawed democracies average 47 and authoritarian regimes just 32. Although a very small number of non-democratic countries score relatively well compared to their regional peers, and are perceived as managing a limited range of corruption types successfully, they remain exceptions.
Similarly, countries where civic space is guaranteed and protected tend to control corruption better. Those where the freedoms of expression, assembly and association are duly safeguarded are generally more resilient against corruption and score better on the CPI.
However, countries where these freedoms are lacking are more likely to lose control of corruption: 36 of the 50 countries where the CPI scores have significantly declined have also seen a reduction in civic space.
TI is calling on governments and leaders across the world to take action to strengthen justice systems, ensure independent oversight of decision-making and public spending, guarantee transparency about how political parties and election campaigns are funded, and protect civic space, democracy and media freedom.
This year, governments that fail to address their citizens’ concerns may find themselves toppled by popular protest movements. By choosing to act for the public interest, not private gain, governments and leaders can live up to their responsibilities to shape and nurture safe, fair and healthy societies where everyone can thrive, TI says.
TI CEO Maira Martini commented that at a time of climate crisis, instability and polarisation, “the world needs accountable leaders and independent institutions to protect the public interest more than ever – yet, too often, they are falling short.”
Some powerful nations have an indirect impact on corruption levels that extends well beyond their borders.
The Russian state has been accused of interfering in other countries’ elections by spreading disinformation and buying votes with the intention of influencing voters and driving instability, democratic backsliding and the narrowing of civic space.
The US government’s decision to temporarily freeze and then degrade enforcement of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act – a key anti-corruption law that prohibits corporate bribery of foreign officials – sends a dangerous signal that bribery and other corrupt practices are acceptable.
At the same time, US aid cuts to funding for overseas civil society groups that scrutinise their governments have undermined anti-corruption efforts around the world. Political leaders in various countries have also taken this as a cue to further target and restrict independent voices, such as NGOs and journalists.
The report recommended that, in order to function properly, deter potential offenders and protect people who speak out against corruption, countries’ justice systems must be shielded from interference by political or economic interests.
This includes protecting appointments and promotions from external pressure. These systems also need to be properly resourced, prosecutorial decisions must be reasoned and reviewable, and courts should publish decisions and data.
Fundamental freedoms – including a free press and the right to information – enable the active engagement of individuals and groups to promote transparency and integrity in government and business activities. Decision-makers must fully protect civil society groups and people reporting corruption, such as whistle-blowers.
They should also create a regulatory framework that enables, rather than restricts, the work of civil society organisations – including giving them access to both domestic and international funding. This will strengthen the fight against corruption by allowing civic actors to expose abuse, assist victims, foster public participation and build accountability.
When journalists are attacked or killed for investigating corruption, power cannot be held to account effectively and corruption tends to worsen.
Since 2012, in non-conflict zones worldwide, 829 journalists have been murdered. 150 were killed while covering corruption-related stories, five of them in 2025. Over 90 per cent of these killings happened in countries with a CPI score lower than 50, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan and Iraq, which are particularly dangerous for journalists reporting on corruption.

 

Citizens deserve to know who funds political parties and candidates, or who influences decisions. It is important that political finance, conflicts of interest and lobbying are regulated, documented and subject to public scrutiny to ensure that democracy is protected against potential corruption.
Transparency and limits on political donations stop rich and well-connected industry groups from being able to unfairly influence policies, budgets and public institutions to suit their own goals, rather than the public interest.
The report recommended that robust checks and balances at home, together with strong national and international prevention and detection measures, are essential to block and uncover large-scale, high-level corruption and major cross-border money laundering.To deter and punish these serious crimes, more effective enforcement systems are essential.
Overcoming pervasive and deep-rooted state corruption will require strong national coalitions to rebuild democracy and the rule of law. International enforcement in states with effective justice systems can also play a vital role by prosecuting wrongdoers and seizing stolen assets hidden abroad, to cut off their ability to operate.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10091214576662b.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972167/sindh-govt-decides-to-release-all-pti-workers-held-under-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt decides to release all PTI workers held under MPO</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday decided to release nearly 300 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers who had been detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance last week, government sources and party leaders said.
PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision.
“So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn.
She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.”
Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun.

Opposition party hopes detained activists will be freed today; claims home minister has conveyed the decision to two PTI lawmakers

“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day.
On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.
A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing.
Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call, its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities.
Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts.
“We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged.

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of Jan 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed.

 

On Monday, the investigating officer of the case brought the four prosecution witnesses before Judicial Magistrate (South) Aasim Aslam for recording of their statements under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code.
One of the witnesses, 13-year-old Aryan, son of a shopkeeper, deposed that he saw 11-year-old Huzaifa, son of the flower shop owner, playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly broke out on Jan 17.
He stated he went to the flower shop at around 10pm to meet Huzaifa before leaving the plaza. He said Huzaifa was alone at the shop and was playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly erupted.
Besides Aryan, three salesmen also recorded their statements before the judicial magistrate.
Waleed stated that on the night of the incident he was inside a shop when he heard someone’s shout that a fire had broken out. He said he stood up and saw that the fire was already raging in the artificial flower shop.
He added that he, along with some other shopkeepers, tried to remove the artificial flowers from the shop but found that they were fixed with screws.
“The fire intensified and the place was filled with smoke,” he said, adding that till then the market committee members had arrived at the spot.
He added that as the fire became uncontrollable, he stepped back and managed to escape from the plaza.
Another salesman, Hamza, 29, said that while he was busy doing the accounts of his shop, he saw a fire erupted in Shop No 193 (artificial flower shop). He said when the blaze did not subside despite attempts to douse it with water, he ran towards an exit to save his life.
Talha, 28, said that he was talking with his colleague when the fire suddenly broke out in the flower shop. He added that he and other shopkeepers tried to extinguish the blaze, but realising its intensity, they decided to save their lives.
A manslaughter case was registered on the complaint of the SHO of the Nabi Bux police station against unknown persons.

Maxwell, 64, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to discuss her relations with Epstein.
Rather than answer the committee’s questions, however, the former British socialite invoked her Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate herself.
A recording of the deposition released by the committee showed Maxwell speaking via video link, her eyes cast down at the table she was seated in a Texas prison.
She was asked about her and Epstein’s co-conspirators, whether they surrounded themselves with the rich and famous in order to “curry favor” and avoid scrutiny, and whether Trump ever engaged “in sexual activity with an individual introduced to him by you or Jeffrey Epstein.” Wearing a drab, beige uniform, Maxwell repeated the phrase “I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to silence” until the committee gave up and called off their questioning early.

 


Maxwell’s attorney, David Markus, said she would be prepared to speak publicly if granted clemency by Trump.
“If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path,” Markus said in a statement.
Markus also said that Trump and former president Bill Clinton — both of whom were once friendly with Epstein — are “innocent of any wrongdoing.”
“Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation,” he said.
Maxwell is the only person convicted of a crime in connection with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
She was convicted in 2021 of supplying underage girls to Epstein, who had ties to powerful business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics.

 

Her deposition comes amid the recent release by the Justice Department of millions of documents related to the government’s investigation into Epstein, many of which have been heavily redacted.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) passed by Congress in November compelled the Justice Department to release all of the records in its possession related to Epstein.
It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein’s victims, who numbered more than 1,000 according to the FBI.
But the EFTA said no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
Congressional access to unredacted files
Members of Congress were given access to unredacted versions of the files Monday, though only under strict, in-person visits at secure Justice Department viewing locations.
“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, told reporters, including “people who were enablers and cooperators.” The Justice Department has said no new prosecutions are expected.
Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the publicly released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files.”
Massie declined to provide their identities but said one “is pretty high up in a foreign government.” He also posted on X a sordid 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video.”







Massie said the email exchange appeared to be with “a Sultan” and that the Department of Justice should make his identity public.
Later, on CNN, Massie said prominent businessman Les Wexner was listed as a “co-conspirator” in a 2019 child sex trafficking case, in a file that had been improperly redacted. Wexner is the billionaire behind women’s retailers and lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.
The House Oversight Committee has also summoned Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, to testify about their interactions with Epstein.
The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.
Trump was once a close friend of Epstein but has not been called to testify by the Republican-controlled committee.</p><small>2026-02-10 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/100939035f024a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972243/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-in-washington-on-feb-19' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend Trump’s Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Feb 19</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first leaders’ meeting of President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
The meeting is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
The inaugural meeting will focus on Gaza’s post-war reconstruction. The official invitation underlines the expected presence of “heads of state, heads of government, and international figures”.
The summit is also expected to formalise the board’s mandate and structure.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.
These include halting Israeli ceasefire violations and securing durable peace guarantees. Such guarantees are seen as essential for reconstruction efforts to proceed. The meeting may also address mechanisms to support long-term stability.
All 22 invitees have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and it signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The charter was signed on January 22 alongside representatives from two dozen countries.
Pakistan’s participation reflects its diplomatic engagement on Gaza as Islamabad continues to support Palestinian rights and international law. Officials stress that this position remains unchanged.
The Feb 19 meeting is described as organisational and financial in nature and is also expected to function as a fundraising conference. Discussions will define the board’s structure, mandate, and secretariat.
Operational direction is also expected to be clarified. Diplomatic sources said troop contributions may be discussed and any decision would follow completion of the board’s framework.
President Trump launched the Board of Peace late last month. It is part of his broader Gaza peace and transition plan. Trump will chair the meeting in Washington. He has framed the initiative as a vehicle for reconstruction and cooperation.
Analysts have welcomed the stated objectives of the board, while others have raised concerns about its wider implications. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to meet President Trump on February 18, is expected to attend the talks; however, his participation has not yet been officially confirmed.
The moot will focus on the implementation of the ceasefire and Gaza’s future governance.
The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.
This expansive mandate has drawn mixed global reactions. Several Western allies have expressed reservations. Concerns focus on structure, financing, and long-term authority.
Some countries have chosen not to participate. Islamabad has adopted a cautious approach to engagement. Officials stress Pakistan’s participation is not unconditional.
Pakistan aims to advocate Palestinian self-determination.
Diplomats say Islamabad seeks alignment with UN resolutions, and international law remains central to its position.
Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi earlier outlined Pakistan’s stance, stressing a lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access, and reconstruction.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán confirmed his attendance, along with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, who has also indicated that he will attend. So have half a dozen other Muslim states.
Some countries, including India, are expected to skip the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1010142190a8231.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972246/massive-fire-at-textile-factory-in-rawalpindis-rawat-area-extinguished-after-16-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Massive fire at textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat area extinguished after 16 hours</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: A massive blaze at a textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat industrial estate was extinguished on Tuesday after a 16-hour effort, according to a statement from Rescue 1122.
The fire broke out on Monday evening. No loss of life was reported in the incident.
More than 80 personnel and 21 emergency vehicles were engaged in the overnight firefighting efforts, said the statement.
It added that more than 200,000 litres of water were used, along with foam, to control the blaze. Fire tenders and firefighters from neighbouring districts were also summoned.
Firefighters, after extinguishing the blaze, continued cooling efforts. The statement added that cracks have developed in the structure and there is a risk of collapse.
The cause of the fire had yet to be established, as it was too early to determine; however, fire investigators and rescuers were present at the scene.
A day earlier, the fire, which was initially declared a second-degree blaze, caused extensive property damage and sparked panic in the area.
Up to 45 firefighters, along with 13 emergency vehicles, struggled to control the fire.
Fire services from Bahria Town and Islamabad, along with Wasa Rawalpindi, were also called in to assist the firefighting operation.
Huge plumes of thick black smoke billowed over the industrial area and could be seen from miles away.
Earlier this month, it had emerged that all high-rise buildings in the garrison city had been served notices to adopt fire safety measures within 30 days.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1008284482c308d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972178/senate-committee-flags-delays-in-road-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Senate committee flags delays in road projects</strong></a><br><p>• Seeks mechanism to avoid simultaneous execution of multiple schemes• Another panel told of $40m annual corruption in KPT container clearance
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed concern over delays in the execution of road infrastructure projects across the country and urged the formulation of a mechanism to avoid the simultaneous execution of multiple projects.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Communications, headed by Pervaiz Rashid, suggested that initiating and completing projects one at a time would help prevent cost escalation and ensure timely completion.
It further recommended consultation with the Planning Commission in devising such a mechanism.
The committee chairman directed that clear responsibility be fixed for project delays and that escalation costs be borne by those responsible.
The committee reviewed the budgetary allocations and releases for the current financial year and examined the proposed budget for the next financial year. It was informed that a major portion of the National Highway Authority (NHA) budget consists of PSDP-funded projects.
Senator Jam Saifullah Khan emphasised that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway should be treated as a priority project and directed that progress updates be presented at every committee meeting.
The Senate body also discussed issues related to the dilapidated condition of roads raised during Senate proceedings, received a briefing on ongoing NHA projects, and reviewed the implementation status of the approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula.
The committee also discussed issues concerning the deteriorating condition of motorways and the Lowari Tunnel. Serious concerns were raised regarding safety, ventilation and quality standards, particularly in view of the strategic importance of the tunnel.
The committee was also briefed on the progress of the Chakdara-Chitral and Gilgit-Shandur road projects.
The Senate body received a briefing on the implementation of the PM-approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula for ongoing projects. The committee noted that delays in the implementation of the formula could further increase contractors’ claims and termed such delays contrary to the prime minister’s directives.
The chairman directed the NHA chief to address the matter promptly and sub­­mit quarterly progress reports to the committee.
Corruption at KPT
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Maritime Affairs on Monday observed that annual corruption worth $40 million has been reported through various sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT), mainly linked with container clearance.
Chairman of the committee, Senator Faisal Vawda, stressed the need to vacate encroached land.
“We have received information that 239 containers are delayed at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), mainly due to customs delays, and it is estimated that corruption worth approximately $40m annually is linked to container clearance,” he said. He added that informants have alleged that Rs112,000 in bribes is taken per container.
The committee directed the KICT to clear the backlog and eliminate corruption.
Senator Vawda also raised concerns regarding the Fisheries Harbour Authority, stating that transparency is lacking and significant land mismanagement has taken place at Korangi Fisheries.
Senator Rubina Qaim Khani pointed out that the KPT faces dwell time issues in container clearance.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar told the committee that it is not possible to eliminate all systemic issues at once, but the ministry is adopting a step-by-step approach.

ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice.
Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations.
The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream.
However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad.
With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country.
Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked.
He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity.
PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed.
“This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first.
Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests.
“If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis.
“What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces.
“All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said.
However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”.
Framing of cultural event
Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said.
However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes.
Lawmakers from both sides blamed one another for the ongoing menace of terrorism.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who returned in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.
The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.
Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.
“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.
“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.
Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.
‘Justice’
Hasina was overthrown on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.
The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.
“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.
“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.
“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”
‘Long live the revolution’
Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.
“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.
“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.
“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”

ISLAMABAD: In a rapid move, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
The contractual changes were introduced through a predetermined set of regulations that had been published as draft for public opinion but were notified without any change after a public hearing. The notification effectively terminates the existing net-metering regime and replaces it with net-billing for all.
As a result, earlier public pronouncements by officials and ministers that the terms of contracts with existing prosumers would remain unchanged until completion of their seven-year terms have proven incorrect. Under the new regulations, the existing registered prosumers will be shifted immediately to net-billing instead of net-metering, and their export units will be credited for one month only instead of the current three months. All other existing terms will remain unchanged until expiry of their seven-year contracts.
New prosumers will be granted only five-year contracts, and their export units will be accepted at Rs11 per unit compared to Rs26 under the existing contracts. Consumers’ import units from distribution companies (Discos) will now be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit, depending on the relevant slab, excluding taxes, surcharges and duties.
Surplus generation exported to Discos will be calculated separately — at Rs26 per unit for existing and around Rs10 per unit for future prosumers. The net difference will be billed to consumers, unlike the existing system of unit-for-unit exchange in import and export.

 

Nepra held a marathon public hearing on Friday evening but restricted dozens of relevant consumers, independent think tanks and business representatives from suggesting alternative solutions. By the afternoon of the first working day, the regulator notified the same draft without changing a single clause, indicating a predetermined conclusion.
Earlier, the Power Division had proposed similar changes multiple times but withdrew after public criticism over unilateral changes to consumer-financed contracts under a properly announced renewable policy in 2015.
Both the government side and the regulator have blamed prosumers with higher-than-approved solar capacity and non-metered solar homeowners for grid challenges and higher capacity charges. However, the new regulations appear silent on both counts.
The Power Division claimed on-grid (metered) solar capacity had reached 7,000MW and off-grid exceeded 13,000MW. The power minister said millions of consumers had installed hybrid systems without meters to remain in subsidised categories, pushing capacity beyond 19,000MW outside metering. The new rules target only metered solar consumers.
Under the regulations, at the end of each billing cycle following the interconnection of a distributed generation facility, Discos will raise bills after accounting for electricity generated and consumed by the prosumer “under a net-billing arrangement”. Units supplied by Discos to prosumers will be billed at the applicable tariff (Rs37-55 per unit excluding taxes), while units supplied by prosumers to Discos will be billed at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
Net-billing means electricity generated by a prosumer’s distributed facility is purchased by Disco, and a bill is raised on consumption at Rs37-55 per unit after credit for electricity supplied by the prosumer at NAEPP. “In case the billed amount of the units supplied by prosumers exceeds the billed amount of units supplied by Disco, the net billed amount shall be credited against the prosumer’s next billing cycle or shall be paid by the licensee to the prosumer quarterly,” Nepra stated. Discos, however, have not made such payments in the past.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will not be allowed to install solar systems for net-metering beyond their original sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Existing prosumers’ contracts will remain valid until expiry of their current seven-year term, after which they may request a five-year extension, subject to Discos’ willingness. The new regulations apply to systems ranging from one kilowatt to one megawatt (1kW to 1MW) under Nepra’s direct regulatory and licensing domain.
At present, consumers below 25kW are licensed directly by Discos.
The solar regulation changes have been notified despite Nepra itself repeatedly blaming power companies for unaffordable and inefficient supplies.
“Compounded by heavy taxes, levies and surcharges, particularly the Debt Servicing Surcharge, these factors collectively inflate electricity costs for consumers. The result is a shifting of consumers towards decentralised or off-grid solutions, further weakening demand for grid-based electricity,” Nepra said recently.
The regulator stated that the new prosumer regulations provide clearer procedures, stricter technical requirements and a shift in billing methodology, aiming to better integrate small-scale generation into the national grid while safeguarding system stability.
Another restriction is a capacity cap at the transformer level. Discos are barred from entertaining new applications if the cumulative distributed generation capacity connected to a particular distribution transformer reaches 80pc of its rated capacity, to avoid overloading and technical instability in local distribution networks.

The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.
In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.







“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.
It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.
“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.
“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.
“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.
Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game on hai (the game is on)!”
“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.







“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.
Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to play match
Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.
“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.







The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.
“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not cancelling the tour of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.
Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run PTV on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.
He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.
“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.







Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.
“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.
No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC
Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.
In a statement, the ICC said that it had concluded an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.
“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.







The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.
Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.
It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.
The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.
“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.
The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.
Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.
“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.
It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.
“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read
ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.
“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.
He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.
Earlier this month, the government had given the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6987a9d8d26d9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971509/athletics-the-running-child' target='_blank'><strong>ATHLETICS: THE RUNNING CHILD</strong></a><br><p>When nine-year-old Kainat Khalil finished ahead of adult runners on Pakistan’s road-running circuit, her performance should have been recognised as an extraordinary display of talent. Instead, it ignited a controversy that has exposed deep inconsistencies in sports governance, weak child-safeguarding mechanisms and the selective enforcement of age-eligibility rules.
Kainat was recently stopped from officially competing in the 21-kilometre half marathon at the recent BYD Karachi Marathon 2026, despite having been registered and allowed to start the race. 
Although she recorded one of the strongest times on the course, organisers later declared her ineligible, awarding her an honorary prize instead and publicly criticising her coach for entering a child in a long-distance event.
The incident followed an earlier episode at the National Games 2025, where Kainat was barred from competing in the 5,000-metre race after having already won a bronze medal in the 10,000 metres. In both instances, intervention came only after the child had competed — and succeeded.

Kainat Khalil recently won a half-marathon but was not awarded a medal. She also won a bronze in a 10,000m event but was stopped from competing in the 5,000m event. The reason: she is only nine years old. Why are sports rules being enforced only once a child wins?

AN EMERGING ATHLETE
A third-grade student, Kainat has been running competitively for just over a year. In that time, she has participated in several high-profile events, finishing third in the 5km race at the Governor House Karachi Marathon and securing podium positions at the Green Karachi Marathon, the Pakistan Day Marathon, the Maarka-i-Haq Marathon and the Shuhada Run.
Most controversially, she completed and won a 21km half marathon — a distance typically reserved for fully developed adult athletes.
“I want to win a gold medal for Pakistan,” Kainat says briefly, reflecting the ambition driving her rapid rise.
Her performances drew widespread attention and media coverage. They also attracted scrutiny — but only after she began outperforming established runners.
RULES APPLIED AFTER THE FINISH LINE
According to Kainat’s coach, Abu Bakar, objections surfaced only when the child defeated institutional teams.
“She won bronze in the 10,000 metres against runners from Wapda, Navy and Army,” he says. “That is when questions about her age suddenly became an issue.”
Despite being cleared during trials, Kainat was subsequently barred from the 5,000-metre race. Officials cited age restrictions and health concerns — rules that, critics note, had long existed.
“Young children take part in trials regularly,” Mr Bakar said. “No one raises objections until a child wins.”
Several athletics officials, speaking privately, acknowledged that age-eligibility rules are applied inconsistently. Kainat had competed in multiple races without objection, including events where significant prize money was awarded.
This inconsistency raises a critical question: are regulations being enforced to protect children, or to preserve competitive hierarchies?

GENDER, CLASS AND MEDICAL RISK
Kainat’s father, Khalil Ahmed, a driver earning approximately 30,000 rupees per month, believes social attitudes may also have shaped how his daughter’s case was handled.
“We were told many times to focus on a son instead of a daughter,” he says. “I asked them, if a son has rights, does a daughter not?”
Sports analysts note that children from lower-income backgrounds — particularly girls — often lack institutional backing, sponsorship and access to elite training environments that might otherwise offer protection or guidance.
Sports medicine experts, however, caution against romanticising early success in endurance sports. Dr Ucksy Mallick, a sports medicine specialist, explains that children under 12 are biologically unprepared for long-distance competition.
“They have open growth plates, immature cardiovascular systems and limited heat regulation,” he says. “Events such as 10,000 metres or half marathons carry serious health risks at this age, regardless of performance.”
These risks include growth plate injuries, chronic overuse damage, heat illness and cardiac strain. Medical clearance, he stresses, cannot substitute for age-appropriate competition structures. “Physical ability does not mean biological readiness,” Dr Mallick says.
However, experts emphasise that these concerns highlight administrative failure rather than justifying post-race disqualification.
A SYSTEM THAT INTERVENES TOO LATE
By allowing a child to register, compete and finish — and then intervening publicly — authorities failed to protect the athlete at the point where protection mattered most.
Psychologists warn that repeated disqualifications after competition can cause confusion, anxiety and emotional distress in young athletes, particularly when they do not understand why success results in punishment.
Kainat’s case reflects not over-regulation, but delayed and selective intervention.
Following the controversies, her coach says Kainat’s future participation will be limited to shorter distances, with a focus on long-term junior development. Medical experts, however, caution that even 10,000 metres may be excessive at her age — underscoring the absence of clear, nationally enforced youth-distance guidelines.
Ultimately, Kainat Khalil’s case is about more than one gifted child. It exposes systemic weaknesses in Pakistan’s athletics ecosystem: inconsistent rule enforcement, lack of child-centred policy, weak medical oversight and persistent gender and class disparities.
If age rules exist to protect children, critics ask, why are they enforced only after a child wins?
Until that question is answered — through transparent eligibility checks, consistent enforcement and robust safeguarding — Pakistan risks failing both its most-talented young athletes and its fundamental responsibility to protect them.

He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League.
But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. 
The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. 
Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016.

Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative…

The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media.
When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. 
Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh.
A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE
A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. 
Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime.
Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention.
The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree.
The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders.
Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.”
Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds.
The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters.
Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman.
According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before.
Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure.
The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy.

THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY 
Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.”
He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. 
“Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds.
Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.”
However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. 
Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds.
An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. 
Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP.
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?”
Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.”
Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. 
The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says.
Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice.
The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.”

FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER
The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979.
The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster.
Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. 
Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support.
Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. 
“People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems.
Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos.
Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds.
The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. 
By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations.
Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025.
Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public.
It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. 
What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.
