A deal under which Islamabad will take delivery of eight Hangor-class submarines by 2028 is “progressing smoothly,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year was a major milestone for naval collaboration between the two countries.
Admiral Ashraf further said that the project was not only significant for the advancement of the Pakistan Navy’s submarine force capabilities, but would also contribute toward self-reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works, the report said.
He said that the Type 054A/P frigates marked another major achievement in China-Pakistan naval cooperation. The publication reported that such multirole frigates were already in service with the Pakistan Navy, quoting Admiral Ashraf as saying that they are “among the most advanced surface combatants”.
Admiral Ashraf also told the Global Times that these Chinese-made frigates had greatly strengthened the navy’s multi-mission capability, particularly in air defence, anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance.
“These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region, which is critical for global economy,” he was quoted as saying.
The update on the Chinese submarine deal follows the Pakistan Air Force using Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets in May to shoot down an Indian Air Force Rafale aircraft, made by France.
The altercation between the nuclear-armed neighbours surprised many in the military community and raised questions over the superiority of Western hardware over Chinese alternatives.
 
 

Under the terms of the submarine agreement — reportedly worth up to $5 billion — the first four diesel-electric attack submarines will be built in China, with the remaining vessels assembled in Pakistan to improve the nation’s technical capabilities.
Pakistan has already launched three of the submarines into China’s Yangtze River from a shipyard in the central province of Hubei.
“Chinese-origin platforms and equipment have been reliable, technologically advanced and well-suited to Pakistan Navy’s operational requirements,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times, adding that the navy’s experience with them had been positive, both in terms of performance and technical support.
“As modern warfare evolves, emerging technologies such as unmanned systems, artificial intelligence and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important. The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China,” Ashraf was quoted as saying.
Islamabad has long been Beijing’s top arms customer, and over the 2020-2024 period bought over 60 per cent of China’s weapons exports, data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.
On the topic of China-Pakistan naval cooperation in the future, Admiral Ashraf said the Pakistan Navy’s partnership with China was built on deep-rooted friendship, mutual respect, trust and shared strategic interests.
“In the coming decade, we expect this relationship to grow, encompassing not only shipbuilding and training, but also enhanced interoperability, research, technology sharing and industrial collaboration,“ he was quoted as saying.
“There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies, unmanned systems, marine scientific research and maritime industry development. Together, we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity,” he further said, adding that China has been a “trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy’s modernisation journey”.
He further said that the introduction of advanced frigates and submarines had significantly enhanced the Pakistan Navy’s operational reach, multi-domain war fighting capabilities, and deterrence posture, the publication reported.
He said that these platforms, along with joint training and exercises with China, had deepened the two sides’ professional synergy and strengthened interoperability at sea, noting that “this cooperation goes beyond hardware; it reflects a shared strategic outlook, mutual trust, and a long-standing partnership”.</p><small>2025-11-03 05:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0310000189f2adb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952901/powerful-63-magnitude-quake-kills-at-least-10-in-afghanistan-scores-injured' target='_blank'><strong>Powerful 6.3-magnitude quake kills at least 10 in Afghanistan, scores injured</strong></a><br><p>A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif early on Monday, killing at least 10 people and injuring about 260, authorities said, with the death toll likely to rise.
The US Geological Survey said the quake hit at a depth of 28 km (17.4 miles) near Mazar-i-Sharif, which has a population of about 523,000.
 






“A total of 150 people injured and seven martyred have been reported and transferred to health centres as of this morning,” Samim Joyanda, the spokesperson for the health department in Samangan, a mountainous northern province near Mazar-e Sharif told Reuters.
The toll was based on hospital reports collected as of Monday morning, he said.
The Afghan Taliban defence ministry said parts of Balkh and Samangan provinces were the most affected, resulting in fatalities among a number of citizens.
Military Rescue and emergency assistance teams reached the area immediately and began operations to rescue people, transport the injured, and assist affected families, it said in a statement.
 






Health ministry spokesperson Sharfat Zaman said rescue teams were active and the numbers of dead and injured might rise.
“Health teams have arrived in the area, and all nearby hospitals have been put on standby,” Zaman said in a statement.
The USGS issued an orange alert in its PAGER system, which is an automated system that produces information on the impact of earthquakes, and indicated that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.
Active faults
Afghanistan is particularly vulnerable to quakes as it lies on two active faults that have the potential to rupture and cause extensive damage.
More than 2,200 people were killed and thousands more injured after a quake and strong aftershocks in the southeast of the war-shattered country at the end of August.
Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response, the system’s alert added.
The earthquake destroyed part of the holy shrine of Mazar-i-Sharif, Balkh province spokesperson Haji Zaid said, referring to the Blue Mosque.
Videos of rescue efforts being carried out to save people trapped under rubble and images of fallen debris in buildings were shared on the social media platform X. One video showed rescuers pulling what appeared to be dead bodies from rubble.
Reuters could not immediately verify the footage and the images.</p><small>2025-11-03 04:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0309374228506b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952828/2-booked-for-human-trafficking-after-newborn-taken-away-from-destitute-mother-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>2 booked for human trafficking after newborn taken away from destitute mother in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Two women employees of a private medical facility in Malir — including a doctor — have been booked for human trafficking after they took away a newborn whose family could not afford the medical expenses of the childbirth.
Police said that the baby, who was later sold to someone in Punjab, had been recovered and returned to his parents, while the health facility had been sealed.
On Nov 1, Sarang Khan, the newborn child’s father, lodged a case with Memon Goth police under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 and 34 Section of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Memon Goth police officer Fayaz Jokhio told Dawn on Sunday that the baby boy had been recovered from Lahore. “Raids are being held to arrest the nominated suspects,” he added.
In the FIR, Mr Khan told the police he was a resident of a village in Nooriabad and a labourer by trade. His wife (Maheen) was pregnant and she left for her parents’ home after developing some differences with him around three to four months ago.
She was taken to a private clinic in Murad Memon Goth on October 5 by her mother Mrs Shahnaz to deliver the baby.
After the medical check-up, a doctor suggested an operation and asked them to make the required payment.
When Mrs Shahnaz said that they were poor and did not have the money to bear the cost of the operation, the doctor allegedly told them of a woman who would “help the poor and adopt their children”, while also paying for medical expenses.
The complainant claimed that his wife and mother-in-law agreed to this proposal, and the baby boy was handed over to the woman, who turned out to be another employee at the same medical facility.
The complainant claimed that his wife and his mother-in-law kept the incident from him, adding that he came to know through relatives that he was blessed with a male child, but he had been given up for adoption at the hospital.
Published in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-11-03 04:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69080ae955173.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952889/the-ro-ruse' target='_blank'><strong>The RO ruse</strong></a><br><p>THE Election Commission of Pakistan’s recommendation to parliament that the election law be amended in favour of appointing judicial officers as District Returning Officers (DROs) and Returning Officers (ROs) is nothing short of an adverse comment on the performance of executive officers appointed to these positions to conduct General Election 2024 (GE-2024). This recommendation is part of the ECP’s post-election review annexed with its statutory annual report laid before the National Assembly in September.
GE-2024 was challenged by opposition parties who alleged that ROs had manipulated the results. The ECP had appointed 144 DROs and 266 and 593 ROs for the national and provincial assembly constituencies, respectively, mostly drawn from the district management group. The ECP, however, believes that ROs from the judiciary have a better understanding of the laws and rules and hence can undertake poll activities more smoothly than executive ROs, who also command the district administrative machinery — necessary for the smooth conduct of any election.
 
 

Many candidates blamed ROs in their constituencies for manipulating results (Forms 47 and 48) while expressing confidence in the results (Form 45) prepared at polling stations. Some alleged that the ROs were under pressure from the establishment, while others claimed that a ‘winning’ Form 48 was sold to the highest bidder. However, no allegation of foul play could be proved in court, nor does the ECP appear to have initiated an inquiry.
It is against this backdrop that the ECP’s recommendation becomes significant — almost a vindication of the allegations that executive officers did not perform their duties in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. In fact, the report itself suggests that despite comprehensive training, “first-time ROs faced certain difficulties in performing the electoral activities”, indicating that the law and rules might not have been enforced as intended. The nature of these “difficulties” needs further elaboration to ensure they did not “materially affect” the result of any constituency. The ECP may also wish to clarify the number of first-time ROs and correlate the alleged irregularities with the constituencies of their appointments.
But it was not just the naïveté of “first-time ROs” that concerned the ECP; it was also their inaccessibility to perform poll duties. While the election law is explicit that any official appointed or deputed to perform election duties “shall be deemed to be under the control, superintendence, and discipline of the Commission…,” these executive officials were not easily accessible to the ECP. “…DROs and ROs, being administrative officers, remained involved in performing their principal duties and were not easily accessible for electoral duties,” reads the report.

The conduct of judicial officers in Pakistan has not always been above board.

Their inaccessibility is a serious offence and falls within the purview of another provision of the law, whose violation empowers the ECP to take strict punitive measures. If DROs and ROs were not easily accessible for poll duties, they breached Section 55 (3)(e), which bars any official on election duty from disobeying or avoiding compliance with any instruction issued by the ECP. Such inaccessibility goes beyond mere avoidance; it reflects disregard for the direct superintendence of a constitutional entity. Whether the ECP used its powers to penalise the “inaccessible” officials isn’t known.
 
 

Instead of invoking its punitive powers to improve enforcement, the ECP has now asked parliament to amend Elections Act, 2017, by adding a provision to sub-section 1(c) of Section 50 binding the chief justices of the high courts to provide judicial officers for appointment as DROs and ROs when requested by the ECP. The binding clause has likely been proposed because the chief justices had refused a similar request by the ECP for GE-2024.
However, Pakistan’s electoral history shows that the conduct of judicial officers has not always been above board. The PTI, for instance, alleged foul play by ROs drawn from the lower judiciary during GE-2013. Although a subsequent judicial commission led by the then Supreme Court chief justice ruled out allegations of rigging, it acknowledged “shortcomings of the ECP” in conducting the elections, including a disconnect between the ECP and ROs, implying that the latter may have acted independently. The ECP itself noted this in an April 2013 press release after several political parties raised concerns about how ROs were conducting candidate scrutiny.
The recommendation also raises a constitutional question. Article 220 binds only the executive authorities in the federation and provinces to assist the ECP in the discharge of its functions. Meanwhile, Article 175(3) provides for the separation of the judiciary from the executive. Binding chief justices to comply with the ECP’s requests may then need a constitutional amendment. Moreover, appointing judicial officers as DROs and ROs creates an institutional conflict of interest, as poll petitions are heard — under the existing law — by judges of the same high courts whose chief justices would be involved in appointing the lower court judges serving as DROs and ROs.
Interestingly, the ECP has again taken an evasive position in its report, reasoning why it should not take direct responsibility for conducting poll processes at the constituency level. It may not have enough officials to fill all RO positions, but it can certainly appoint DROs from among its own ranks. The ECP should assume direct supervision of electoral processes by appointing district election commissioners as DROs and seek legal reforms to strengthen this position. In their capacity as DROs, DECs can continue to “coordinate multifarious electoral activities and provide technical assistance” to ROs — the very justification the ECP has given for not appointing them to roles directly related to the conduct of polls.
There is ample evidence that the quality of elections managed directly by ECP officials as DROs and ROs is far better than those managed by ‘borrowed’ officers. Such oversight at the district level is crucial to keeping ROs — whether drawn from the executive or the judiciary — in line and ensuring that elections are conducted in accordance with the law and rules. The ECP can best serve its constitutional mandate only when it assumes micro-level supervision of the entire electoral process and uses its punitive powers to ensure full compliance by all officials. Judicial officers are not the panacea for democratic disorder, which remains rooted in the public’s distrust of the electoral process.

Powerful states and regional powers are using coercive power to try to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force has become an option of first resort for them and the principal means of ‘resolving’ disputes. Attacks by stronger countries on the sovereignty of their adversaries or weaker states have become all too frequent. Some of these aggressive actions are disingenuously called pre-emptive wars. Israel’s war on Gaza, its attacks on Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Qatar, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force and violation of international law.
This new era of escalation and growing insecurity has renewed thinking among countries about nuclear weapons. Iran and Ukraine were attacked by nuclear powers. An NPT-member state, Iran was bombed by two nuclear-weapon states. This has encouraged more countries to see nuclear weapons as a guarantor of security. The lesson security-challenged countries may have drawn from recent events is that without nuclear weapons they are more vulnerable to external aggression and attacks on their sovereignty.
The annual 2025 SIPRI report highlights the potential for more countries to consider developing or hosting nuclear weapons. This at a time when the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-weapon states are being enlarged and upgraded and arms control efforts have come to a halt. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that the US will resume nuclear testing seems a response to Russia’s claim to have tested a long-range, nuclear-powered cruise missile. But it is a dangerous move that will further erode a fraying nonproliferation regime. In the annual resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly’s First Committee last week, the US was the only country to vote ‘no’ — for the first time.
 
 

A newly published book by Serhii Plokhy is a timely assessment of the nuclear issue and why countries have sought the bomb. The Nuclear Age: An Epic Race for Arms, Power and Survival is a tour de force of the history of nuclear weapons development and the geopolitics behind it, focusing on what motivated countries to acquire them. It is a cautionary tale about the perils of weapons that can annihilate all humanity. Plokhy writes that since the American acquisition of the bomb, the nuclear arms race never really ceased except in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the US and Soviet Union agreed on disarmament measures and several countries were persuaded or forced to give up their nuclear programmes. That lull ended in 1998 with nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Israel acquired a nuclear weapons capability decades earlier, in the late 1960s/ early ’70s with significant French and some British help. By 2006, North Korea also joined the nuclear club. Meanwhile, Iran continued its nuclear programme.

If fear is a key motivation to go nuclear more countries may be encouraged by today’s turbulent world.

With nuclear-weapon states upgrading their arsenals and no arms limitation efforts to restrain them, Plokhy argues the world is in a more dangerous place than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis because an uncontrolled arms race raises the chances of nuclear war, by accident or otherwise. He says a new threat emerged with Russia’s attack on Ukraine’s nuclear installations and Russian leaders threatening to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. Although he doesn’t mention this, Israel and America’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites takes that threat to another level.
Plokhy is concerned with drawing lessons from the first nuclear arms race that can help stop or control the next one. The crux of his book lies in assessing why some countries built the bomb while others gave up trying to acquire one. This is a question long discussed in the rich literature on the subject with motivating factors ascribed to prestige, security, power projection, domestic politics and leaders’ ambitions. Plokhy’s core argument is that whatever the combination of motives, the fear factor is decisive — “fear of nuclear attack by another state or of superior conventional forces possessed by an adversary”. Thus states’ “concerns about their security, represented by the emotion of fear, is paramount for understanding why they go nuclear”. Fear, he says, can generate different reactions, some irrational, others grounded in actual security threats.
Fear has produced paradoxical effects in nuclear history, both fuelling the arms race and making it more manageable and predictable. Fear of the nuclear balance of terror among adversaries led to arms control and reduction agreements during the Cold War. What worries the author is that in today’s unregulated global nuclear environment, fear can ignite a more dangerous phase of the arms race. He offers prudent advice. “We have to relearn how to manage our fear, recall how dangerous nuclear brinkmanship can be and recognise how important it is not to become a victim of nuclear blackmail and encourage the adventurism of nuclear rivals.”
What about the factors behind South Asia’s nuclear trajectory? Pakistan’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability was unambiguously security-driven. Two key developments shaped the decision. First, the Indian intervention in Pakistan’s dismemberment and military defeat in 1971. The second turning point was India’s 1974 nuclear explosion. The never-again thinking that followed 1971 — and fear of more Indian aggression — led to the strategic conclusion that Pakistan could only rely on itself for its security. Feroze Khan, author of the seminal book about Pakistan’s nuclear quest, Eating Grass, explains that “Pakistan’s humiliation [in 1971] laid the foundation for a shift in the once peaceful nature of the nuclear programme” to one aimed at acquiring the bomb.
 
 

India’s motivation to go nuclear was driven less by security and more by its quest for great-power status and prestige, as George Perkovich and others have also pointed out. Khan says it was also about competition with China, which motivated both India’s 1974 and 1998 tests. The 1962 Sino-Indian conflict acted as added incentive.
Given the current global turbulence and surge in regional rivalries, Plokhy’s book ends with a stark warning. The world may see 40 additional nuclear-armed countries which would dramatically increase the threat of intentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons. A sobering thought for a deeply troubled world.

With regard to the possible deployment of Pakistani troops as part of the International Stabilisation Force in occupied Gaza, mixed messages from official quarters have added to the confusion, and allowed inimical actors to manufacture unverified claims regarding this country’s future role in the Strip.
Take the case of comments reportedly made by Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Danyal Chaudhry. Talking to a local TV channel, Mr Chaudhry said Pakistan’s role in Gaza would be to ensure “there is no extremism” or cross-border attacks.
By this, we assume he means no more attacks from occupied Palestinian territory into Israel. Asked if the foreign troops’ mission would include the disarmament of Hamas, he replied: “absolutely”. The remarks have drawn criticism from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who questioned the statements his colleague made.
 
 

Indeed, Mr Chaudhry’s troubling comments seem to suggest that Pakistan is considering the Gaza mission not to protect the Strip’s Palestinian population and ensure rehabilitation and reconstruction, but to enforce the US-Israeli plan for the territory. We hope this is not the case. But it is a fact that hostile actors are using such unguarded comments to construct dubious narratives.
For example, an Indian TV channel had reported that Pakistan had removed the restriction that the green passport was valid for all countries except Israel, along with specifying the number of troops this country had allegedly committed to the Gaza mission. The information ministry said these foreign reports were fabricated. However, unless there is a coherent, unified official narrative, conspiracy theories and half-truths will spread regarding Pakistan’s role due to the state’s confused messaging.
 
 

To prevent the spread of inaccuracies regarding Pakistan’s role, only the Foreign Office should be mandated to speak on the Palestine issue and other matters of import in global affairs. This would eliminate chances of contradictory messages being issued by officials. Regarding the actual mission in Gaza, there needs to be a parliamentary debate to bring clarity to the matter.
Pakistani officials have repeatedly said the national policy on Palestine remains unchanged, and that this country stands with the Palestinian people. The message should be amplified by parliament, with a clear mandate regarding what role, if any, Pakistan forces will play in Gaza. If the aim is to protect Palestinian civilians from Israeli brutality, bring in aid and help rebuild the devastated Strip, then Pakistan can consider participation.
However, if there are some other considerations, such as enforcing American and Israeli plans to dismantle the Palestinian resistance, and relegating the question of an independent Palestinian state to the back-burner, Pakistan should stay away from such schemes.

A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the findings had been submitted to the premier in a sealed envelope, who is likely to decide the fate of the probe in “a day or so”.
In August, the PM had suspended eight senior Nat­ional Highway Authority (NHA) officials and for­med a committee to probe irregularities in the award of the contract, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
The inquiry committee included retired federal secretary Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmed as its convener, the commerce division secretary; retired NHA member Mukhtar Ahmed Durrani, retired chief engineer Akbar Ali, and a planning commission member.
The committee was asked to review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; examine whether the NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of Carec Tranche-III project; assess whether the NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process in a transparent and judicious manner; evaluate all stages in the award of the project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; suggest a way forward on the current process; and review any other matter ancillary to the above.

The PMO source said nobody except the inquiry committee was aware of their decision.
The Economic Affairs Division committee, however, had recently questioned how the PM’s inquiry committee would reach a decision, given that the National Highway Authority had failed to provide relevant documents to the Senate committee for the past four months.
The Carec Tranche-III project has also come under scrutiny in five standing committees of the Senate and the National Assembly and the Public Procu­rement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
In September, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division recommended blacklisting a joint venture of three firms, which were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor Asian Development Bank to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
Carec is an Asian Development Bank-supported initiative which was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region. Tranche I, II and III road projects are underway or have been completed. Tranche-III has four lots as Lot-1 (58km road from Rajanpur to Jampur), Lot-2 (64km from Jampur to DG Khan), Lot-3 (112km from DG Khan to Tibbi Qaisrani), and Lot-4 (96km from Tibbi Qaisrani to DI Khan).

Within days, someone in the group begins messaging him privately, offering virtual coins in exchange for “fun” pictures. At first, it feels like a game. Then come the threats that the photos will be shared unless he sends more. It sounds extreme, but incidents like this are happening daily, often silently, across Pakistan’s fast-expanding digital landscape.
Pakistan now ranks 8th among countries with the largest internet user base, with 82.9 million internet users and 71.7m active social media accounts as of 2022. Internet penetration stands at 36.5 per cent of the total population, and it grew by 22m new users in a single year. The country also has 186.9m mobile connections, a number that shows how deeply technology has penetrated every layer of society. Yet, while connectivity has surged, digital literacy and child safety mechanisms have not kept pace.
With the country’s median age around 22 years, millions of minors use digital devices unsupervised. The National Commission on the Rights of Child report on Child Online Protection reveals an alarming rise in exposure to online risks, from cyberbullying to sexual exploitation. In 2022, over 2m cases of child sexual abuse material were linked to users in Pakistan through global reporting systems. However, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) recorded just 250 cases locally in the same year. This gap reflects not a lack of crime but a lack of reporting, detection, and coordination.
 
 

The problem lies partly in awareness and partly in enforcement. Parents and teachers, often digital immigrants themselves, rarely have the tools to understand online grooming, sextortion, or the dark patterns of social media. Schools generally focus on academic content, leaving digital safety out of curricula. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies struggle with resource constraints, outdated investigation tools, and jurisdictional barriers when crimes cross borders, as they almost always do online.

In 2022, over 2m cases of child sexual abuse material were linked to users in Pakistan through global reporting systems; however, the FIA recorded just 250 cases locally in the same year

To make real progress, Pakistan’s approach must move beyond crisis response and toward prevention, education, and systemic accountability. Policymaking needs to treat online child protection as an economic and governance priority. Safe online environments are critical for the digital economy to sustain public trust. When families fear the internet, participation drops, and the country’s potential digital dividend narrows.
There is an urgent need for a coordinated national digital safety framework that brings together the Pakistan Telecom­munication Authority, Ministry of IT and Telecom, Ministry of Education, and private sector platforms. PTA’s regulatory powers can be expanded to include mandatory child safety audits for tech companies operating in Pakistan. Schools can integrate digital literacy modules into their curricula, teaching technical skills as well as focusing on online ethics, data privacy, and responsible social media use.
Awareness campaigns should be simplified and localised, using relatable examples in Urdu and regional languages. Parents, especially in low-income and rural areas, must be equipped with easy-to-follow guidance on supervising children’s online activities. Collaboration with telecom operators can also help, for instance, by sending periodic safety reminders via SMS or including digital protection leaflets with SIM activations.
Another crucial step is building capacity within law enforcement. FIA’s cybercrime wing has made progress, but the scale of online abuse demands specialised training, forensic technology, and inter-agency coordination. More female officers and child psychologists should be included in investigative teams to handle sensitive cases. Victims and their families often avoid reporting due to fear, shame, or mistrust in the system, an issue that can only be addressed through confidential, victim-centred reporting channels and visible convictions.
Pakistan’s legal framework, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016, does provide for penalties related to online child exploitation. However, implementation remains fragmented. Provincial child protection authorities often lack the digital expertise or budgets to address online crimes. National data collection on child exploitation cases should be made consistent and publicly accessible to inform better policymaking.
The private sector also carries significant responsibility. Digital service providers and social media companies must deploy stronger age-verification systems, content moderation, and AI-based detection of exploitative content. For instance, Meta’s recent launch of “teen accounts” offers an encouraging precedent. The new model creates built-in restrictions on content exposure, interaction requests, and ad targeting for younger users. It signals that safeguarding children online is not just the government’s job but a shared responsibility between platforms, regulators, and society.
Digital safety should not be treated as an afterthought to connectivity. It is a precondition for sustainable growth in Pakistan’s digital economy. As the country moves toward wider 5G rollout, digital payments, and AI integration, the vulnerabilities of children will multiply unless policy acts faster than technology evolves.
Protecting young users will require better laws and a shift in mindset: from reactive policing to proactive care, from blame to awareness, and from fragmented programs to a unified national policy. The internet has become an extension of childhood, a space for learning, play, and connection. But it can only serve that role if it is supported by informed adults who understand the stakes.
The question now is not whether Pakistan can connect its youth to the digital world, but whether it can make that connection safe, equitable, and humane.

Rapid urbanisation, industrial expansion, and indiscriminate tree cutting, particularly in Punjab, are intensifying heatwaves, localised flooding, and soil erosion. The consequences are already evident in cities such as Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala, where disappearing green cover is putting residents at risk and creating cascading impacts on community health, agriculture, and economic resilience.
Pakistan loses approximately 11,000 hectares of forest each year, resulting in forest cover of only around five per cent of the total land area, according to a recent report from the World Wide Fund for Nature Pakistan. Punjab, the most populous and industrially active province, has emerged as a critical hotspot. The rapid development of housing societies, factories, and industrial zones is systematically depleting mature trees and urban green spaces. During my field research with my team in Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala, we observed extensive tree cutting firsthand. Often, this occurred without enforcement, oversight, or accountability, highlighting systemic governance deficiencies.
Other provinces face similar threats. Sindh’s riverine forests are silently disappearing as farmland pushes deeper into once-wooded fields. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, widespread timber and fuelwood extraction continue, often carried out illegally.

Unchecked tree cutting and urban expansion are endangering Pakistan’s climate resilience, causing a ripple effect on health, agriculture, and the economy

As a consequence, communities that once depended on natural vegetation to shield them from floods or keep their lands fertile are now left susceptible to climate disruptions.
Trees are more than scenic elements; they regulate temperatures, retain rainfall, and preserve soil structure. Without them, heat accelerates quickly. During visits to Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala, residents said the ‘air feels heavier’ in summer compared to previous years.
Streets once lined with shade now emit heat well into the night. Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad frequently cross 45°C, straining health systems and forcing residents to spend more on temperature regulation.
This is the urban heat island effect in plain sight: concrete and asphalt lock in warmth while greenery retreats. In new housing societies, where tree planting is barely a priority, the temperature difference from older shaded neighborhoods may be felt quickly. Heavy downpours add another layer. The torrential monsoon in late July and August 2025 turned streets into streams, especially where drains were clogged and open spaces had been paved over.
Forests are not only environmental assets but also everyday resources. In rural Punjab, farmers point to declining canopy cover as one reason soils dry out faster and input costs rise. A farmer in Khanewal explained that without trees “water doesn’t stay long, and every crop now needs more irrigation”. Families who once collected fodder or fuelwood nearby must now spend more time and money to obtain it.
The knock-on effects spill into urban economies as well. Degraded land makes floods more destructive, while disrupted water cycles add to the cost of maintaining infrastructure. Costs of repairing infrastructure after floods, higher electricity bills during prolonged heatwaves, and reduced agricultural productivity all translate into direct financial distress.
Forest laws exist in the country, but effective enforcement remains difficult in practice. In big cities such as Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala, housing colonies and commercial developments often proceed without any monitoring of how many mature trees are cut down. Tree cutting in private plots is rarely checked.
During field visits in agrarian belts such as Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala, the shade of green cover loss was prominent. Large Neem, Peepal, and Sufaida trees, once common in these cities, had been cut down for construction. Residents explained that selling timber and clearing land for housing societies were more profitable in the short run, especially with little enforcement in place. These everyday choices are gradually reshaping the landscape, leaving local climates fragile and soil structures unsuitable for agriculture.
Effective regulatory enforcement should be linked to an institutional accountability system to ensure that land-use decisions undergo stringent environmental scrutiny. Urban planning must incorporate mandatory green zoning and tree retention requirements, obliging developers to integrate ecological safeguards.   Simultaneously, market-based instruments like carbon credits, fiscal incentives, and payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes may encourage communities and the private sector to invest in sustainable forest management.

Party leaders formally filed a representation against the bill, which has been sent to the president, prime minister, Punjab governor, chief minister and other senior officials.
PTI leader Ijaz Shafi said on Sunday the bill would be challenged in the LHC, along with a request for a stay order. He said objections have been prepared with the assistance of lawyers.
The representation has been submitted by Sheikh Imtiaz Mahmood, Ijaz Shafi, Muneer Ahmad and Mian Shabbir Ismail.
According to the text of the representation, several provisions of the bill are in conflict with Articles 17, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution.
PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers.
They said the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.
They demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.
The bill was passed in mid-October.

That is the public posture, as Prime Minister Modi wants to keep his macho image intact. But the reality is not that simple. India today is more than ready to compromise and, courtesy of the behind-the-scenes understanding, the two countries are reportedly close to a trade deal.
President Trump has been urging India to stop or at least reduce importing Russian crude. Increasing tariffs on Indian goods was just one of the levers he has used. Many say that President Trump has successfully used the Pakistan card with India to pressure New Delhi into accepting US demands. His objective is to increase pressure on Moscow and make it compromise towards a negotiated deal on stopping the war in Ukraine.
But to achieve that, President Trump needs India and China to reduce, if not stop, buying crude from Russia. Strangely enough, India remains his major target. When Trump began playing his tariff cards aggressively, he slapped a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods. This was punishment for New Delhi for buying Russian crude.
From the US view, the current situation is unacceptable. Today, Russia is New Delhi’s largest source of oil. India’s imports of Russian oil soared from four million tonnes in FY22 to over 87m tonnes in FY25 — a massive surge by 21 times in a few years.

The US and India skirt around trade deals and tariff talks as the latter continues its reliance on Russian crude

The surge was driven by discounts offered by Russia after Western sanctions, making its crude more attractive to Indian refiners. After FY22, Russian oil averaged a 14.1pc discount in FY23 and 10.4pc in FY24, saving India roughly $5 billion a year or 3–4pc of its crude import bill.
According to Kpler, a shipping analytics company, India imported 4.5m barrels per day (bpd) of crude in September. Of that, Russian supplies accounted for roughly 1.6m bpd — or 34pc of the total.
That represents an eye-watering 2,250pc increase from January 2022, one month before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Ukraine. At the time, India was importing just 68,000 bpd of oil from Russia.
In 2021, Russian crude accounted for just 3pc of imports at Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery, India’s largest private facility. By 2025, that share had surged to around 50pc, data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) underlines.
CREA has also calculated that the Jamnagar refinery of Reliance exported $85.9bn of refined products globally from February 2022 to July 2025. Reliance relied mainly on discounted Russian oil to produce and export these fuel products. Incidentally, an estimated 42pc ($36bn) of that has gone to countries sanctioning Russia. And the US wants all this to stop.
The Indian public posture remains defiant. Speaking at the Berlin Global Dialogue, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal emphasised that India doesn’t sign deals with guns to the head, nor does it decide friends based on considerations other than national interest.
Mr Goyal added that trade deals were long-term agreements based on mutual respect and national interest, and India was in talks with the European Union (EU) and the US, but it did not work under deadlines.
In the meantime, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has claimed India has begun scaling back Russian oil imports. Her comments came during questioning about the fresh set of sanctions Washington had imposed on Russia’s top oil companies — Rosneft and Lukoil. “We know India has done the same at the request of the President,” Ms Leavitt said at a press briefing.
Reliance Industries, India’s largest private oil refiner and one of the biggest buyers of Russian crude since 2022, confirmed that it is adjusting its procurement strategy to comply with recent Western restrictions.
It is now being reported that Reliance Industries has effectively halted purchases of Russian crude, following the new sanctions. In a statement issued by the company on Oct 24, it conceded that it is “evaluating the implications” of the newly announced measures and will “fully comply with EU guidance regarding the export of refined products to Europe”.
Several other Indian refiners have reportedly begun planning a gradual cut in Russian oil purchases, a Reuters report said late in October.
Interestingly, the wedge between Indian public pronouncements and behind-the-scenes promises is getting wider. In mid-October, US President Donald Trump announced that Modi had privately agreed to end those purchases “within a short period of time”.
India, however, immediately contradicted Trump’s statement of a pledge by Modi to reduce crude imports from Russia. Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters the next day that he was unaware of a conversation between Trump and Modi the previous day.
Former US and Indian officials said the split between the two countries’ messages reflects their fragile relationship. Trump, they said, is eager to declare a diplomatic victory and ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Modi does not want to appear to cave in to American coercion.
Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former ambassador to the United Nations described it as “classic pressure politics” from Trump, Megan Messerly of Politico quoted him as saying.
“Delhi’s vague response is deliberate. It’s a reminder that strategic autonomy rather than alignment guides its energy choices,” Mr Akbaruddin insisted. But he interestingly conceded, “India may adjust volumes quietly, but it will not be seen as bowing to US demands. The message is clear: cooperation, yes; coercion no.”
Mark Linscott, a former negotiator for the US Trade Representative’s Office who was involved in negotiations with India during Trump’s first term, described it as a “delicate dance” between “the President’s desire to go public and India’s desire to keep any understanding behind the scenes, as long as they can get the 25pc penalty tariff to go away and pave the way for a trade deal”.
To protect his public image back home, Modi also cancelled his trip to Malaysia to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit — apparently to avoid any public engagement with Trump as per media reports; a purely subcontinental mindset on display.

• Oman urges Tehran and Washington to resume stalled nuclear talks
TEHRAN: Iran said on Sunday that it would rebuild nuclear sites damaged by Israeli and US strikes “stronger than bef­ore”, as mediator Oman urged Tehran and Washi­ngton to revive stalled diplomacy.
US President Donald Trump has said the strikes obliterated Iran’s nuclear programme, but the full extent of the actual damage remains unknown.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a visit to the country’s nuclear organisation, said Tehran “will build (the destroyed sites) stronger than before”.
“By destroying buildings… we will not be set back,” he said in a video posted to his official website, adding that Iranian scientists still had the necessary nuclear know-how.
Pezeshkian did not elaborate. In similar remarks in February before the strikes, he said Tehran would rebuild its sites if they came under attack.
Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran in June, kicking off a 12-day war that saw it target nuclear and military facilities — as well as residential areas — and kill many top scientists.
Iran retaliated with ballistic missile barrages aimed at Israeli cities.
Iranian Foreign Mini­ster Abbas Araghchi said in July, after the United States announced a halt in fighting, that the damage in Iran was “serious and severe”.
Pezeshkian’s comments came as Oman, Iran’s traditional intermediary, urged the two countries on Saturday to resume talks.
“We want to return to the negotiations between Iran [and] the United Sta­tes,” Omani Foreign Mini­ster Badr Albusaidi said at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain.
Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Sunday that Tehran “has received messages” on resuming diplomacy, without providing further details.
Oman hosted five rounds of US-Iran talks this year. Just three days before the sixth round, Israel launched its strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Iran has since faced the return of UN sanctions after Britain, Germany and France triggered the “snapback” mechanism over Tehran’s alleged non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.

According to a police official, Saqib, a team was conducting a search operation in Paracha grav­yard near the Karbogha area when the remote-controlled explosion occur­red, leaving SHO Imran­uddin, Head Constable Jihad Ali and Abid Ali injured.
All three were later provided treatment  Hangu’s district headquarters hospital.
The attack followed a threat alert issued on Fri­day by the federal interior ministry in Islamabad. The alert had cautioned that a  motorcycle lad­en with explosives might be used to strike a police checkpoint or security officials between the Hangu and Orakzai districts.
The alert had urged concerned authorities to heighten security in the area.
IED expert killed
Meanwhile, security forces eliminated Abu Dujana, an Afghan national identified as a specialist bombmaker, during an intelligence-led raid in Tank district’s Lali Khel area.
The operation, which saw two or three militants escape despite sustaining injuries, yielded a significant cache of weaponry including a 30kg IED, which was promptly neutralised, and a suicide vest, grenades, small arms and ammunition, according to sources.
Kalat bridge bomb defused
Separately in Balochistan, locals helped avert potential disaster by alerting authorities to explosives planted beneath a bridge in Kalat district’s Johan area.
Security forces rushed to the site and defused the 10-kilogram device, which a senior levies official described as “locally manufactured” and intended to destroy critical infrastructure in the Johan sub-tehsil.
He added that a further investigation is underway.

They attribute the price swings to a rare mix of global and local factors; fluctuations in international gold prices, escalating armed conflicts that threaten to widen war zones, US tariff pressures under President Trump, dollar volatility, geopolitical tensions, and abrupt shifts in domestic economic policies.
Ultimately, market decisions rest with individual investors, as projections for Pakistan’s gold sector are shaped by traders/experts’ intuition rather than fact-based evidence. Comprehensive data on the country’s gold market remains unavailable, though, various institutions hold partial information on financial transactions and the inward and outward movements of precious metals in this largely self-regulated, informal sector.
Yet none, including the State Bank, the ministries of finance and commerce, or the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, can provide credible, consolidated figures on market size, demand, supply or price trends. Moreover, gold prices for different categories are determined and announced daily by the gold merchant’ bodies, based not on demand and supply.
Gold prices in Pakistan have surged exponentially since the turn of the millennium. In 2001, 10 grams of gold traded for around Rs5,000; today, it exceeds Rs350,000, a staggering 70-fold increase. Returns in other asset classes, however, such as real estate and the stock market, have been even steeper over the same period.

Rising demand trends reflect a gradual shift from ornamental to investment purposes with gold increasingly serving as a hedge against inflation and rupee depreciation

Pakistan’s gold market witnessed sharp volatility last month. The price of 10 grams of gold swung within a wide band of Rs58,900 opening October at Rs343,200, peaking at Rs402,100 on the 17th, and closing the month at a lower Rs361,800.
Regardless of its relative performance against other asset classes, gold remains an indispensable physical asset and a trusted store of value, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Beyond its financial appeal, the precious yellow metal holds deep cultural significance across the region, long cherished in the ornament trade as a symbol of prestige, security and regality.
An economist with close ties to the All Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), commenting on the recent volatility, explained, “Gold is priced by a combination of global bullion dynamics such as US interest-rate movements, central-bank purchases, Exchange-Traded Funds [ETFs] flows and local structural factors such as rupee–dollar parity fluctuations, regulatory disruptions like import bans or standard regulatory order suspensions, smuggling, seasonal consumption spikes during weddings seasons and festivals and shifts in jewellery industry demand patterns.”

Gold-backed ETFs serve as a real-time barometer of global investment demand for the metal. Their performance influences international bullion prices, which in turn feed into Pakistan’s domestic gold rates through the London and Dubai benchmark prices and the prevailing rupee–dollar exchange rate.
“Given the persistence of external risks, including global monetary policy shifts, geopolitical tension, and domestic vulnerabilities such as foreign exchange instability, informal trade, flood-related disruptions, further bouts of volatility are more likely than a sustained calm,” observed a leader of the APGJSA.
Explaining the government’s decision to ban gold import and export in May and lift the restriction in October, an officer said privately that the initial move came after the outbreak of war with India, aimed at curbing the flow of gold and other precious metals to India via Dubai and conserving foreign exchange by limiting luxury spending. The ban was lifted last month following pressure from jewellers and strong investor demand, which had begun driving domestic gold prices higher.
Some analysts note that rising inflation and the tense border security situation have driven people toward gold as a reliable store of value. They argue that the growing preference for physical assets like gold reflects heightened risk citizens now associate with other investment avenues.
In the absence of regularly published official data, reconciling numbers from multiple sources, such as Customs, the State Bank and the Federal Board of Revenue, is challenging, especially given gaps in reporting on recycling, informal and illicit flows, and domestic mines’ outputs. In this context, data from the World Gold Council (WGC), though likely underreported, serves as a useful baseline reference.
According to WGC data, Pakistan’s gold demand has fluctuated between 60 and 90 tonnes in recent years. Demand reportedly peaked during FY17, driven by strong jewellery manufacturing and investment activity, but declined sharply following the pandemic shock.
While investment demand for gold bars and coins has risen relative to jewellery, overall consumption has moderated in the post-pandemic period due to record-high prices, rupee depreciation and import restrictions.
According to the WGC data, jewellery accounts for roughly 24-39pc of Pakistan’s total gold demand, while investment demand has steadily risen from about 11pc in 2010 to nearly 26pc in 2024. Together, these two segments make up around half of total consumption, with the remainder attributed to industrial and other uses. The trend reflects a gradual shift from ornamental to investment purposes, as gold increasingly serves as a hedge against inflation and rupee depreciation.
Members of the government’s economic team were approached for comment. But their responses were still awaited at the time of filing of this report. A spokesperson for the SBP said the queries had been forwarded to the relevant department, though the input had not arrived in time.
Chief Statistician Dr Naeem uz Zafar assured that customs data on gold trade and estimates of household gold holdings from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey would be shared. However, he cautioned that the figures might not be fully reliable, as respondents often underreport their assets. The said data was not timely shared.

• Qaiser says party ‘willing to talk to anyone’ if fair polls assured
• Ismail says no ‘minus-Imran formula’
LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Even as its founder remains locked up, and the party continues to lose ground, some former PTI members seem to have taken it upon themselves to end the isolation faced by their erstwhile party, proposing talks with the government and other parties to bring down political temperatures and pave the way for Imran Khan’s release.
Only a day ago, a number of ex-PTI leaders, including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail, had called on party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, ostensibly to seek his blessing for their campaign — an offer Mr Qureshi did not endorse, as per his lawyer.
On Sunday, Mr Chaudhry doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue.
Speaking to Dawn, Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that he and his colleagues did not have a mandate to engage with the government on behalf of the PTI. However, as a concerned citizen, he said he wanted the volatile political climate to stabilise.
According to the ex-PTI leader, his group will meet the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman next week to ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions.
He claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders.
“If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to people like Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid.
“If the government does not leave any stake for the opposition in the system, the opposition will be left with no option but to hold long marches, resign from assemblies and resort to other modes of protest,” he rued.
It may be noted that the government and opposition held a series of talks in the recent past, which did not prove fruitful.
“Until the three major players —Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – and the establishment engage with the incarcerated seasoned politicians, no political engagement will be possible in a volatile situation,” he added.
Speaking about his “meeting” with Mr Qureshi and Ejaz Chaudhry, he said he planned to take these leaders on board in light of their letters from jail in which they had urged the party chief for dialogue to break the political deadlock. The incarcerated leaders had written a letter to their jailed chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on only talking to the military establishment.
Downplaying overtures
On the other hand, former NA speaker and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser played down the recent overtures by his former party colleagues, saying they would be prepared to talk only if the “stolen mandate” was returned to the “true representatives”.
“The fact is that we have been suggesting for years that the PTI is ready to talk to everyone only if justice is provided to the party without creating any hurdles,” Mr Qaiser told Dawn.
“We just want the court cases to be decided on merit. We are willing to talk with anyone about deciding the modalities of the next election and assurances that the next election will be free and fair,” he said.
When asked if it was correct that some party leaders wanted to “streamline” the issues with the establishment, but were reluctant due to Imran Khan, Mr Qaiser said that some individuals may have their personal opinions, but it was not the party policy. “During party meetings, it is categorically stated that there will not be any compromise on principles,” he said.
However, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI leadership had failed to create any breakthrough to get Imran Khan out of jail during the past two years. He claimed that he had told Mr Khan that many politicians in the party had vested interests attached to his imprisonment and they would make no efforts to help him get out of jail.
No ‘minus formula’
His colleague Imran Ismail dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’ and termed their outreach campaign an “effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation”.
“We privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward,” he said in a lengthy statement posted on X (formerly Twitter).
 






“When we met Chaudhry Ejaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI, both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” he said.
He said if any PTI leader believed that “continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise”.

• Pakistan to demand complete Israeli withdrawal, unfettered provision of aid to Palestinians
ISLAMABAD: Turkiye is expected to push for ensuring the security and administration of Gaza by Palestinians, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar joins his counterparts from the eight-nation Muslim bloc, suing for peace in the besieged Palestinian territory, for a summit in Istanbul today (Monday).
The Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers is expected to take up the Gaza ceasefire deal, piloted by US President Donald Trump.
However, the truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force.
The Istanbul meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with US President Donald Trump on Sept 23, on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
At the foreign ministers’ meeting, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace,” Reuters quoted a Turkish foreign ministry source as saying on Sunday.
The source said Mr Fidan is set to tell the meeting that Israel is “making excuses” to end the ceasefire and emphasise the need for the international community to “take a resolute stance against Israel’s provocative actions”.
He was also set to say that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is insufficient and Israel has not fulfilled its obligations in this regard.
According to TRT World, Mr Fidan is anticipated to stress the need to swiftly implement arrangements that would allow Palestinians to assume responsibility for Gaza’s security and administration, while safeguarding their legitimate rights and upholding the vision of a two-state solution.
He will also highlight the importance of maintaining consultations and close coordination on steps to be taken within UN platforms, the sources added.
Relations between Turkiye and Israel have hit new lows during the Gaza war, with President Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticising Israel’s attacks. It was Turkiye that helped persuade Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan, and Ankara has expressed willingness to take part in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), proposed to monitor ceasefire implementation in Gaza.
However, Israeli has made it clear that it won’t accept the presence of Turkish armed forces in Gaza. Other nations part of troop contribution talks include Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Top-level consultations are said to be underway over the question of sending Pakistani troops for the proposed ISF, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon.
However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the United Nations umbrella.
On Saturday, the Jordanian and German foreign ministers had called for a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”.
Pakistan’s stance
During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, a statement from the Foreign Office said.
 






Pakistan has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh, the FO said.
“Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO added.
Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement said.

• Calls for deeper reforms to cut energy, input costs
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has asked Pakistan to improve its skewed preferential trade agreements with 10 bilateral partners, ensure a market-determined and flexible exchange rate and push deeper reforms to lower energy and other input costs to turbocharge over three decades of declining exports for sustainable economic growth.
In a policy advice to the government, the bank observed that nearly all countries that have achieved rapid and durable growth have done so by tapping into global markets, but Pakistan has struggled to follow this path.
“Exports have declined from 16 per cent of GDP in the 1990s to just around 10pc in 2024, with the export basket still concentrated in low-value textile and agricultural products,” it said, adding that economic upturns had been fuelled instead by debt and remittance-financed consumption, rather than export dynamism.
 
 

The Washington-based lending agency has asked Pakistan to maintain a flexible exchange rate to ensure export competitiveness and complement tariff reform.
“Allow the emergence of a deep and liquid interbank market without SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] intermediation and encourage greater participation from a diverse range of market players, including exporters, importers and foreign investors,” it said.
It also demanded the publication of detailed data on interbank market transactions, including volumes and participants and phase out ad hoc interventions by the central bank, allowing the exchange rate to reflect genuine supply and demand.
It noted that as growth accelerates and is fuelled by higher imports, foreign exchange reserves are strained, particularly when the exchange rate is tightly managed, triggering recurrent balance-of-payment crises. This cycle of boom and bust has undermined investor confidence, constrained private investment and eroded the foundations of long-term sustainable growth.
 
 

Underlying this weak export performance are deep-seated productivity and competitiveness challenges, it said. Distor­tionary policies, such as high tariff barriers, increased input costs and consumer prices, driving up production costs and encouraging firms to focus on protected local markets.
Simultaneously, excessive and redundant red tape and regulation, and a heavy state presence in the economy (including more than 200 state-owned enterprises at the federal level) have undermined efficiency, deterred investment, and distorted resource allocation, as exporters face major constraints on  access to finance.
On top of that, the costs of customs management and logistics are high, and government-supported measures to assist firms in accessing foreign export markets have often been insufficient, including in negotiating trade deals, establishing a system to support
export market compliance, and promoting Pakistan’s exports abroad.
Therefore, fundamental constraints to firm productivity remain unaddressed, including the exorbitant cost of electricity and limited access to core digital infrastructure.
“In combination, these challenges have led to missing exports of close to $60 billion,” the World Bank said and advised a large set of reforms, including deepening preferential free trade agreements for expanding markets.
The bank said free or preferential agreements with other countries serve as a critical lever for strengthening competitiveness and market access by reducing barriers and addressing trade facilitation issues, such as customs procedures, standards and investment integration, thereby creating an enabling environment for exporters to expand and diversify.
But these agreements, in the case of Pakistan, remained underutilised, leading to missed opportunities. “Pakistan remains party to only 10 trade agreements, most of which are shallow and limited to tariff liberalisation on a narrow set of goods,” it said. The China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement covers a larger share of areas, including tariffs, investment and trade facilitation, while agreements with Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the South Asian Free Trade Agreement remain partial in scope,” the bank pointed out. This leaves Pakistan behind its aspirational peers, which leverage a greater number and depth of agreements to embed themselves in global value chains and attract investment. “Deepening existing trade agreements and expanding coverage under those agreements to services, non-tariff measures and investment will be key,” it said.
The World Bank asked the government to enhance the capacity of the negotiation unit through targeted training, ensure regular consultations with exporters and industry to align agreements with business opportunities and establish mechanisms to monitor implementation and performance of trade agreements.
It also suggested active exploration of avenues to upgrade existing shallow preferential trade agreements towards deeper agreements covering services, investment and digital trade, including those with non-traditional export markets in regions with export potential, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.
The bank welcomed recent tariff reforms but said they needed to be complemented by a flexible exchange rate, full operationalisation of the EXIM Bank of Pakistan, stronger trade facilitation and broader structural reforms to boost export competitiveness. The World Bank called for capacity building of the National Tariff Commission to monitor, evaluate and implement anti-dumping and countervailing measures to protect against unfair trade practices and focus on trade negotiation efforts on further tariff reductions with key and emerging trade partners.

• PM reiterates commitment to providing safe environment for newsmen
• PTI sees ‘crackdown’ on media as ‘darkest chapter’ in country’s history                
ISLAMABAD: Amid a surge in crimes against journalists, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has called on the federal and provincial governments to take concrete measures to ensure the safety and security of journalists.
The call came as PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his government’s commitment to protecting press freedom and ensuring a safe environment for journalists.
“There can be no real press freedom without accountability for attacks against members of the media,” PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said in a statement on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists.
They noted with concern that crimes against journalists had witnessed a sharp surge, jumping nearly 60pc over the past year, with 142 cases documented between Nov 2024 and Sept 2025.
This creates “a climate of fear and intimidation that undermines press freedom and the public’s right to information,” the statement said, while demanding that the government ensure the safety and security of journalists; investigate and prosecute crimes against them in a timely manner’, ensure justice and reparations; and, create a safe and enabling environment for the press. 
In his message on #EndIm­punity day, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to all journalists who have endured hardships in the pursuit of truth and justice, and expressed solidarity with the families of those writers, journalists, and media workers who lost their lives in the line of duty.
“We will take all necessary measures to guarantee effective investigation of crimes against jou­­rnalists, deliver justice, and ens­ure legal action against the perpetrators,” he further emphasised.
He said a free, informed, and responsible press is vital to democracy, enabling public access to facts and truth. Acts of violence or threats against journalists, he noted, are attacks on freedom of expression. 
The prime minister also urged the global community, media organisations, and civil society to help protect journalists and uphold press freedom.
‘Attempt to muzzle dissent’
Meanwhile, pointing to recent reports indicating that Punjab and Islamabad had become the most dangerous places for journalists in the country, the opposition PTI described it as a deliberate and systematic campaign to muzzle dissent, criminalise journalism, and suppress the truth.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram warned that the ongoing crackdown on journalists and the press represented “one of the most repressive chapters in Pakistan’s democratic history”.
He said the alarming rise in attacks, arrests, and legal cases against journalists underlined the regime’s growing intolerance for truth. The PTI leader also expressed his anguish over the murder of senior journalist Arshad Sharif, whose killers remain unpunished, despite the lapse of several years.

Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma starred with both bat and ball to propel India to the title in front of a jubilant home crowd at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium.
Hosts India posted 298-7 and then bowled South Africa out for 246 in 45.3 overs with spinner Sharma taking five wickets after earlier contributing a vital run-a-ball 58 in the middle order.
Opener Verma top-scored with 87 as India posted a challenging total after they were put in to bat in a final delayed two hours by rain.
 






South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt hit a valiant 101 but her departure off Sharma raised the noise at the 45,000-capacity stadium, which had turned into a sea of blue.
Sharma took down Nadine de Klerk, for 18, for the final wicket as India celebrated with the thousands of supporters inside the ground and millions outside in the cricket-mad nation.
“We wanted to break this barrier,” Kaur said.
“And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it, now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning.”
 






The Indian women triumphed at the third attempt after finishing runners-up in 2005 and 2017.
India toiled in the league phase and suffered three successive defeats but clinched the last semi-final spot, before knocking out record seven-time champions and heavy favourites Australia.
For South Africa, it was a third straight loss in a World Cup final after they finished runners-up in back-to-back editions of the T20 showpiece in 2023 and 2024.
South Africa made their first ODI World Cup final despite starting the competition with a 10-wicket thrashing by England after being bundled out for 69.
Verma’s golden arm
The Proteas had their revenge when they beat England in the semi-final with Wolvaardt scoring 169.
“I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had,” said Wolvaardt, who led the tournament batting charts with 571 runs at an average of over 71.
“Brilliant cricket throughout but outplayed today (by India). Unfortunate to be on the losing side but we will definitely grow from this.”
Sharma struck key blows with her off-spin in the final, including the wicket of Annerie Dercksen, who hit 35 in a 61-run partnership with Wolvaardt that gave South Africa hope.
But it was Sharma’s double-wicket over to dismiss Wolvaardt and then Chloe Tryon, for nine, that took India to the brink of victory.
 






Kaur’s ploy of giving the ball to Verma, a part-time off-spinner, in the 20th over proved key as the youngster removed Sune Luus.
Verma dislodged Marizanne Kapp in the next over to plunge South Africa into deeper trouble but Wolvaardt kept South Africa in the game until her departure in the 42nd over.
Kaur said the decision to hand Verma, who was named player of the match, the ball proved to be the “turning point” of the game.
Verma, who was brought into the team for the semi-final after fellow opener Pratika Rawal went down injured, gave India a fast start with the bat.
She put on 104 runs with Smriti Mandhana (45) to lay solid foundations at a venue that has produced big runs, including India’s record chase of 339 in the semi-final against Australia.
 






Sharma then added valuable runs with her 18th ODI fifty to crank up the pressure on South Africa despite three wickets for Ayabonga Khaka.
Sharma took a tournament-best 22 wickets, also chipping in with 215 runs as a batter, and was named the best player of the World Cup.</p><small>2025-11-02 21:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02211452a03c8c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952749/onus-on-kabul-to-act-against-terrorists-using-afghan-soil-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Onus on Kabul to act against terrorists using Afghan soil: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday said that with the establishment of a joint monitoring and verification mechanism, the onus would be on Kabul to take action against terrorists using Afghan soil.
A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on October 25, following days of border hostilities, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Oct 29 that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
The talks produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on November 6.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the information minister responded to a question about the monitoring mechanism discussed in Istanbul, stating that a review would be taken of activities during the past few days and modalities on a joint mechanism would be discussed.
“The onus is on the Afghan regime because their soil is being used for terrorism in Pakistan by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan,” he explained. “For Pakistan, this will be an additional forum to provide evidence and the Afghan Taliban regime has to take action. If they do not take action, they will receive punishment.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
When asked if Pakistan would respond to terrorist attacks by striking targets in Afghanistan after the mechanism is in place, Tarar said it would depend on the situation.
“If the situation is very serious and if Pakistan has the right to respond within international law and the UN Charter, then it depends on the situation that arises,” he responded.
“Once the mechanism is established, there is joint verification and evidence is produced, then any party violating the agreement will be punished. But it depends on the situation,” he added. “Now the Afghan Taliban have no room to make excuses like they used to do. Now that third parties are involved, they will have to take action.”
In response to a question about Afghanistan’s offer to hand over terror suspects to Pakistan, Tarar explained that Pakistan’s government had declined the offer and questioned why the Afghan Taliban administration was issuing such statements following the talks.
“The matter is clear: Pakistan has previously demanded that any terrorists who pose a threat to Pakistan be controlled or arrested,” he said. “However, the Afghan side says they are Pakistani nationals and they will be handed over … I believe these new claims are twisting facts. We immediately proposed a handover through a border post; it is a long-standing position.
“I don’t understand why they have to give these statements and complicate the situation.”
Tarar also called the Afghan Taliban government a “fractured regime” which does not have complete control of Afghanistan.
“There are fragments and not every faction is under control. There is unity of thought between the civilian and military leadership [in Pakistan] and they (the Afghan Taliban) should stop levelling allegations at us. This is propaganda, to which we gave a befitting response.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02225229dcfa17e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952753/anp-backed-lawyers-bag-most-seats-in-kp-bar-council-elections-provisional-results' target='_blank'><strong>ANP-backed lawyers bag most seats in KP Bar Council elections: provisional results</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers backed by the Awami National Party (ANP) have won at least 12 of the 28 seats of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, outperforming other groups in polls held across the province on Saturday, according to provisional results.
The unofficial results released on Sunday revealed that three candidates of Malgari Wakilan (MW), which is affiliated with the ANP, two of the PTI’s lawyers wing and an independent candidate were elected on six of the seven seats of Peshawar.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about the results for the seventh seat until the last updates were received.
Those who were declared successful in Peshawar included Khizar Hayat Khazana, Fazal-i-Wahid and Babar Khan Yousafzai of MW, Ali Zaman and Sophia Noreen of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) and an independent candidate, Muhammad Saeed.
As for the winner for the seventh seat, initially Rafiq Mohmand of MW was reported as successful, but later reports also emerged about the victory of a female candidate, Khushnood Zakirullah.
The official result of the elections will be announced on November 4.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, who is also chairman of the KP Bar Council, was the returning officer for the polls.
According to unofficial results for other cities, independent candidate Fida Afridi bagged the bar council seat in Nowshera, Zarbadshah of MW and Asfandyar of Islamic Lawyers Forum won in Mardan and Syed Mubashir Shah of MW emerged victorious in Swabi.
Meanwhile, Said Hakeem of the Peoples Lawyers Forum (PLF) won the joint seat for Buner and Malakand, Inayat Khan of MW won in Swat and Fawad Khan of the Jamiat Lawyers Forum (JLF) won in Shangla.
Mohammad Ali Khan, who is supported by the PML-N, and Shah Faisal, an independent candidate, won bar council seats in Abbottabad.
Waqas Raza of the ILF and Waqarul Mulk of the JLF, who was also supported by ILF, won from Mansehra. Shahid Mahmood, having the support of the ANP, bagged the Haripur seat.
Hashmat Khan of the PLF and Ahmad Ali, who were also supported by ANP, won in Dera Ismail Khan and Farooq Sabir of the ILF emerged victorious in Lakki Marwat.
Ahmad Farooq Khattak of MW won the Karak seat, while Imaad Azam, supported by the ANP, won in Kohat. Shah Hussain of the MW bagged the Bannu seat, Ikram Hussain of the Islamic Lawyers Forum won in Chitral Upper and Lower, while Shah Faisal Yousafzai of the MW won the joint Dir and Bajaur seat.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02223342c9cf961.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952754/kp-govt-to-form-commission-for-probe-into-vandalism-of-radio-pakistan-building-in-peshawar-minister' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt to form commission for probe into vandalism of Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar: minister</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Local government, Elections and Rural Development Meena Khan Afridi on Sunday announced that the provincial government would set up an inquiry commission to probe the vandalism of the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar during the riots on May 9, 2023.
Following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan on May 9, 2023 from the Islamabad High Court’s premises, riots erupted across the country that went on for at least 24 hours. Public properties and military installations were also vadalised during the riots, including the Radio Pakistan building in KP’s provincial capital.
The announcement that the KP government would be forming a commission to probe the vandalism of the building was made by Meena Khan during a press conference alongside Adviser to the KP chief minister Shafiullah Jan in Peshawar today.
“Since it is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in our jurisdiction, our first cabinet will form an inquiry commission to probe what happened at the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar,” Meena Khan said.
“This commission will probe who was behind what happened to [the] Radio Pakistan [building] and the CCTV footage will be analysed. We will see who opened the doors and also why that footage has not emerged yet.”
 






The provincial minister also spoke about a video showing KP CM Sohail Afridi, allegedly outside the Corps Commander House in Lahore during the riots, clarifying that the chief minister was in Peshawar at the time.
He said Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan spoke about the video during a press conference yesterday.
“They claimed he was in front of the building […], but they must understand that Sohail Afridi sahib was in Peshawar at the time,” he stated. “They cannot find any evidence [to back up their allegations] so they are resorting to lying.
“May 9 is a trap to pressure the PTI and Imran Khan. They are using it as an excuse against KP CM Sohail Afridi sahib; we condemn this.”
 


Jan also criticised Wali for showing the video during a press conference in Nowshera a day prior. He claimed the video was “edited”.
Fielding questions, Meena Khan said that the video was recorded during the Zaman Park standoff in March 2023, when police attempted to enter the Lahore compound to arrest the PTI founder.
“The video shown is not from May 9,” he emphasised, adding that the video had been edited and distorted. “The video is on Sohail Afridi sahib’s social media pages; anyone can check and see that the video is from two months before May 9. You can see the use of water cannons against our workers.”
Jan said that the PTI would respond to the “lies” spread by Wali, adding that “anyone who uses a false video will be given a befitting response”.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02232109827ef23.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952755/only-two-weeks-of-water-left-in-tehrans-main-reservoir-official' target='_blank'><strong>Only two weeks of water left in Tehran’s main reservoir: official</strong></a><br><p>Tehran’s main source of drinking water is at risk of running dry within two weeks, state media warned on Sunday, owing to a historic drought.
The Amir Kabir dam, one of five which provide drinking water for the capital, “holds just 14 million cubic metres of water, which is 8 per cent of its capacity,” the director of the capital’s water company, Behzad Parsa, was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency.
At that level, it can only continue to supply Tehran with water “for two weeks”, he said.
The megacity of more than 10 million people is nestled against the southern slopes of the often snow-capped Alborz mountains, which soar as high as 5,600 metres and whose rivers feed multiple reservoirs.
But the country is in the midst of its worst drought in decades. The level of rainfall in Tehran province was “nearly without precedent for a century,” a local official declared last month.
A year ago, the Amir Kabir dam held back 86 million cubic metres of water, Parsa said, but there had been a “100pc drop in precipitation” in the Tehran region.
Parsa did not provide details on the status of the other reservoirs in the system.
According to Iranian media, the population of Tehran consumes around three million cubic metres of water each day.
As a water-saving measure, supplies have reportedly been cut off to several neighbourhoods in recent days, while outages were frequent this summer. In July and August, two public holidays were declared to save water and energy, with power cuts an almost daily occurrence amid a heatwave.
“The water crisis is more serious than what is being discussed today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned at the time.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021901187c4e2b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952746/policy-expert-mosharraf-zaidi-appointed-pm-shehbazs-spokesperson-for-foreign-media' target='_blank'><strong>Policy expert Mosharraf Zaidi appointed PM Shehbaz’s spokesperson for foreign media</strong></a><br><p>Journalist and policy expert Mosharraf Zaidi has been appointed as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, it emerged on Sunday.
The notification, shared by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on X, said that the appointment was made in “supersession of his (PM Shehbaz’s) earlier orders of even number dated [June 4] and Cabinet Division’s Circular No. 3-2/2024-Min-I, dated [June 10]”.
“The prime minister is pleased to appoint Mr Mosharraf Ali Zaidi as Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media, with immediate effect and until further orders,” the notification read. “[The] Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Cabinet Division are requested to take further action accordingly.”
 






In his post, Tarar wrote: “Welcome on board, brother. A great addition to our team. It’s been great working with you these past few months, looking forward to continue this teamwork.”
Speaking to Dawn, Zaidi said the appointment is “a privilege to serve the Pakistani people—the best people on the planet. And at a time of tremendous potential for this country!
“[I] will try my best to keep pace with the work ethic, resolve and intensity of the prime minister in pursuing transformational change for our country,” he added.
Zaidi, who has been serving as the PM’s coordinator on government performance and innovation, graduated from Lahore University of Management Sciences with a BSc (Honours) in Economics and earned a Master of Public Administration in Policy Analysis and Non-Profit Management from Baruch College in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He has also worked as a policy adviser at the foreign ministry from 2011-2013, before serving as the campaign director and CEO at Alif Ailaan from 2013-2018.
Zaidi founded Islamabad-based policy think tank Tabadlab in 2018, where he served as the CEO until June this year, when he worked as a senior fellow until August.

Karachi Grammar School retains the championship title; records are shattered as teammates and mothers cheer on the swimmers till their throats go hoarse; top-level swimmers wow the crowd with speedy races duplicated in international arenas for team Pakistan. The only thing that does change is the sense of camaraderie, sportsmanship and drive the young women have — it only grows stronger every year.
There were, however, a handful of anomalies at the 31st Sindh Women’s Swimming Championship this weekend. A record 377 participants from nearly 20 institutions across Karachi competed at the two-day age-group championship, compared to figures of 250 or less in previous years. For the first time, lengthier and more strenuous races like the 800m freestyle, 400m IM and 200m breaststroke were scratched from the event list due to a lack of participants, according to the organisers.
 
 

For the third straight year, Hareem Malik was crowned double group champion as she bagged the most points in the Under-16 and Open Age categories. The KGS vice-captain took home eight gold medals and set five new records — the most by any swimmer at the meet.
With already one national record to her name, Hareem said her main focus is breaking a couple more when she represents Pakistan for the fifth time at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh next week.
Some of the “older” swimmers like Hareem — those completing their O and A levels — have to balance a robust academic workload with intense training and a packed competition schedule.
The weekend after she returns from Riyadh, Hareem will head to Islamabad for the women’s age group national championships, followed by the National Games in Karachi in December that comes in the thick of mid-term examinations for most school-going athletes.
“I have to allocate time for swimming and my studies, which always comes first, but I do have to compromise at times,” 16-year-old Hareem told Dawn at the Sindh Open.
KGS team captain Haya Bari, who begins university applications in a few weeks, hopes younger swimmers find ways to hold on to their love for swimming while balancing the rigorous demands of elite academia.
Barely 24 hours before the Sindh Open began, Haya’s younger sister Shanzay flew back from the 3rd Asian Youth Games in Bahrain, where she bettered several of her own times.
“It was a great experience and a great platform to represent Pakistan,” said Shanzay, who won six gold, one silver and one bronze medal at the Sindh Open.
“It’s tough having to juggle early morning training, getting home at 9pm, trying to sleep early, and keeping up with your nutrition,” the younger Bari sister said. “Most days you’re eating in the car to save on time.
“But you balance it all by keeping track of time for everything you do, and that’s what this sport teaches us,” she said.
Another standout swimmer this year who tore through the record books was 12-year-old Zoya Omair Hafiz. She retained her U12 group champion title with three golds and as many records, in addition to a handful of silver and bronze medals in both the U12 and open age category. She missed out on the 200m butterfly open age record by just 0.25 seconds.
“I’m happy with my time but if I had gone just a bit faster, I could have broken the record and got my team a few more points,” she said.
“Overall I’m really happy with my performance this weekend. I have junior nationals and then National Games coming up; I’m excited to see how the girls from Punjab and other units perform.”
Several mothers quietly beamed with pride as they watched their daughters give interviews to various tv channels in between taking photos with their teammates and coaches. Just moments earlier, chief guest Nimrah Khan struck a chord with the audience when she spoke about her parents’ unwavering support after meeting with an accident that left her wheelchair bound for over three years.
“Having your parents’ support the way I did is a blessing that so many don’t have,” the actress said in her speech as she choked back tears.
While addressing the parents in the audience, Nimrah asked: “Why are women called the ‘son of the family’ when they achieve something? You need to tell them  you’re proud of them for being their daughter.”
Her parting message to the swimmers was met with roaring applause from an enthralled audience riveted by her journey from athlete to being comatose and now being an actress.
“You all are unstoppable, unreachable, and untouchable. I know there’s several barriers and societal pressures standing in your way, but you’re not answerable to anyone. Keep doing what you do, and you will be unstoppable.”
Overall results: KGS 533 points; CAS 176.5 pts; Karachi Club 129 pts; Haque Academy 110.5 pts; Bayview Academy 109 pts; Beaconhouse Defence Campus 24 pts; Khi United Swim Association and DHA Sports Club (Moin Khan) 2 pts each.

Breakout Democratic Party candidate Mamdani, a naturalised Muslim American who represents Queens in the state legislature, leads former governor and sex assault-accused Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing his party’s primary contest to Mamdani.
The Republican party candidate polling in third place is Curtis Sliwa, 71, who has a colourful past as the founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, a prolific broadcaster and cat lover.
The latest Quinnipiac University poll, conducted from October 23 to 27, gives Mamdani 43 per cent of the vote, followed by Cuomo on 33pc and Sliwa on 14 pc.
The race has centred on the cost of living, crime and how each candidate would handle Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funds from the city.
“Mamdani is an unusual political figure and really captures the spirit of the moment. This is a moment where a loud anti-Trump voice in America’s biggest city is going to get news,” Lincoln Mitchell, a politics professor at Columbia University, told AFP. “Frankly, a Muslim candidate for mayor of New York is an enormous story.”
 
 

Mamdani, 34, has attacked his opponents for Islamophobic rhetoric and smears, calling out both Republicans and Democrats for “anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city”.
New York City Board of Elections data showed 275,006 registered Democrats had cast ballots, as had 46,115 Republicans, along with 42,383 voters unaffiliated with any party in the first five days of early voting, which ends on November 2.
Mamdani’s ascent has highlighted the gulf between the left and centre-right of the Democratic Party. New York’s state governor, centrist Kathy Hochul, appeared at a Mamdani rally on October 26 but was drowned out by “tax the rich” chants, an AFP correspondent saw.
Hochul has been critical of Mamdani’s proposals to impose a 2pc income tax on New Yorkers making more than $1 million.
Mamdani’s rise
Mamdani’s unlikely ascent has been fueled by young New Yorkers canvassing for him, with his campaign claiming 90,000 people have volunteered.
“It really comes back to people speaking to other New Yorkers about the city that we all love,” Mamdani told ‘The Daily Show’.
Teenager Abid Mahdi, a Queens native who leads canvases for Mamdani, told AFP that “when I think of Zohran, I think of what Bernie Sanders was to many Americans in 2016 and 2020. He is my Bernie Sanders in a lot of ways.”
Mamdani appeared with leftist standard-bearer Senator Bernie Sanders at a Queens rally on October 26.
“I’m 15 right now, I’ll be an adult and paying taxes at 18, right? The majority of laws will apply to me in about three years. So, why should I start caring then?” added Mahdi.
Underscoring the importance of older voters who typically turn out in greater numbers than youngsters, Mamdani attended a “paint and pour” session at an elder care home in Brooklyn on Thursday.
Torrential rain at the end of the week slowed canvassing, with the three leading candidates touring TV studios in a final push to woo wavering voters.
Ahead of the vote, Sliwa appeared in a surreal conservative rap video wearing a suit and his signature red beret.
Cuomo, 67, sought on Thursday to court Black and Muslim voters, campaigning in Harlem with current mayor Eric Adams, a corruption-accused Democrat who bowed out, eventually endorsing his former foe Cuomo.
There was a stir in the week when a British newspaper published what claimed to be an interview with former mayor and Mamdani backer Bill de Blasio in which he appeared to question the affordability of the Democratic socialist’s spending plans. The article was removed after the former mayor denied speaking to the journalist.
A day prior, former Democrat president Barack Obama called Mamdani and offered to be a sounding board if the frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign.
The call, first reported by The New York Times, was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson.
“Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city, said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.

The statement issued on Sunday said that the president would attend the Second World Summit for Social Development in Qatari capital Doha from November 4–6, being held under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly.
On the summit’s sidelines, the statement added, the “president will hold important meetings with global and regional leaders, including the leadership of Qatar, as well as heads of major multilateral forums such as the United Nations and other international organisations”.
Meanwhile, the summit “will bring together world leaders and policymakers to discuss ways of advancing social development, promoting decent work and employment opportunities as well as strengthening inclusive safety nets”.
“President Zardari will underscore Pakistan’s commitment to inclusive growth and social protection, with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) at the centre of efforts to reduce poverty and build resilience among vulnerable groups,” the statement said.
It added that “Pakistan’s readiness to pilot a Doha-aligned Social Protection and Jobs Compact (2026–28) aimed at expanding coverage to informal workers, persons with disabilities, and children, while promoting decent work and green employment, will also be highlighted”.
The initiative aligns national plans with the Doha Political Declaration and global commitments on social protection and financing for development, it further stated.
It said the president would underline Pakistan’s intent to work closely with development partners and multilateral institutions to mobilise financing for social protection and green employment through mechanisms such as the Social Development Goals Stimulus, debt-for-social or climate swaps, and South–South cooperation under China’s Global Development Initiative.
President Zardari would also reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to translating the outcomes of the Doha Summit into concrete actions that strengthen social protection systems and support sustainable, inclusive economic growth, the statement added.</p><small>2025-11-02 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02191220a01c67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952747/india-space-agency-launches-its-heaviest-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>India space agency launches its heaviest satellite</strong></a><br><p>India launched its heaviest ever communication satellite on Sunday, the latest step in the country’s ambitious space programme.
The CMS-03 satellite blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh at 5:26 pm local time (1156 GMT).
“Our space sector continues to make us proud!” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wants to send an Indian astronaut to the Moon by 2040.
Weighing about 4,410 kilogrammes, it is “the heaviest communication satellite” launched in the country, the Indian Space Research Organisation said on Thursday.
 






The Indian Navy said the satellite would help “secure communication links between ships, aircraft, submarines”.
The CMS-03 satellite was sent into orbit from the towering 43.5 metre tall LVM3-M5 launch vehicle.
It is an upgraded version of the rocket that launched India’s unmanned craft that landed on the Moon in August 2023.
Only Russia, the United States and China have previously achieved a controlled landing on the lunar surface.
The country has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade, with its space programme growing considerably in size and momentum.

His remarks came on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The day, observed on November 2, highlights the need for justice in cases where journalists are attacked or killed. This year’s observance draws attention to the online threats faced by women journalists and the broader chilling impact these have on freedom of expression.
“Today reminds us that a free, informed, and responsible press is the foundation of any democratic society,” the prime minister said in a statement.
“Journalists enable public access to facts and are torchbearers of truth. Violence, threats, or reprisals against them while performing their duties are attacks on freedom of expression.
“I pay tribute to journalists who faced hardships for truth and solidarity with families of media workers who lost loved ones in the line of duty.”
He added that the Government of Pakistan was committed to protecting press freedom and providing a safe environment for journalists.
“We will take measures to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution of crimes against journalists.
“I appeal to the international community, media organisations, and civil society to play their role in protecting journalists and promoting freedom of expression. A free press guarantees a strong, transparent, and democratic Pakistan.”
Pakistan is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists due to frequent threats, physical attacks, and a pervasive culture of impunity for perpetrators. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Pakistan was ranked 158th out of 180 countries.
A day prior, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemned the worsening situation for media professionals in Pakistan.
A delegation from the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) held talks with IFJ President Dominique Pradalié and Secretary General Anthony Bellanger at the Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) headquarters in Paris, according to a statement issued from Islamabad on Saturday.
“The IFJ leaders expressed deep concern over targeted killings of journalists, misuse of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) to file cases against media workers, undeclared censorship, harassment by state and non-state actors, forced layoffs, and non-payment of salaries,” the statement said.
“They urged Pakistan’s president, prime minister, and top judge to take immediate notice, warning that inaction could prompt an appeal to the United Nations for intervention.”
During the meeting, the PFUJ delegation, including Secretary General Shakeel Ahmed, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Usmani, and Foreign Committee Head Waseem Shahzad Qadri, briefed the IFJ leaders on ground realities.</p><small>2025-11-02 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021130548ba91e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952729/peshawar-ctd-official-dead-2-injured-as-explosives-detonate-at-police-station' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar CTD official dead, 2 injured as explosives detonate at police station</strong></a><br><p>A Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred in Peshawar on Sunday morning, while two others were injured when explosives stored in a police station went off.
Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad confirmed the casualties of the incident at the CTD police station in a statement.
“Preliminary assessment shows that an explosion occurred due to the detonation of old explosive material stored in the police station’s ammunition room. Fire has also spread to other ammunition, causing further explosions,” the statement read.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area, as “clearance [was] going on”, the CCPO said.
He added that the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU), along with rescue and fire brigade services, were working accordingly.
Citing a preliminary assessment, the statement said, “Police sources confirm that this incident does not appear to be a terrorist attack”.
In another statement, the CCPO’s office said a special investigation team of the CTD reached the police station following the incident to collect evidence. It was reviewing the CCTV footage of nearby areas.
Furthermore, statements of the cops present at the police station when the explosion occurred were also being recorded. Besides the investigation team, the CTD and the BDU also collected evidence from the site.
A part of the building, including the basement, collapsed due to the explosion, police said.
KP CM seeks report from IG
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and sought an urgent initial report on it from Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed.
He directed that the cause of the explosion be determined and that safety measures be made more effective, according to a statement from his office.
CM Afridi expressed his condolences over the martyred policeman and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also conveyed his deep sorrow over the explosion and paid tribute to the official’s sacrifice in the line of duty, APP reported.
He also conveyed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel, emphasising the province’s gratitude for the bravery and commitment of law enforcement agencies.
 






IG Hameed has also sought a detailed report from the CTD Additional IG Jawwad Qamar within five days, according to a separate statement by the CCPO.
The cop who lost his life was later identified as Bilal Khan, whose funeral prayers were offered with honours at Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines.
Kundi, IG Hameed, AIG Qamar, CCPO Ahmad, other police officers and security personnel attended the prayers.
Past fire incidents
The stated cause of today’s incident is similar to how the city police station in KP’s Swabi district was destroyed last year.
On Sept 26, 2024, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the city police station in Swabi, resulting in three deaths and injuries to around two dozen people.
The building of the district’s largest and central police station was completely destroyed and still awaited reconstruction a year later.
Officials said that 600 kilogrammes of explosives were kept in the police station, which caught fire, but it was not known as of last month how those explosives caught fire.
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires, as well as periodic industrial infernos.
 
 

In July, four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazaar, rescue officials said.
In October 2024, a blaze at a tissue paper factory in the city’s Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
In June 2024, a fire broke out in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.</p><small>2025-11-02 10:39</small></div><hr>
