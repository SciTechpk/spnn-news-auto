The moves comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott last month designated the CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organisations. Since then, US President Donald Trump has also issued an executive order directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations.
According to Fox News, Florida’s designation of the CAIR is at the state level. It doesn’t carry the legal force of a federal foreign terrorist organisation listing, which only the US State Department can issue.
In a post on X, the Florida governor said, “Florida is designating the Muslim Brotherhood and the CAIR as foreign terrorist organisations.
“Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organisations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” he said in the post, which also shared images of the governor’s executive order.







In response, the CAIR and its Florida chapter announced that a lawsuit would be filed against DeSantis in response to his “defamatory and unconstitutional” order.
“From the moment Ron DeSantis took office as Florida governor, he has prioritized serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida,” the joint statement said.
“Like Greg Abbott in Texas, Ron DeSantis is an Israel-first politician who wants to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims, critical of US support for Israel’s war crimes,” it said.







“We look forward to defeating Governor DeSantis’ latest Israel-first stunt in a court of law, where facts matter and conspiracy theories have no weight. In the meantime, we encourage all Floridians and all Americans to speak up against this latest attempt to shred the Constitution for the benefit of a foreign government,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09131613ac2bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960107/7-injured-as-6-trailer-trucks-collide-on-multan-sukkur-motorway-due-to-fog-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>7 injured as 6 trailer trucks collide on Multan-Sukkur Motorway due to fog: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) on Tuesday, leaving seven people injured, according to Rescue 1122.
A section of the motorway (M5) from Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan to the Multan Sher Shah Interchange — near which the collision took place — was also briefly closed in the morning due to fog hampering visibility.
According to a statement by the Rescue 1122, trucks being driven on the motorway collided with stationary ones due to fog.
Separately, Multan Rescue 1122 spokesperson Arshad Hussain told Dawn that the collision had taken place between six trucks.
The rescue service’s statement further detailed that seven people were injured in the accident, of whom two were taken out of a truck during a rescue operation.
Traffic diverted due to closure
National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) spokesperson Imran Shah earlier confirmed to Dawn that the M5 was closed from the Multan Sher Shah Interchange to Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan between 6am and 11:30am due to foggy conditions.
The M5 is part of the Lahore–Karachi Motorway network and is operational up to Sukkur. Tuesday’s temporary closure forced thousands of travellers to shift to the National Highway to reach their destinations.
Following the closure, traffic was diverted onto the National Highway from Zahir Pir to Uch Sharif, Alipur and Muzaffargarh to access Multan and Rahim Yar Khan.
The disruption inconvenienced commuters travelling to Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad tehsils of Multan district.
Heavy traffic congestion was also reported near several interchanges, including Zahir Pir, Uch Sharif, Jhangra, Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad, after the motorway closure.
In a statement released earlier in the day, the NHMP spokesperson said the decision to close a section of the M5 was taken to ensure the safety of motorists as visibility had dropped significantly along the affected stretch.
The spokesperson said lane violations during fog could lead to serious accidents and urged motorists to strictly adhere to lane discipline.
He advised citizens to travel during the daytime between 10am and 6pm. He also instructed motorists to use fog lights, avoid unnecessary travel, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and refrain from overspeeding.
Weather forecast
Meanwhile, the weather forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department shows fog was expected to blanket multiple areas in Punjab from today until Thursday, including Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. Foggy weather was also expected in Dera Ghazi Khan, Sargodha and Jhelum on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, the weather forecast on the Met Office’s website for the M5 Motorway shows that foggy weather was not expected until at least 11pm.
Fog had disrupted travel in various areas of Punjab in January as well, when authorities had to close sections of motorways due to reduced visibility. Low visibility caused by dense fog had also led to several flights being either delayed, cancelled or diverted at the time and had also affected train traffic.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09125005df87369.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960113/1-injured-after-unknown-assailants-open-fire-on-senator-khurram-zeeshans-in-laws-home-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>1 injured after unknown assailants open fire on Senator Khurram Zeeshan’s in-laws’ home in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>At least one person was injured after unknown assailants opened fire on PTI Senator Khurram Zeeshan’s in-laws’ home located in Hayatabad area on the outskirts of Peshawar during the early hours of Tuesday.
Zeeshan was elected to the Senate in October on a general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz.
According to the incident report filed at the Tatara police station, the attack occurred around 3:15am, with unidentified attackers opening fire on the home located in Phase 2 of Hayatabad.
According to police, Syed Azhar Hussain Bukhari, the senator’s brother-in-law, said he was at his home when it came under attack. He said that one of the people working at his home, identified as Absar Ahmed, had sustained a bullet injury in the attack. He further said that his property was also damaged in the incident.
The spokesperson for the PTI’s KP chapter, Ikram Khatana, also confirmed the attack. He further said that the senator was not present at the residence when it occurred. He said that the attackers had tried to persuade the occupants to open the gate, and upon their refusal, proceeded to open fire.
Senator Zeeshan has not yet responded to requests for a comment.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on social media platform X that he was “ deeply disturbed” to hear about the attack.
While the incident report said that only one person had been injured in the attack, Nasir’s post mentioned two injured.
He said, “The assault on the home of a senator who has been a vocal critic of the power elements underscores the perilous environment for political dissent in the country.
“It is therefore imperative that transparent, thorough investigations be conducted to ensure justice and accountability.”
Senator Nasir further stated that such incidents “erode confidence in the constitutional promise to protect freedom of speech and association, and they must be addressed urgently to safeguard the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their political stance”.







Last month, an alleged quadcopter attack on the residence of PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan in Raghagan area of Khar tehsil had left one of his private guards injured.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091339498497938.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960109/pm-shehbaz-hails-extremely-productive-gratifying-talks-with-indonesian-president' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hails ‘extremely productive, gratifying’ talks with Indonesian president</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday termed his meeting with the Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto “extremely productive and gratifying”, as the two pledged to expand bilateral trade ties.
Addressing a joint press conference with the Indonesian president, he recalled the pair’s meeting and said, “What we have decided is ..to promote our bilateral trade, culture, interact in the medical health, education, and vocational training.”
He vowed to “work closely” with Indonesia to achieve the decided targets.
The premier noted that Pakistan’s current bilateral trade with Indonesia stood at $4.5 billion, out of which more than 90 per cent were palm oil imports.
“We have discussed how to take corrective measures to balance this balance of trade through agricultural exports from Pakistan through IT-led initiatives,” adding that the “trade gap” can be filled in many other areas as well.
President Subianto, who is currently on a two-day official visit to Pakistan, was earlier presented a guard of honour upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s House in Islamabad.
According to Radio Pakistan, a formal welcome ceremony was held for Subianto, who was received by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“A smartly turned out contingent of armed forces presented a guard of honour to the visiting dignitary,” it said.
The Indonesian president arrived in Islamabad yesterday at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In a post on X, the premier had said he was honoured to host President Subianto and looking forward to “our meaningful engagements tomorrow as we work to strengthen this enduring partnership”.







Pakistan and Indonesia will also sign several memoranda of understanding during the visit. Talks are expected to cover advancing bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018. The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
President Prabowo will also meet President Asif Ali Zardari during his stay. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on the Indonesian president, the FO said.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09132732ee95250.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959563/militancy-bangladeshs-militant-pipeline-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>MILITANCY: BANGLADESH’S MILITANT PIPELINE TO PAKISTAN</strong></a><br><p>Faisal Hossain told his family he had found work in Dubai. In reality, the 22-year-old from Madaripur, some 100 kilometres to the south of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, was fighting for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — a banned militant group waging insurgency against the Pakistani state in order to establish their own interpretation of Sharia law.
On September 26, 2025, Pakistani security forces killed Hossain during an operation in Karak district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Arman, identified him from photos of bodies circulated in the media.
Hossain is one of at least four Bangladeshis confirmed killed while fighting for the TTP, referred to as the Fitna al-Khawarij by the Pakistan state. Bangladesh’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit adds that another two dozen or so Bangladeshi nationals are currently in Pakistan, fighting for the TTP and other militant organisations — a trend that experts say first emerged in 2023 and has alarmed authorities in Dhaka.
A second Bangladeshi, Zubair Ahmed, 22, is believed to have been killed in April 2025. “At the end of April, I received a call from an unknown number, informing me that my son is no more,” his mother, Aleya Akter, tells Eos.

Dozens of young Bangladeshi men are said to be fighting for extremist Pakistani outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban. Their recruitment marks a dangerous new export for Bangladesh and a perplexing shift in South Asian militancy…

THE FATE OF RATAN DHALI
The fate of a third man, Ratan Dhali, 29, remains unclear. In early November, the CTTC informed his family he had been killed in the September 26 operation. But on December 1, a video surfaced on Bangladeshi social media, showing someone identified as Dhali and claiming to be alive.
CTTC Superintendent of Police (SP) Rawshan Sadia Afroz tells Eos that officers have investigated the video and found it to be fake and will not be conducting a forensic analysis. A TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, Imran Haider, who initially told Eos that Dhali was dead has now retracted the statement, saying Dhali was only presumed dead because he had been missing.
For Dhali’s family, the uncertainty is agonising. “A few days ago, the police informed me that my son had been killed in Pakistan,” his father Anwar Dhali tells Eos. “Now, God only knows whether my son is alive or not.
Ratan Dhali last spoke to his family on April 11, 2024 — Eid day. He made a video call to his mother, exchanged Eid greetings, and told her he was in Delhi and would soon travel to Dubai. “That was our last conversation. I never spoke to my son again,” says Selina Begum, Ratan’s mother, as she broke down in tears.

RECRUITMENT METHOD
In March 2024, Hossain told his father that he wanted to go to Dubai. But his family did not agree, as they could not afford it. A few days later, Hossain told them that he had found a way to get there. “An elder brother will take me there and pay all the expenses. My salary will be 35,000 takas [$285]. After arriving in Dubai, I will have to repay him from my salary,” he told them.
When Hossain was about to leave home for Dubai, his elder brother Arman asked him if he had obtained a visa. Faisal replied that his visa would be from India. “I was surprised when I heard that,” Arman tells Eos.
“He [Hossain] would call us once or twice a month and say he was working in Dubai,” says Arman. “We last contacted him in June this year. Since then, despite repeated attempts, it has not been possible to reach him.”
Also in March 2024, Dhali told his father he was going to Dubai. “He told me that his boss had a clinic in Dubai and he wanted Ratan to work there,” his father Anwar tells Eos. About 20 days later, was when Dhali called his mother and told her he was in India and would be going to Dubai, he adds.
In reality, both men had travelled to India via the Benapole Land Port — the largest land port in Bangladesh, used for imports and exports to and from India — before staying in Kolkata and Delhi for several days. “Our investigation found that Ratan [Dhali] and Faisal [Hossain] entered India via the Benapole land port on March 27, 2024. From there, they illegally travelled to Pakistan through Afghanistan, where they joined the TTP,” says SP Afroz.
Dhali and Hossain had been working at a clinic called Rof Rof Hijama Centre, located in Dhaka’s Khilgaon area. When Eos went to look for the clinic, it was no longer in the building. A resident said it had relocated a few months earlier.
Zubair took a different route. He first went to Saudi Arabia in November 2024 to perform Umrah. After completing Umrah, he did not return home. The CTTC say Zubair entered Pakistan through legal channels from Saudi Arabia. “After performing Umrah, Zubair said he was not coming home for now, as he was busy spreading the message of Allah,” says Aleya Akter, his mother.

PREYING ON THE VULNERABLE
There seems to be certain similarities in the three recruits: all three come from modest backgrounds.
Dhali studied at a school in Dhaka until class five. His father drives an autorickshaw and his mother is a housewife. Hossain completed his matriculation at a school in Uttara, Dhaka. His father is a retired private-sector employee and his elder brother works as a deliveryman. Ahmed was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Islamic Studies and comes from a middle-class family.
The families of the victims allege that their sons were misled and trapped. They are demanding justice and have urged the Bangladesh government to take immediate action.
“I have only one demand. I want the people who led my son down this path to be punished,” says Ratan’s father. Faisal’s brother Arman echoes the demand. “I request the Bangladeshi government to investigate the root of this cycle and punish those responsible, so that no one else falls for this kind of deception and loses their child in the future,” he tells Eos.
Analysts say militant recruiters often target young people from rural districts, who are seeking jobs abroad or are financially strapped. “People from lower-middle-class families are the most vulnerable, which is why they can be easily persuaded by promises of money,” says Mubashar Hasan, a political analyst specialising in South Asian geopolitics and an adjunct researcher at the Western Sydney University in Australia.
Imran Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan who spoke to Eos via WhatsApp, contends that the young men knew what they were getting into. “No one was brought here by force or deception,” says Haider, who claims to be a former Bangladesh Air Force engineer. According to the CTTC, he left Bangladesh in April 2023.
SCALE OF THE ISSUE
According to SP Afroz, Bangladeshis are joining multiple militant organisations in Pakistan beyond the TTP. “So far, we have identified three of them: TTP, TLP [Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan] and IMP [Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan],” she says.
Experts believe the majority join the TTP, which was founded in 2007 by Baitullah Mehsud. Its current leader is Noor Wali Mehsud, who has publicly pledged allegiance to the Afghan Taliban.
While it remains difficult to estimate how many Bangladeshis are leaving for Pakistan, the trend has grown in recent years. “I am not obligated to tell you how many [Bangladeshis] are fighting for TTP,” says TTP’s Haider.
Bangladeshi police say they have identified dozens who are currently in Pakistan. “We have been able to identify 25 to 30 people who are currently in Pakistan and fighting,” says SP Afroz. Most of this recruitment, experts and security officials add, tends to take place online and often involves misinterpretation of religious edicts.
Dr Tawhidul Haque, a criminologist and associate professor at the University of Dhaka, says the involvement of Bangladeshi youth in militant organisations has been rising in recent years. “And they are now doing these things online, where they face less risk,” he adds.
Hasan Al Mahmud, who has been reporting on militancy in Bangladesh for years, says this trend of people from Bangladesh going to Pakistan to join militant organisations started in 2023. “They are constantly trying to recruit newcomers by misinterpreting religion,” he tells Eos.
Bangladesh police say that they have been cracking down on such activities and are keeping a close watch. “In recent years, we have identified at least a hundred people who were planning to go to Pakistan to engage in militancy,” says SP Afroz. “We stopped them.”

MOTIVATING FACTORS
For experts in Bangladesh, their fellow citizens fighting against a Muslim-majority country like Pakistan represents an unusual development. “In history, people from Bangladesh have gone to fight in many countries for various reasons,” says Mubashar Hasan, the political analyst. “But going to Pakistan to fight against the Pakistani government is a new and surprising development,” he adds.
Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, says these young men are fighting to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan. “Although India and Pakistan were divided in 1947 based on the two-nation theory, Islamic rule was never truly established in Pakistan,” he says. “Our main goal is to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan.”
Mamunul Haque, an Islamic scholar and the joint secretary-general of Hefazat-i-Islam Bangladesh — one of the country’s largest Islamic organisations — rejects this reasoning. He says his organisation strongly advises against leaving Bangladesh to wage an armed war against another Islamic state. “Islam does not support this either,” he tells Eos.
But religious condemnation alone may not deter recruits who have already been radicalised — both online and offline. Dr Haque, the criminologist, says radicalised individuals lose their capacity for critical thinking. “They can’t think about things logically,” he says. “They simply follow whatever instructions they’re given.”
MILITANCY IN BANGLADESH
While Bangladesh has largely suppressed domestic militant activity in recent years, the emergence of citizens fighting abroad suggests extremist networks have adapted — recruiting online and sending fighters to foreign conflicts.
On July 5, 2025, an officer from the Intelligence Branch of Bangladesh’s Anti-Terrorism Unit filed a case with Savar police station in Dhaka, naming six people and their unidentified associates, confirms Savar police station’s officer-in-charge, Mohammad Jewel Mia. “The case, filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, accuses them of conspiring against another country by attempting to disrupt and destabilise its public security on behalf of the TTP, as well as sharing extremist content,” Mia tells Eos.
Law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh also arrested two people on charges of being involved with the TTP, also in July this year. The case file states that some Bangladeshi youths, inspired by the ideology of the TTP, are attempting to establish an Islamic Sharia-based regime in Pakistan by travelling to Afghanistan.
However, local acts of terrorism are few and far between. The last major terrorist attack on Bangladeshi soil took place on the night of July 1, 2016, when five young Bangladeshis carried out a brutal attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, killing 20 people — including 17 foreigners — by shooting and stabbing them. Two police officers were also killed while trying to stop the attackers.
That night, the international extremist organisation Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and released photos of the perpetrators. However, the government rejected the IS claim, attributing the attack to the Bangladeshi militant group Neo-Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh.
In response to such attacks over the years, the Bangladeshi government has banned nine militant organisations in the country as terrorist groups. Under the prevailing laws, these groups are prohibited from carrying out any activities in Bangladesh.
Yet some banned groups have tried to resurface, including Hizb-ut-Tahrir Bangladesh, which was proscribed in 2009. In March 2024, hundreds of members of the group held a public procession following Friday prayers in Dhaka, demanding the country’s secular democracy be replaced by an Islamic caliphate. Law enforcement responded by firing tear gas and sound grenades and arrested several participants.
Meanwhile, even if the video claiming to show Ratan Dhali to be alive isn’t forensically analysed, his family remains trapped between hope and grief — unsure whether their son will return or if he has already become another casualty in a conflict most Bangladeshis barely understand.
It’s an uncertainty that may define this new phase of militancy: families left in limbo, young men vanishing across borders and a threat that operates in digital shadows, far beyond the reach of domestic law enforcement.

According to a press release issued by TI, the National Corruption Perception Survey aims to gauge the perception of the public on important governance issues.
This year’s survey showed that 24 per cent of 4,000 people (1,000 from each province) surveyed believed police to be the most corrupt sector, with the highest level of perception of corruption in Punjab at 34pc, followed by 22pc in Balochistan, 21pc in Sindh, and 20pc in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The department has consistently ranked the most corrupt in previous surveys conducted by TI.

However, the findings of the latest survey noted that there was, at the same time, a “notable” improvement in public perception of the police, compared to 2023.
Closely followed by police was the tender and procurement sector with 16pc of the respondents perceiving it as a corrupt sector. The highest level perception of corruption was among the respondents in Balochistan at 23pc, followed by 18pc in KP, 14pc in Sindh and 9pc in Punjab.
The judiciary was perceived to be third-most corrupt sector by 14pc of the respondents, with the highest level in KP at 18pc.
Bribery encounters
According to the press release, a majority of the citizens, around 66pc, said they did not feel compelled to bribe a public sector official in 2025.
However, the survey also showed that around 77pc of the respondents expressed “low satisfaction” with the government’s anti-corruption efforts.
The highest number of bribes in connection with access to public services was recorded in Sindh, with 46pc of the respondents feeling forced to offer a bribe. The numbers stood at 39pc in Punjab and 20pc in KP.
Further, 59pc of the respondents believed the provincial governments were more corrupt compared to local governments.
“This view is shared in Punjab by (70pc), Balochistan (58pc), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (55pc) and Sindh (54pc),” the report said.

‘Lack of accountability’ major cause for corruption
The findings also showed that a lack of accountability, transparency and limited access to information, and delays in disposing of corruption cases were “major causes” for corruption in the country.


Screengrab from the Transparency International 2025 National Corruption Perception Survey shows results of response to a question on corruption.

“An overwhelming 78pc of respondents nationwide believe that there should be accountability of anti-corruption bodies such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), reflecting a strong public desire for greater oversight and integrity within these institutions,” the press release said.
Respondents cited the following as the top reasons for demanding accountability mechanisms: a lack of transparency in investigations by anti-corruption bodies (35pc), absence of independent oversight of anti-corruption bodies (33pc), and misuse of anti-corruption bodies’ powers for political victimisation (32pc).
The survey outlined three key measures suggested by respondents to curb corruption within the country. At least 26pc of the respondents believed that enhancing accountability was the way forward, while another 23pc advocated for “limiting discretionary powers” and another 20pc for “strengthening right to information laws”.
Around 33pc of the respondents also believed that provincial Anti-Corruption Establishments (ACEs) “were ‘not effective’ in combating corruption at the provincial level,” mostly in Sindh and Punjab, while another 34pc termed it “less effective,” particularly in KP and Balochistan.
The report further added that around 77pc of respondents “are not satisfied with the government’s efforts ot combat corruption,” with 80pc in Balochistan, 78pc in Punjab, and 75pc each in KP and Sindh.
Almost half of the respondents (42pc) shared that “they would feel safe reporting corruption if strong whistleblower protection laws were in place,” while 70pc of them were unaware of corruption reporting mechanisms.
“Among the respondents who are aware [of] corruption reporting channels (30pc), only 43pc have ever reported corruption or unethical practice,” the press release said.
“The findings are consistent across all provinces; Balochistan (76pc), KP (73pc), Sindh (68pc) and Punjab (64pc) respondents feel they are unaware about corruption reporting channels,” it added.
The respondents also believed that the “two key factors motivating citizens to report corruption are anonymity mechanisms in the reporting channels (38pc) and rewards for reporting corruption (37pc).”
Corruption within health sector
The survey also highlighted corruption in the health sector, where a majority of people (67pc) were of the view that corrupt and unethical practices had a “high impact on people’s lives”.
The survey showed that the perception was highest in Sindh at 69pc, followed closely by KP in 68pc, Balochistan at 67pc, and Punjab at 63 pc.
The respondents identified hospitals, doctors and pharmaceuticals as the “main sites of corruption” in the sector.
They also called for “stricter policies against pharmaceutical companies’ commission to doctors”, and “ban on private practice” as effective measures against corruption in the sector.
The respondents also called for stronger regulatory mechanisms in the health sector.
As per the survey, 51pc of the respondents also believed that “NGOs, hospitals, trusts, medical testing laboratories, educational institutions and other charitable organisations receiving tax exemptions from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) should not charge any fees from the public.”
“Majority of respondents nationally (53pc) believe that tax-exempted charitable institutions should publicly disclose the names of their donors and donation amounts on their website,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0910341469fffc1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960106/rsf-says-israel-killed-highest-number-of-journalists-again-this-year' target='_blank'><strong>RSF says Israel killed highest number of journalists again this year</strong></a><br><p>Reporters Without Borders said on Tuesday that Israel was responsible for nearly half of all journalists killed this year worldwide, with 29 Palestinian reporters slain by its forces in Gaza.
In its annual report, the Paris-based media freedom group said the total number of journalists killed reached 67 globally this year, slightly up from the 66 killed in 2024.
Israeli forces accounted for 43 per cent of the total, making them “the worst enemy of journalists”, RSF said in its report, which documented deaths over 12 months from December 2024.
The most deadly single attack was a so-called “double-tap” strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press.
In total, since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023, nearly 220 journalists have died, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.
Foreign reporters are still unable to travel to Gaza — unless they are in tightly controlled tours organised by the Israeli military — despite calls from media groups and press freedom organisations for access.

 

Elsewhere in the RSF annual report, the group said that 2025 was the deadliest year in Mexico in at least three years, with nine journalists killed there, despite pledges from left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum to help protect them.
War-wracked Ukraine (three journalists killed) and Sudan (four journalists killed) are the other most dangerous countries for reporters in the world, according to RSF.
The overall number of deaths last year is far down from the peak of 142 journalists killed in 2012, linked largely to the Syrian civil war, and is below the average since 2003 of around 80 killed per year.
The RSF annual report also counts the number of journalists imprisoned worldwide for their work, with 121 in China, 48 in Russia and 47 in Myanmar.
As of December 1, 2025, 503 journalists were detained in 47 countries across the world, the report said.</p><small>2025-12-09 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09085219ed3d70c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960081/pm-okays-power-projects-for-gb-and-gwadar' target='_blank'><strong>PM okays power projects for GB and Gwadar</strong></a><br><p>• Says transparent, timely completion of uplift schemes govt’s top priority• Directs ministry to prepare roadmap for investment in health sector
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday appro­ved electricity projects for Gilgit-Baltistan and Gwadar, including a 100 MW solar project in GB to en­sure interrupted, affordable and sus­­tainable power supply to the area.
Presiding over a meeting on power sector initiatives in Gwadar and Gigilt-Baltistan, the prime minister approved immediate implementation of a comprehensive plan to resolve issues in the power supply to Gwadar Port City.
All relevant institutions should work in complete coordination to ensure uninterrupted, affordable and reliable power supply to Gwadar Port City, the prime minister directed.
Issuing special directions for the immediate initiation of the 100-megawatt solar project in GB, PM Shehbaz also directed that the project must ensure uninterrupted and sustainable provision of clean and environmentally friendly electricity.
“The welfare and economic dev­elopment of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is among the top priorities of the federal government,” he said, adding that every possible measure was being taken to promote industrial activity, investment and economic growth in GB.
“Uninterrupted electricity supply in Gwadar will certainly enha­nce national economic activity and investment,” the prime minister said. He said electricity supply for industries and investors in the country should meet regional and international standards.
Briefing the meeting, Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said that due to the ministry’s prompt actions, power supply disruptions in Gwadar had already been reduced by 42 per cent.
After resolving outages, a comprehensive plan has also been prepared to stabilise the voltage of supplied electricity in Gwadar within the next six months, the minister said, adding that effective and productive steps were being taken to ensure electricity supply to domestic and commercial consumers in Gwadar.
Among short-term projects, 9.7 megawatts of solar capacity will be installed in major government institutions within the next 8 to 12 months, while in the long-term projects for Gwadar, a 40-megawatt project will be installed to ensure sustainable power supply.
The meeting was informed that due to ongoing industrial and economic development, expansion of Gwadar Port, and growth in urban areas, electricity demand in Gwadar was expected to increase by 30 per cent in the coming years. The 100-megawatt solar project in Gilgit-Baltistan consists of two components: an 18-megawatt rooftop solar programme and an 82-megawatt utility scale solar project.
The rooftop and utility scale solar projects in Gilgit-Baltistan will be completed by 2027 and joint projects between the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of Energy will save the government Rs1 billion annually, the meeting was told.
The meeting was further informed that the GB government would ensure timely provision of land, communications, infrastructure, and other facilities for electricity projects.
Development projects
Presiding over another meeting later, Prime Minister Shehbaz underscored that transparent and timely completion of nationally important development projects remains the government’s top priority.
He directed officials concerned to devise an across-the-board refo­­rm strategy covering all stages of development projects, from appro­val and planning to procurement and human resource deployment.
PM Shehbaz said he would personally chair a steering committee comprising federal and provincial stakeholders to oversee reforms in the development planning and execution framework.
He thanked development partners, particularly the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for their support and technical assistance in advancing reforms aimed at ensuring the timely completion of projects critical to national development.
Meeting with US doctors
PM Shehbaz also met a delegation of Pakistani-origin doctors residing in the US and instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prepare and present a workable roadmap for investment in the country’s health sector in consultation with doctors. He asked for resolving all issues related to investment in Pakistan’s medical sector by Pakistani physicians living in the United States.
The delegation, led by Dr Samir Shafi, comprised Dr Jawad Shah, Dr Tajammul Hussain, Dr Nauman Haider, and Rana Zahid Amir.

Projections by the Fund, which late on Monday approved a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that Pakistan’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026, a pace that barely matches population growth in the country of 240.5 million people.
With a per capita income of $1,677, this trajectory points more to economic containment than recovery.
Pakistan’s population also continues to grow at a high pace, with mid-2025 official figures citing 2.55pc, while World Bank data points to 1.8–1.9pc. Though slightly lower than past peaks, the rate remains a significant development challenge.

 

Pakistan, however, appears to have made the most striking turnaround in inflation. After averaging 23.4pc in FY2024, consumer prices are estimated to have fallen sharply to 4.5pc in FY2025, and projected to rise to 6.3pc in FY2026.
End-period inflation is also projected to ease from 12.6pc in FY2024 to 3.2pc in FY2025, before climbing to 8.9pc in FY2026. The disinflation reflects tight monetary policy, lower subsidies and compressed demand under the IMF programme, though the projected rebound suggests price stability remains fragile.
Labour market conditions offer limited comfort. Unemployment is projected to fall only modestly from 8.3pc in FY2024 to 7.5pc in FY2026, underscoring the weak job-creating capacity of the current growth path.
On the fiscal front, the adjustment underway is substantial. Government revenue and grants are projected to rise from 12.7pc of the gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024 to 16.3pc by FY2026, while expenditure is expected to remain near 20pc of GDP.
As a result, the budget deficit is projected to narrow from -6.8pc to -4.0pc of the GDP. Pakistan is also projected to maintain a primary surplus rising to 2.5pc of the GDP, a central IMF benchmark.
Despite this tightening, the public debt burden remains heavy. Total general government debt, including IMF obligations, is projected to hover around 72–73pc of the GDP, while government and guaranteed debt is expected to stay near 76pc.
Domestic debt accounts for nearly half of the GDP, keeping interest costs elevated amid high domestic borrowing rates.
External pressures have eased but vulnerabilities persist. The current account balance is projected to remain close to zero, shifting from a 0.6pc of GDP deficit in FY2024 to a 0.5pc surplus in FY2025, before slipping back into a small deficit in FY2026. Foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise from $9.4bn in FY2024 to $17.8bn by FY2026, lifting import cover from 1.6 months to 2.7 months — an improvement, but still short of comfortable levels.
Foreign investment, however, remains subdued. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected at just 0.5–0.6pc of the GDP throughout the period under review, pointing to persistent investor caution despite improved macro stability.
Monetary conditions also remain tight. Broad money growth is projected in the 14–16pc range, while private sector credit growth, though improving from 6pc to 15pc, remains constrained by high interest rates. The six-month treasury bill rate stood at 21.5pc in FY2024, reflecting the heavy cost of domestic borrowing.
Meanwhile, the 15.4pc real effective appreciation of the rupee in FY2024 signals a shift towards currency stability after a period of sharp depreciation, though it also carries risks for export competitiveness in an economy where textiles, valued at $17.3bn, remain the dominant export.
Taken together, the IMF projections depict an economy that has regained short-term stability through sharp fiscal and monetary adjustment, but remains burdened by high debt, weak investment and slow employment growth.
The immediate crisis may have passed, but the challenge of translating stabilisation into sustained, inclusive growth remains unresolved.
‘Stability achieved, more efforts needed for growth’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the latest IMF disbursement a “proof that Pakistan is making progress in implementing the necessary steps for economic stability and growth”, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.  
A statement carried by Radio Pakistan further quoted the premier as saying that “the IMF’s expression of satisfaction with the effective implementation of economic reforms and measures in Pakistan is a clear testament to the hard work of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team”.
The statement added that the PM also acknowledged that Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir “played a key role in supporting the implementation of the reform agenda and paving the way for Pakistan’s economic development”.  
He said that steering the country from the brink of default toward stability and growth was a “challenging phase, requiring collective sacrifice from everyone”.
“Political parties sacrificed politics, and the nation endured economic hardships to make the impossible possible,” he was quoted as saying.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction that Pakistan’s economic reforms and digitisation [process] had “become a successful case study and an example for the world”, the statement said, adding that the premier also expressed the confidence that the “dream of Pakistan’s economic development will soon be realised”.
He said that while “stability had been achieved, more efforts are needed to move the economy toward growth”.
The PM expressed his “firm commitment to working diligently for the prosperity of the people and completely freeing the country from foreign debt. He is confident that time is not far when Pakistan will achieve economic self-sufficiency after getting rid of debt”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09101706ad52943.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960104/thailand-cambodia-fighting-spreads-along-contested-border' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand-Cambodia fighting spreads along contested border</strong></a><br><p>Thailand said it was taking action to expel Cambodian forces from its territory on Tuesday, as renewed fighting between the two Southeast Asian neighbours spread along the disputed border.
Each side has blamed the other for the clashes, which have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July.
Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six. One Thai soldier has died in the fighting.

 

In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai Navy said Cambodian forces had been detected inside Thai territory in the coastal province of Trat and military operations were launched to expel them, without providing further details.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said late on Monday that Thailand “must not use military force to attack civilian villages under the pretext of reclaiming its sovereignty”.
Earlier, Cambodia said it had not retaliated even after its forces came under sustained attack.
The Thai Navy said Cambodian forces were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, improving fortified positions and digging trenches, adding it saw the actions “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”.
Monday’s clashes were the fiercest since a five-day exchange of rockets and heavy artillery in July, when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire.
Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured.
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011.
Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.</p><small>2025-12-09 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09095000b43a214.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959989/ibcc-decides-to-remove-bar-of-arts-science-for-admissions-at-inter-level' target='_blank'><strong>IBCC decides to remove bar of arts, science for admissions at Inter level</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a major policy change, the educational boards and curriculum councils have decided to remove the bar of arts and science for students wishing to take admission in any group at the intermediate level.
Now students with arts background at the matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical, pre-engineering and in ICS etc. The decision was made by the Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) at its 183rd meeting held in Karachi a few days ago, sources told Dawn.
The forum made another major policy decisions for O/A level students. Students who passed two major subjects in O/A level will be given equivalence in science group instead of humanities. The meeting also discussed abolishing the science and arts groups at the matric level by replacing it with standards Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible choice of elective subjects. However, a final decision on abolishing groups at the matric level was not made as this will be further debated later.
The sources in Karachi said the forum was of the view that due to the bar at the matric level many brilliant students could not get admission in accordance with their choice at the inter level.

Under new policy, students with arts background at matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical and pre-engineering

When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah confirmed the two major decisions.
“Yes, IBCC forum has decided to give open choice to students for getting admission in first year in their favouirte groups. Similarly, the forum also decided that students of O/A level, who passed two major science subjects, should also be given equivalence in the Science Group,” he said and added that discussion also took place regarding replacing science and arts groups at the martic level with a standardised SSC certificate under which all students, besides compulsory subjects, will have flexible choice of elective subjects.
Dr Mallah while presenting rational behind these decisions said that due to some illogical bars, the growth of many shining students was halted.
“For example, in any school of far flung area of the country, students due to some reasons including shortage of science teachers could not study science, so as per pervious practice, they had no choice to get admission in engineering, medical and computer fields, which was a big injustice with them,” he said and added that now all fields are open for everyone and if students have the potential, capability and talent, they can pass pre-engineering and pre-medical at the inter level without studying these subjects at the metric level.
“Now world is changing and there is need of making changes to help students growth,” he said.
“Let me appreciate all members of IBCC and curriculum councils, who with collective wisdom made these students centric decisions,” Dr Mallah said.
Asked when these decisions will be implemented, he said at the IBCC level, “From today [Monday] we started issuing equivalence in science group to all those students who passed two majors science subjects in their O/A levels exams. Just a moment ago, we issued first equivalence certificate to a student who had passed physics and match in their O/A level.” He added that earlier such students were granted equivalence in humanities groups for not studying one more subject in science. “But, there was no encouragement for them for studying two science subjects,” he said.
“As far as admission in first year with open choice is concerned, I guess, this will be started from upcoming admission session. A decision had already been made and soon we will write a letter to all colleges, universities and boards for implementation,” he said.

After the joint parliamentary party meeting held in the federal capital, the PTI leaders discussed the recent political developments concerning the former ruling party and the ban on meetings with Imran.
The meeting was attended by PTI lawmakers from both houses of parliament, including party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar, Ali Muhammad Khan and MNA Shahid Kattak.
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is the PTI nominee for the National Assembly opposition leader slot, also participated.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar told Dawn that the meeting discussed the current political situation and recent developments, including the unannounced ban on meetings with Imran.
He said the participants of the meeting were of the opinion that Imran Khan was not a security risk, as claimed by the government and the army spokesperson.
“Khan sahab is essential for Pakistan’s stability, democracy, and future. His continued exclusion only weakens the political system and deepens national uncertainty,” he said, adding that the opposition lawmakers were united and resolute on this issue.
“We will use every constitutional, legal and parliamentary forum to secure the release of our leader. The entire parliamentary party stands firmly behind Imran Khan,” he said.
According to Barrister Zafar, the participants of the meeting demanded that they must be allowed unrestricted access to meet the party founder in jail. They were of the view that denying elected representatives and their right to meet their leader was unconstitutional, undemocratic and unacceptable.
“The solitary confinement and isolation of Bushra Bibi is a grave injustice. Subjecting a woman who has no political role to mental torture violates fundamental human rights and goes against our cultural and moral values. Such treatment is unprecedented and deeply disturbing,” he said while sharing the details of the meeting.
Barrister Zafar added that the PTI parliamentary party will remain the strongest pillar of the ongoing movement.
“The party will continue leading the democratic and constitutional struggle for justice, political freedom, and the restoration of the people’s mandate,” he said.
It may be noted that political tensions have been increasing across the country, especially after the press conference of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who claimed that Imran was promoting a narrative against the armed forces.
He also used disparaging remarks against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, prompting the PTI to seek an apology from the army spokesperson.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran Khan.
Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock.</p><small>2025-12-09 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69375c9908b30.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960049/rahuls-cinderella-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>Rahul’s Cinderella challenge</strong></a><br><p>SO, Rahul Gandhi was not invited to the state banquet for Russian President Vladimir Putin. We are told Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ensured that the leader of opposition in parliament’s Lower House — the shadow prime minister in the British system — wasn’t allowed to make even a courtesy call on the visiting dignitary. Rahul took his exclusion demurely, calling it a reflection of the government’s insecurity. He didn’t seem too bothered. When he travels abroad, he said, he finds it difficult to meet senior leaders because they had been advised to not interact with him.
Modi’s peevishness with the Gandhi family is well recorded, but there is evidently more to it than the challenge of competing with Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy and the palpable inferiority complex the combat engenders.
His spite for Rahul can be linked to 2005 when Modi was denied visas by the US and European countries. The Congress government headed by Manmohan Singh had taken over the previous year from a BJP-led coalition of prime minister A.B. Vajpayee. Modi’s tourist visa to the US was revoked during Congress rule. The American embassy cited his alleged role in the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat when he was chief minister of the state.
Did PM Singh indeed have a role in instigating foreign embassies to stall Modi’s travels abroad? If so, it was a foolish and counterproductive idea. If there was indeed a case against Modi, and Zakia Jaffri swears there were several, then the Indian state should not have taken refuge behind foreign governments. If the Congress didn’t have the courage to impound his passport or send him to jail — assuming it had clinching evidence of Modi’s role in the 2002 carnage — it showed cowardice bordering on complicity.

 

Modi hasn’t a care for diplomatic finesse. When two women journalists were assigned to interview Putin at the Kremlin before his Delhi visit, they came across as Modi’s envoys. Which Indian prime minister in Putin’s view had contributed the most to cement India’s ties with Russia? The host wasted no time in ticking off the journalists for asking an “indecent” question.

Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics.

The visit was said to be essentially about optics for both sides. However, the aspect made public was gross. Struggling to cope with Delhi’s acrid air, Putin walked bravely on a red carpet that seemed to have been rented from the lowest (or highest) bidder. As for the comparison of himself with Nehru Modi never stops making, one needs to regard a slice of history.
For contrast, consider Indira Gandhi’s class. Minutes before the Non-Aligned Movement’s summit was to begin at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan in March 1983, Mrs Gandhi walked over to the packed press enclosure. It was a complex international event delicately involving 100 countries. Ziaul Haq and Fidel Castro came calling for opposing ideological corners.
Mrs Gandhi didn’t breeze into the press enclosure to take advantage of the presence of global media. She headed straight to the cafeteria, instead, to ensure her fabled housekeeping rules. “Soggy sandwiches,” she declaimed, ordering frantic officials to remove the trays and get a fresh lot quickly. She then walked back briskly to the summit to take the gavel from Castro.
Regardless of the spite rivals like Z.A. Bhutto, Richard Nixon or George Fernandes reserved for her, Indira Gandhi was an authentic world leader accustomed to the grace and competence required of an Indian PM. She could regale Queen Elizabeth with colonial history in Goa or reward Ronald Reagan for his warm reception at the White House with an adroit but cheerful thank you address. She didn’t position Indian photographers to impress the world when Leonid Brezhnev broke protocol to receive her at the head of an entire Soviet politburo when she landed in Moscow, defying bilious Western reproach. In 1972, Mrs Gandhi chose to overlook the slurs Bhutto had hurled at her in an interview with Oriana Fallaci and concluded that signing the Shimla Accord was more important than getting even.
Indira could speak better French than her father but lacked the intellectual heft of Nehru. But practically all of Modi’s predecessors were better educated than him. And Nehru, his bugbear, wrote brilliant books on Indian and global history, that too during his days in colonial prisons. As prime minister, Nehru negotiated a perilously polarised world and displayed great sagacity at a dire moment in history. Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy were close to destroying the planet before they struck up an enviable friendship. And they both courted Nehru equally. Khrushchev sought his friendship when they visited each other in 1955. Kennedy made a display of his respect for Nehru by climbing the plane’s ladder to welcome the visitor to the US. It was for his widely acknowledged political integrity that Moscow, Washington and Beijing agreed to India’s intervention in the Korean War to negotiate a tricky moment in ending the bloody conflict. Putin knows this even if Indian journalists don’t.
Next, Rajiv Gandhi who was happily married to Italian-born Sonia Maino and enjoying being the father of their two children. He shunned limelight and was pleased with his lack of ambition or pugnacity of his younger brother. If anything, he was content to be a skilled commercial pilot. After Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash and his mother was assassinated in a hail of bullets, Sonia urged her husband not to walk into the dangerous power vacuum. She was right. He was assassinated after a tormented tenure despite an unparalleled 414 seats in the 543-member House.
Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics. When a peeved Modi excluded him from a state banquet, he signalled Rahul’s larger challenge. Unlike Cinderella’s struggle with those who envied her presence at the royal ball, Rahul knows well that there are no fairy godmothers in cutthroat politics to bail him out.

The decision came in a move triggered by a public outrage after a three-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered nullah near NIPA.
“And this is in addition to the manhole covers placed by the KWSC (Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation) and the streetlights fixed by the KMC,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn, clarifying that the city administration is not abdicating its responsibility for covering manholes and fixing streetlights, but is instead giving some financial powers to the UCs to help keep them maintained.
The announcement came directly from Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who said that the new mechanism had been designed to give fiscal space to the union committees, which are currently receiving Rs1.2 million each per month, an amount recently enhanced from half a million rupees.
Under the new summary approved by Mayor Wahab on Monday, each of the 246 UCs across the city would receive additional Rs100,000 every month to maintain the manhole covers and streetlights in their neighbourhoods.

Mayor Wahab says KMC is financially empowering UCs for infrastructure upkeep

Although the manhole covers are provided by both the KWSC and the KMC, he said, it was deemed necessary to take an additional step. Therefore, the KMC has decided to provide additional money to every UC, specifically and exclusively for streetlight maintenance and manhole cover requirements, he added.
An official told this reporter that according to the newly-passed summary by the mayor, the KMC would disburse Rs24.60 million every month to 246 UCs across the city and almost Rs300 million in a year for the maintenance of manhole covers and streetlights.
“The KWSC has already notified all towns and UCs for smooth supplies of the manhole covers and for the public-level engagement. The mayor has also set up helpline 1334 and email complaint@kmc.gos.pk, asking people to identify any open manholes and report them,” he added.
The move marks the first direct financial intervention by the KMC at the UC level since June 2023, when the current local government system was put in place. Since then, the KMC has largely relied on departmental coordination and inter-agency mechanisms to manage routine tasks, avoiding decentralised financial allocations to the UCs.
The decision comes against the backdrop of intense public outrage following the NIPA tragedy, which reignited criticism over the local government system’s failure to maintain essential civic infrastructure. However, despite releasing funds to the UCs, the authorities have not shared any mechanism to monitor or ensure that the money is spent for its intended purpose.
The official said the new allocation will be released from the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) account, enabling each UC to respond quickly to the complaints, improve neighborhood infrastructure and deliver essential municipal services more effectively. Implemented in August 2024, the KMC aims at generating an annual income of Rs4 billion through the MUCT being collected through K-Electric (KE) bills.
Mayor Wahab hopes that the fresh initiative would help prevent “unfortunate incidents” in the city and to ensure that municipal issues at the local level are addressed promptly and effectively.
“The safety and well-being of Karachi’s citizens remain the city administration’s top priority, and this decision marks another stride toward building a safer, well-lit, and efficiently managed Karachi,” he added.

Judges of superior courts, senior bar members, officers of the Federal Judicial Academy and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) attended the ceremony.
Federal Shariat Court Chief Justice Iqbal Ham­eedur Rehman was seen in the front row, whereas Justice Muha­mmad Karim Khan Agha represented the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) at the oath-taking ceremony.
Supreme Court Regi­strar Muhammad Sohail Laghari conducted the proceedings, while a slew of high court judges were also in attendance.
“This is the first of its kind ceremony in which such a large number of people, be it representatives of different high offices, senior lawyers or court staff, have turned up,” said a senior lawyer who wished not to be named.

The attendance of all IHC judges, despite apparent division among them, was noticed by almost everyone at the ceremony, he said. This shows, he said, Justice Aurangzeb was among the most respected judges of the superior judiciary. “After all he had been their colleague while serving at the high court,” he remarked.
His observation came in view of the overcrowded hall that was full of chairs to accommodate the guests who came in large numbers. Since all the seats were occupied, many were seen standing inside the hall to witness the ceremony.

Published in Dawn, December 9th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-09 04:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960052/rising-fiscal-strain' target='_blank'><strong>Rising fiscal strain</strong></a><br><p>THE sustained and rapid rise in federal civil administration and pension expenditures over the last five years continues to challenge the government’s claims of achieving fiscal discipline. If anything, the surge in these costs despite austerity measures — usually the withdrawal of pro-poor subsidies — job cuts and the ongoing overhaul of federal ministries and departments suggests that the problem is structural.
New finance ministry data shows that the cost of running the government jumped 13pc in the July-September quarter this year — notwithstanding the move to abolish thousands of civil service posts, which the finance minister expects will save Rs56bn annually. Meanwhile, the long-overdue pension reforms will not yield immediate results. In fact, legacy pension payments, which have spiked by 125pc in five years, will take generations and further reforms to decline.
Against this backdrop, the relentless hike in general administration costs is even harder to justify, with the state trying to cope with a severe financial crunch, mounting debt servicing and reduced development spending. The 80pc spike in civil administrative costs since the first quarter of FY22 underlines the failure to tackle the structural budgetary issues that could deliver quicker fiscal relief.
For years, the government has blamed its fiscal stress on the seventh NFC Award, insisting that higher provincial shares have squeezed its ability to finance debt servicing, defence and other obligations. A recent planning ministry report seeks to reinforce this narrative, claiming that the federal deficit has averaged around 7pc of GDP since the Award’s implementation in 2011, up from 4pc in the preceding years. To compensate for its reduced share from the divisible pool, the centre has imposed billions in development levies on petroleum products and gas, and is now attempting to fully or partially take back the financial resources it had ceded to the provinces or shift major expenditure responsibilities to them.

 

However, attributing its fiscal problems to the NFC Award is an attempt to obscure the deeper expenditure problems embedded in the federal structure. Islamabad’s fiscal challenges stem less from the NFC formula than its own inability or unwillingness to reform. Blaming the provinces for its budgetary distress will not solve the structural weaknesses driving federal finances into deficits.
With recurrent federal spending climbing, the centre needs a comprehensive and targeted reform plan that goes beyond symbolic austerity to tackle the institutional drivers of its fiscal strain. This includes right-sizing an oversized bureaucracy, shutting down ministries already devolved to the provinces, and fast-tracking the privatisation of SOEs to contain its wasteful costs. The government must also implement serious tax reforms to lift the tax-to-GDP ratio to 18-20pc instead of attempting to chip away at provincial shares. The centre is mistaken if it thinks that there is an easy way out.

The humanitarian appeals’ immediate priority is to save 87 million lives with $23bn in funding, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Ultimately, in 2026, the aim is to raise a total of $33bn to support 135m people through 23 country operations and six plans for refugees and migrants.
The appeal, titled ‘2026 Response Plan’ earmarks $64.9m to provide assistance to 1.9m people in Pakist­­an. The aim of the appeal, called ‘Life by Life’, is to reach 135m in 50 countries in 2026, the UN agency said.
UNOCHA noted that in 2025, 98m people received help despite funding cuts and attacks on aid workers.

Occupied Palestinian Territory gets the largest individual plan — $4.1bn for three million people

In 2026, the largest individual response plan is for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, where $4.1bn is needed to assist 3 million people who have experienced shocking levels of violence and destruction. In Sudan, the world’s largest displacement crisis, $2.9bn is needed for 20 million people. The largest regional plan is for Syria, with $2.8bn targeted for 8.6 million people.
The highly prioritised appeal follows a year in which humanitarian lifelines were strained and, in some places, snapped due to severe funding cuts. Funding for the 2025 appeal — $12bn — was the lowest in a decade, resulting in 25 million fewer people being reached compared to 2024.
Amidst this devastation, civilians endured blatant disregard for the laws of war, and more than 320 aid workers, the vast majority of them local staff, were killed. The consequences were immediate: hunger surged, health systems came under crushing strain, education collapsed, mine clearance stalled and families suffered blow after blow, with no shelter, no cash assistance and no protection services.
“This appeal sets out where we need to focus our collective energy first: life by life,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher. “The Global Humanitarian Over­view 2026 is grounded in reform, evidence and efficiency. We are shifting power to local organisations, putting more money directly into the hands of those who need it, and, behind all, renewing and reimagining hu­­manitarian action with idealism, humility and hope.”

However, the HEC claimed, it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
The report was filed after a bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan directed the HEC to provide complete academic record of Justice Jahangiri in a case pertaining to his eligibility to hold judicial office.
During the hearing, the court was requested to summon the original academic record directly from Karachi University, which had cancelled the LLB degree awarded to the judge though the university decision was later suspended by the Sindh High Court.
Chief Justice Dogar obs­e­rved that the matter invo­lved a serious allegation and must be examined strictly on the basis of the record. Since the HEC is the regulatory authority for all universities in Paki­s­tan, the bench would first evaluate the commission’s report before deciding whether KU should be iss­u­­ed a notice, he remarked.
In its submission, the HEC enclosed KU’s inquiry report that revealed glaring discrepancies in the judge’s academic record. It stated that candidate ‘Tariq Mehmood’ obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968, but records showed that another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, had been enrolled under the same number in 1987, while the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name of ‘Tariq Jahangiri’.
The report added the judge had also enrolled for LLB Part-I under a second enrolment number, 7124 — a violation of the university’s rules, which permit only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree programme.
The inquiry committee refrained from labelling the degree as ‘bogus’, but it declared the credentials invalid on account of multiple identities and conflicting enrolment records.
The KU alleged the judge “used and appeared in LLB examinations on false identities having different enrolment numbers of Karachi University in collusion with university staff”. It further stated that he had “personified different other regular/ex-regular students of Islamia College, i.e., Mohammad Naeem­uddin, son of Mohammad Moinuddin, and Imtiaz Ahmed.”
As a result, the university declared the candidate guilty of using unfair means, cancelled the result, and imposed a three-year ban, allowing him to reappear in examinations in 1992.

 

The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.

The country’s exports to the region have yet to attain their full potential. Similarly, imports from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to Pakistan have dipped 63.59 percent despite regular high-profile visits to increase the volume of bilateral trade.
In absolute terms, the value of Pakistan’s exports to the five central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — dipped by 9.59pc to $62.545 million in July-October 2025-26 from $69.183m. Imports from the region dipped by 63.59pc to $15.795m in 4MFY26 from $43.392m. The majority of these imports came from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Pakistan’s trade with CACs is between $400 and $500m annually via Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has already implemented its transit trade agreement with Pakistan. Under the agreement, Uzbekistan has started importing goods under the transit agreement as well.
The exports to almost all countries posted a negative growth except Uzbekistan. Similarly, imports dropped during the first four months of the current fiscal year.
Exports to Turkmenistan stood at $0.505m in 4MFY26 from $0.663m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 23.83pc. Imports from Turkmenistan rose 12.64pc to $3.92m against $3.48m over the corresponding months last year.
The export to Uzbekistan surged 51.63pc to $32.95m in 4MFY26 against $21.73m in the corresponding months last year. Imports plunged by 73.85pc to $8.49m from $32.47m.
Shipments to Kazakhstan dropped 16.72pc to $24.54m in 4MFY26 compared to $29.47m. Imports stood at $0.263m against $0.313m over the corresponding months of last year.

ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party.
Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward.
He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government.
“What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role.
‘En masse resignation’
Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued.
He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula.
He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face.
“It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference, wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder.
Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”.
He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected.
“Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security.
Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed.
“We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions.
Financial position
Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time.
“It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase.
The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase.
The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year.
Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said.
The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.

Separately, it wrote to the Punjab Police to trace the mobile phone numbers of the suspects, who had created the fake website and disseminated the fraudulent link.
The PSCA took action when the link, containing fraudulent pending e-challans, was sent to citizens. The link urged recipients to visit the fake website and follow the steps to pay fines.
The authority said that the website and link were not legitimate and confirmed that it was a phishing scheme.


A collage of fraudulent text messages sent to citizens, urging them to pay traffic fines.

PSCA Managing Director Ahsan Younas told Dawn that scammers use the internet for online fraud and apply various tactics to deceive citizens for financial gain.
A team of experts conducted the inquiry and found that a man in Karachi had generated “the alert message with a voice note,” Younas said.
The PSCA then launched an “awareness campaign on a large scale” on social media and alerted citizens that the authority “sends e-challan alerts from the official number 8070” only, Younas added.
It also asked citizens to be careful and verify links via the official authority’s number to avoid online fraud.
A closer look at the contents of the messages revealed the use of the word “urgent,” which the official PSCA website or messages did not use, he said, adding that the domain name of the fake website was different from the original, gop.pk.
PSCA Chief Operating Officer Mustansar Feroz said an investigation found that the mobile number used by the scammer was registered in the name of a woman with no involvement in the fraud.
He added that the suspects acquired mobile phone numbers, SIMs and CNICs of citizens from vendors, saying that this was an alarming situation.
The request submitted to the NCCIA to launch the probe also included action against the scammers for damaging the reputation of the authority, Feroz said.</p><small>2025-12-08 22:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/090000227b07881.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959956/nine-year-old-kainat-defies-heat-and-logic-with-national-games-10000m-bronze' target='_blank'><strong>Nine-year-old Kainat defies heat and logic with National Games 10,000m bronze</strong></a><br><p>On a scorching day of fainting veterans and rifle-shot starts, a girl named Kainat Khalil from Sindh rewrote the meaning of endurance at the 35th National Games.
Athletics at the Games began not with a traditional pistol’s pop, but with the sharp, unexpected report of a rifle cutting through the cool Monday morning at the NPT&SC.
It was an omen. This would be a day of raw, unvarnished struggle, where the starting command itself felt like a call to battle.
The dust from the inaugural men’s 5,000m had barely settled before the December sun perched mercilessly over the open field. It transformed the arena into a kiln, making the very air an opponent.
In the women’s 10,000 metres, the drama was medical: Athletes wilted, fainted and were stretchered away — vanquished not by rivals, but by the searing haze.
Wapda’s Maria Bibi, who would emerge the quickest in 44 minutes and 21 seconds ahead of Navy’s Mumtaz (47:10.11), later stated the obvious with exhausted clarity.
“The heat felt extreme during the race and that’s why the athletes fainted,” Maria told Dawn. It was a race of survival, where the medal was, as Maria put it, “a cherry on the top” of simply finishing.
Amidst this brutal theatre of attrition, a sight unfolded that turned struggle into spectacle, and pain into pure wonder: Nine-year-old Kainat from Sindh running with a rhythm that seemed borrowed from a breeze.
While finishing was a task for veterans, she moved as if she had been training for precisely nine years.
On the final lap, she found a sprint that would have contended in a much shorter race, crossed the line third, and laid down on the track. The stadium’s cheer wasn’t just for a medal; it was a roar of sheer, unadulterated fascination.
After the medal ceremony, the media scrum proved more daunting than 25 laps.
“What do I say? I don’t get it,” the bronze medalist sighed, shrugging, turning her palms upward in helplessness. Coaxed by her coach, she found her voice, slow and sure the second time.
“My name is Kainat Khalil and I compete in long distance running. This is my first time competing at nationals,” the shy nine-year old told Dawn.
Then, the truth she made her own. “This was not possible but I made it possible,” she parroted what her coach had gently said to her just seconds before.
What goes through a child’s mind during such an ordeal? “Just that I need to run. However much there is to run, I will.”
Asked if she enjoyed this masochistic craft, the doll-sized athlete nodded a vigorous “yes!” Her advice to her peers was timeless. “Work really, really hard to get what you want.”
Before the sweat had dried, her eyes were already set on the Karachi marathon and then an international stage, where she dreams of gold for Pakistan.
ARSHAD’S SOARING JAVELIN
In her staggering feat, one could see the raw, uncut diamond of a potential that follows in the wake of the nation’s established stars — a lineage that leads directly to the global podium where Pakistan’s javelin star, Arshad Nadeem, has already shown what such belief, paired with supreme talent, can achieve.
The Paris 2024 winner Arshad, according to everyone’s expectations, clinched the gold medal with a 81.81m throw on his third and final attempt.
“This is one of the biggest events for the youth of our country, and it’s where I began participating” Arshad told Dawn, “That’s how I began my journey. There’s plenty of athletes coming out of these games that will compete for Pakistan next year at the Commonwealth Games or Asian Games, for example. The way I make Pakistan proud when I compete abroad, so will they.”
Around Kainat, who had a whole future ahead of her, and Arshad who reached the pinnacle, there were other champions who painted a chorus of adult burdens.
The women’s 100m saw Olympian Faiqa Riaz reclaim her title as Pakistan’s fastest woman, screaming in delight after battling back the self-doubt that followed her Olympic debut.
Self-doubt had overtaken her confidence after she lost two major local championships following her Paris 2024 debut, she told Dawn after the race.
“I’ve just reclaimed my national games title and I’m immensely proud,” she vowed, a veteran rewriting her own narrative.
She bagged gold for Wapda in 11:70 while Khoula Umer Khan of HEC won silver in 12:03 and Army’s Tameen Khan settled for bronze in 12:10.In the men’s 100m, Samiullah of Wapda won gold with a hamstring pulled a month prior, his triumph laced with private struggle. “I had to pay for all of my medical expenses on my own,” Samiullah, who finished in a modest time of 10:30, revealed to Dawn.
Army’s Usman Ali (10.40) and Rashid Riaz (10.45) bagged silver and bronze medals, respectively.
In the 3000m steeplechase, Talha Saleem spoke of a year’s singular focus. “I took no day off for six months,” he told Dawn, his gold medal a product of monastic sacrifice.
Their stories — of injury, doubt, isolation and financial strain — formed the hard ground of elite sport.
From the shot put circle, Nabeela Riaz, dominating the national circuit for four years, threw a personal best of 12.48m to claim another gold for Army.
But she lamented, while talking to Dawn, competing only “once or twice a year” — a champion from a small town of Sarai Alamgir in Gujrat district pleading for more stages to prove her might.
The day’s action ended with the pole vault in fading light as US-based Noreen Hussain, leaping for Army and for the image of a Pakistan she loves, took gold with a leap of 2.90 metres.
“Just the opportunity to compete in Pakistan when you are from here is quite fascinating,” she told Dawn.
ARMY ON TOP
Medals were clinched across the city on Monday with Pakistan Army strengthening their position at the top of the table with 46 golds to Wapda’s 14.
Army swept all golds on offer in the taekwondo poomsae event.
The men’s gold medals were secured by Aqdasullah Qadeer and Mohammad Sarmad Waheed (Under 30 Pair), Shahbaz Gul and Ibrar-ul-Haq (Over 30 Pair), and Aqdas, Haris Deedar, and Ahmad Shahzad (Under 30 Team). Ameer Hamza added an Over 17 freestyle gold.
On the women’s side, Naila and Zeena Sheraz won the Under 30 Pair, while Mehrun Nisa and Urooj Bashir dominated the Over 30 Pair. Other winners included Zymal Naqvi (Over 17 Freestyle), and the army’s mixed pairs also took home gold medals across different categories.
In the shooting competition, Pakistan Olympian Gulfam Joseph won gold along with Kaleemullah and Azhar Abbas in the 50m Pistol team event for Army. Pakistan Navy’s Shahrukh Khan took gold in the category’s individual event.
Army’s Mehr Khaliq, Zikra Shoukat and Captain Aqsa Shabbir won the gold medal in the 10m Air Rifle team category while Mehr took the individual honours.
In rugby, Wapda claimed both the men’s and women’s gold medals defeating Army 19-0 and Punjab 15-0 respectively.
The fencing competition at NED University saw Naeem from Punjab clinch the gold medal in the men’s Sabre event. Ali Ahmed from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) took home the silver, while Shoaib of Sindh and Baryal from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shared the bronze.
Wapda and Army booked a final clash in the men’s tennis team event.</p><small>2025-12-08 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/082349354dbc24a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959957/saudi-arabia-qatar-sign-high-speed-rail-deal-to-link-capitals' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar sign high-speed rail deal to link capitals</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Monday signed a deal to construct a high-speed rail connecting the Gulf countries’ capitals, marking the latest sign of improved ties between the two nations that were once deeply at odds.
According to a statement in the official Saudi press, the “high-speed electric passenger railway” would connect Riyadh and Doha. The Saudi cities of Al-Hofuf and Dammam are also expected to be on the network.
The train would reach speeds exceeding 300 kilometres per hour and the trip would take roughly two hours between the two capitals. A direct flight between the cities clocks in at around 90 minutes.
The project, set to be completed in six years, expects to serve 10 million passengers per year, the statement said.







The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during the latter’s visit to Riyadh.
The deal is just the latest in a series of moves marking the dramatic improvement in ties between the Gulf countries in recent years.
Saudi Arabia and its allies, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, had cut all diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017.
The four nations accused Doha of backing radical extremists and seeking closer ties with Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival Tehran — allegations that Qatar vehemently denied.
Relations were fully restored in January 2021 after a summit in the Saudi desert city of Al Ula.
Prince Mohammed visited Doha in December 2021 for the first time since the thaw in ties, as part of a regional Gulf tour.
Since then, leaders from the two monarchies have met regularly and joined forces to back diplomatic initiatives, including calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Riyadh also threw its support behind Qatar following Israeli strikes on Doha over the summer.</p><small>2025-12-08 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08213126487b1fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959951/pakistan-did-not-benefit-from-pti-project-aqeel-malik' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan did not benefit from PTI ‘project’: Aqeel Malik</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik on Monday stated that Pakistan did not benefit from the PTI “project”, arguing that it aimed to destroy the country.
In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The PTI emphatically deplored the “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson, saying the party founder was “not a security threat” and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the minister highlighted that during its tenure, the PTI government “ran a campaign against the country, writing to the IMF and lobbying US politicians”.
“Has the PTI taken a single beneficial step for Pakistan?” Malik asked, further questioning what development projects are underway in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the party is running the provincial administration.
“When it comes to sovereignty and national security, we (PML-N) have never compromised,” he added. “There is a night and day difference between the policies of the PTI and the PML-N.”
Malik pointed out that Imran himself claimed, when he was in power, that the army chief was akin to the “father of the nation” and that nobody could speak out against him.
“Look at what Imran Khan is saying on Twitter,” he added, referring to posts against Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“I can say that the youth have introspected and found that countries cannot progress on hollow words, hollow promises and pure popularity,” Malik added.
“I am not denying that there are questions around the 2024 general elections, but did Nawaz Sharif write any letters to the IMF? Was he involved in foreign lobbying?”
Later, PTI Chief Whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar joined the programme and was asked about allegations labeling Imran a “security threat” by senior political and military leadership.
“Who is (Information Minister) Atta Tarar to say these things about us?” Dogar replied. “He is a Form 47 politician who has only 16,000 votes, and now he’s lecturing the party of the country’s legitimate leader.”
“No power can stop Imran Khan. They cannot stop us from speaking or protesting. We have endured so much over the past three years. What more can they do to us?”
Dogar then highlighted how PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif gave interviews to Indian journalists and asked whether those would be forgotten.
In response to a question about the PTI founder being called a security threat, Dogar said, “This is unfortunate and has been going on for 75 years. Fatima Jinnah, the mother of the nation, was once declared a security risk by Ayub Khan.”
He also cited the examples of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman being deemed a security threat by Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto being declared a security threat by Ziaul Haq, stating that the country’s most popular leaders have been targeted throughout Pakistan’s history.
“Where did all these people — Yahya, Ayub Khan — go? Political figures return in some way or another, because ideas never die,” Dogar stated.
“Under this hybrid system, Pakistan’s future has been imprisoned. Read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission; the situation is similar.”
Imran’s social media ‘not under’ party’s control
When questioned about Imran’s social media accounts, Dogar noted that the account is not under the party’s control, nor is it under Imran’s.
“Even today, in a parliamentary committee meeting, we agreed that messages from Imran in jail should not be disseminated like a vlogger outside the prison gates,” he said. “The party realises that we need to do whatever we can to ensure the release of our leader and workers.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that Dogar’s statement had been misunderstood.
“He meant that there were several young members in the social media team, but after the crackdown they left the country and are now operating their accounts on their own,” he said.
Responding to a question, he said that whenever a leader or family member meets Imran Khan, the message is written on a piece of paper and then sent abroad, after which it is tweeted as it is.
“The messages are sent directly abroad and then tweeted. They are not issued through the party’s media wing, so the media wing has nothing to do with them,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-08 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08193650486cbf5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959945/76-magnitude-quake-jolts-japans-east-coast-local-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>7.6 magnitude quake jolts Japan’s east coast: local authorities</strong></a><br><p>The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) on Monday reported a 7.6 magnitude earthquake off the coast of its eastern Aomori prefecture.
The JMA reported that the epicentre of the quake was registered off the coast of Aomori at a depth of 80 kilometres at 11:15pm local time (7:15pm PKT).
On Japan’s 1-7 scale of seismic intensity, the tremor registered as an “upper 6” in Aomori prefecture — a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without crawling.
In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and windowpanes are damaged in many buildings.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and tsunamis from 20 to 70 cm (7 to 27 inches) high were observed at several ports, JMA said.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK World reported that a tsunami warning had been issued 10 minutes later, urging citizens along the northeast coast to evacuate. Waves were estimated to reach a height of three metres.
There have been no reports of casualties, but NHK reported that “abnormalities at nuclear power plants and other facilities in various locations” are being examined.
No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants in the region run by Tohoku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, the utilities said. Tohoku Electric initially said thousands of households had lost power, but later lowered that number to the hundreds.
East Japan Railway suspended some services in the area, but as of 9pm PKT, there was little information on major damage from NHK.
“There is a possibility that further powerful and stronger earthquakes could occur over the next several days,” a JMA official said at a briefing.
The yen weakened against major currencies after news of the tremor, before regaining some ground.
Japan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes.
Located in the “Ring of Fire” of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20 per cent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.
The northeastern region suffered one of the country’s deadliest earthquakes on March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude tremor struck under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai.
It was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan and set off a series of massive tsunamis that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000 people.
The 2011 tsunami also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years.</p><small>2025-12-08 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/082011032884172.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959946/dumper-truck-kills-motorcyclist-in-north-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dumper truck kills motorcyclist in North Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>In another fatal incident involving a heavy vehicle, a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday, according to police.
New Karachi Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Saud said the deceased, Hameedur Rehman, was riding a motorcycle under the Nagan bridge when the dumper crushed him to death.
People gathered at the spot where the incident occurred, caught the dumper driver, Allah Rakha, and beat him until the police arrived. The police then took the accused into custody.
The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
The spot did not have closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to capture the incident, the SHO said and added that the incident occurred around 11:30 am.
Eyewitnesses, present at the scene, informed the police that the motorcyclist was driving on the wrong side of the road.
Rise in heavy vehicle accidents
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed.
On November 4, angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them.
On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles, including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested.
On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters.
August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town.
In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.</p><small>2025-12-08 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08152303633d949.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959936/punjab-transporters-call-off-wheel-jam-strike-after-talks-with-provincial-govt-acceptance-of-demands' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab transporters call off wheel-jam strike after talks with provincial govt, ‘acceptance of demands’</strong></a><br><p>Transporters called off a Punjab-wide strike on Monday after talks with the provincial government representatives, with one of the participants included in the negotiations confirming to Dawn that authorities had largely agreed to transporters’ demands.
The call for the strike today, which was also observed in Islamabad, was given by transporters’ bodies primarily in protest against a new traffic ordinance that significantly increased traffic fines.
To discuss the matter, talks were held between representatives from the Punjab government, who were led by the provincial transport minister, Bilal Akbar, and a delegation of the Mutahidda Transporters’ Association’s action committee.
After the meeting, action committee member Lala Yasir told Dawn that the transporters called off the strike after the government accepted their demands.
He said that apart from the revision of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the transporters also demanded an end to the registration of first information reports against drivers and owners of heavy vehicles over even minor violations of traffic laws.
According to Yasir, the government agreed that no cases would be registered against or huge fines would be imposed on drivers and vehicle owners.
Moreover, he said, the government also agreed to form committees to  review and discuss the ordinance with transporters’ representatives, and subsequently make changes to the new law in light of recommendations by the representatives of transporter associations.
A meeting between the two sides has been scheduled for tomorrow as well, he said.
Earlier, Muttahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairperson Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that while negotiations were under way, “the government is not interested in resolving the matter and even attempted to divide the [transporters’] association”.
Partial suspension of public transport in twin cities
In Islamabad and Rawalpindi, operations of public transport remained partially suspended earlier today as transporters observed a wheel-jam strike.
At the day’s start, lesser than usual traffic was seen on the roads in the twins cities following the call for the strike. There were also reports of school van owners joining the strike and passengers facing difficulties at main bus stands.
Pirwadhai General Bus Stand, one of the main bus terminals in Rawalpindi, also saw less than usual activity and vehicles for inter-provincial travel were seen lining the bus bays.
While public transport on main roads largely remained suspended, Qingqi rickshaws, small vans and small loading vehicles were operating in Rawalpindi’s commercial areas, including Raja Bazaar, and link roads.
The Goods Transport Association had also joined the strike, but Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi claimed while speaking to Dawn that goods-carrying vehicles remained operational “despite threats from associations”.
The official said the government “will facilitate the vehicles that will remain on roads”.
On the other hand, there were reports of the supply of food and essential items getting affected due to the suspension of goods transport at Grand Trunk Road — a major north-south artery that traverses the country.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:18</small></div><hr>
