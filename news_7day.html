<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2518330710f2c14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937098/fm-dar-says-greater-israel-plan-a-direct-threat-to-regional-peace' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says ‘Greater Israel’ plan a direct threat to regional peace</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday addressed the extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM) in Jeddah, stating that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks about a “Greater Israel” threaten regional peace.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 62,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip. Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”
Dar said that in recent days, Israel exhibited its “characteristic sordid insensitivity to international norms” with highly provocative and unwarranted statements encapsulating its “growing disdain and absolute contempt” for the international order.
“The brazen audacity of the so-called Israeli cabinet, in unveiling its ominous plan to extend Israel’s full military control over Gaza, as well as the Israeli prime minister’s recent allusion to the creation of a ‘Greater Israel’ provides an insight into Israel’s annexationist and rogue mindset.”
Pakistan strongly condemned Netanyahu’s remarks, stating that they call for action that would aggravate the already dire humanitarian situation and undermine efforts for peace in the Gaza Strip.
 


“We joined the statement issued by the Arab-Islamic Ministerial Committee, along with other countries, in expressing strong condemnation and categorical rejection of the Israeli announcement, denouncing it as an unacceptable escalation and a brazen attempt to entrench illegal occupation by coercion,” he said.
Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the Secretaries General of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Netanyahu’s comments about “Greater Israel”.
“His (Netanyahu’s) statement constitutes a direct threat to Arab national security, to the sovereignty of states, and to regional and international peace and security,” Dar stated.
“The root cause of this ongoing tragedy is Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” Dar said, quoting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “We fully stand by our brotherly Arab states in safeguarding their sovereignty against threats to their independence and territorial integrity.”
‘Wanton acts of collective punishment’
Dar called Gaza “a graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law”, lamenting the deaths of over 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.
“The systematic targeting of hospitals, schools, UN facilities, aid convoys and refugee camps are not incidental, these are wanton acts of collective punishment in full world view,” the deputy PM said.
“Gaza is enduring a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe. For nearly two years, it has suffered indiscriminate bombardment, total blockade, and deliberate deprivation and starvation, while violence and dispossession escalate in the West Bank and Jerusalem.”
 






The deputy PM highlighted that the humanitarian system in place was a “cruel illusion” and noted that an unprecedented hunger crisis and famine are rampant in the coastal enclave.
“Pakistan expresses its deep appreciation to all the states and stakeholders that are playing a role in advancing peace in Gaza. Their ongoing contributions and steadfast support remain essential in the pursuit of stability and justice for the Palestinian people,” he stated.
Dar also welcomed “international momentum” towards the recognition of a Palestinian state by governments around the world and appreciated the International Conference on the Two-State Solution, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, on July 28.
“We urge those states that have yet to recognise the State of Palestine to do so as soon as they can,” he urged.
“We need to do more. It (the conference) must now be followed up by coordinated international action to realise the long-overdue settlement, based on a viable, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital,” Dar added.
‘A defining moment for the Muslim Ummah’
Dar outlined that Palestinians no longer need messages of sympathy but concrete action to end their suffering and ensure their freedom from Israeli occupation.
“This is a defining moment for the Muslim Ummah. History will not judge us by our words but by our actions,” he emphasised.
“The OIC must rise to this challenge with unity, resolve, and purpose. Another Nakba cannot, and must not, be allowed to happen,” he added, referring to the incident when 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948 war with Israel.
Highlighting that the Palestinian question is a litmus test for the rules-based international order, FM Dar presented the following seven “urgent and essential steps” for ending the Gaza crisis:

An immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire across Gaza and
the occupied Palestinian territory with full implementation of UNSC
resolutions
Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians
in need and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN
personnel
Reinforce international support to UNRWA — which remains
indispensable to the survival of millions of Palestinians — with the
OIC playing a proactive role in this end
An end to forced displacement, illegal settlements and annexation of
Palestinian land, particularly in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
The implementation of the OIC’s reconstruction plan for Gaza, which
represents a vital framework for post-conflict recovery and
rehabilitation, sustainable development and the restoration of
dignity of the people of Palestine
The revival of a genuine process to achieve a just, comprehensive and
a lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and
relevant UN and OIC resolutions
Accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity

The deputy PM also held meetings on the sidelines of the OIC session with his counterparts from Iran and Saudi Arabia, Dar wrote in separate posts on X.
Dar met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, where the pair “discussed the grave situation in Gaza, strongly condemning Israeli aggression, genocide and famine, and emphasised the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian aid and a lasting ceasefire”.
Additionally, the two top diplomats recalled Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan and discussed Pakistani-Iranian ties and exchanged views on peace and security in the region and beyond, Dar wrote.
 






Dar separately met Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan, where the pair discussed Saudi-Pakistani ties and exchanged views on “key regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
“We discussed the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the ongoing genocide, famine and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, reconstruction, and lasting peace,” the deputy PM wrote.
 






Earlier, Dar arrived in Jeddah to attend the meeting on the Gaza crisis amid Israeli aggression and plans to seize full control of Gaza City, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar […] has arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in the 21st Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) being held today at the OIC Secretariat in Jeddah,” the FO said in the statement.
“The DPM/FM was received at the King Abdulaziz International Airport Jeddah by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to OIC, Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah, Khalid Majid.”
 






It added that the session will bring together foreign ministers and senior officials from the OIC member states to deliberate on coordinated responses to the escalating developments in Palestine, arising from the ongoing Israeli military aggression, proposed plans for full military control over Gaza, and the continuing egregious violations of Palestinian rights.
Yesterday, the FO said FM Dar will reject Israel’s “outrageous” plan to occupy Gaza at the extraordinary session and emphasise the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian assistance.
“He will reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestine and reiterate its principled stance and call for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, most notably, the establishment of an independent, contiguous, and sovereign Palestinian state,” it said.
The OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations, with 57 member states. It was established in September 1969 in response to the Israeli terrorist attacks on Al Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem.
As a founding member, Pakistan has been at the forefront of the OIC’s efforts to champion Muslim causes — from freedom of the Palestinian and Kashmiri peoples struggling under foreign occupation, to upholding the rights of Muslims in Myanmar and Bosnia, to ending conflicts in Muslim lands such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
‘Complete control’ of Gaza
Last week, Tel Aviv approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.
Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.
Hamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire, saying that a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.
The proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Once a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.
Netanyahu said last Thursday that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners held by Hamas — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living, and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.
‘Manmade’ famine
According to a report released last week by the Famine Review Committee of the United Nations’ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made” and could be “halted and reversed”, but it required an “immediate, at-scale response” to do so.
“The time for debate and hesitation has passed; starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the committee said in a report.
“There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”
The report also warned that avoidable deaths would “increase exponentially” unless a ceasefire was implemented to allow in humanitarian aid and restore the delivery of food and basic supplies to Gaza’s population immediately.
Pakistan dispatches aid
Meanwhile, a fresh consignment of 100 tons of relief goods was dispatched to Palestine from the Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore via a special flight on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking the 21st consignment dispatched for the people of Gaza, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The consignment includes ration bags, ready-to-eat meals, and canned fruits to meet the urgent food needs of the Palestinian people. With this dispatch, the total volume of aid sent by Pakistan to Gaza has reached 2,027 tons through 21 consignments, the report said.

The 70.7-metre-tall Super Heavy booster and its 52m-tall Starship upper half sat stacked on a launch mount at SpaceX’s Starbase rocket facilities as it was being filled with propellant ahead of a liftoff time of 7:35pm ET (4:35am PKT).
But roughly 30 minutes from liftoff, SpaceX said on X that it was standing down to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems.
 






Musk had been poised to provide an update on Starship’s development progress prior to the rocket’s launch on Sunday, but a placeholder live stream indicated it had been cancelled.
Similar postponements in the past have been resolved in a matter of days. SpaceX is now targeting as soon as Monday, August 25, for Starship’s next launch attempt, according to its website.
Development of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, the centre of the company’s powerful launch business future and Musk’s Mars ambitions, has faced repeated hiccups this year.
Two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space on its ninth flight and a massive test stand explosion in June that sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s test-to-failure development approach.
Still, the company has continued to swiftly produce new Starships for test flights at its sprawling Starbase production facilities. Nasa hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027 for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo programme.
The setbacks underscore the technical complexities of Starship’s latest iteration, packed with far more capabilities such as increased thrust, a potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to nailing its atmospheric reentry — key traits for Starship’s rapid reusability that Musk has long pushed for.
The stacked system had been expected to blast off from Texas around sunset on Sunday before its Starship upper stage separated from the Super Heavy booster dozens of miles in altitude. Super Heavy, which has returned for a landing at its launch pad in giant mechanical arms in past tests, would have instead targeted the Gulf of Mexico for a soft water landing in order to test a backup engine configuration.
Starship was to briefly ignite its own engines to blast further into space, where it would have attempted to release its first batch of mock Starlink satellites and reignite an engine while on a suborbital path around the planet.
After that phase, the ship targets an atmospheric reentry over the Indian Ocean, a crucial flight phase that tests a variety of prototypical heat shield tiles and engine flaps designed to endure a barrage of blazing heat that has largely shredded the rocket’s exterior during past flights.
“Starship’s reentry profile is designed to intentionally stress the structural limits of the upper stage’s rear flaps while at the point of maximum entry dynamic pressure,” SpaceX said on its website.</p><small>2025-08-25 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251649276bd2a36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937118/karachi-atc-sends-farhan-ghani-2-others-on-4-day-physical-remand-in-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC sends Farhan Ghani, 2 others on 4-day physical remand in employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday sent Chanesar Town Municipal Corporation (TMC) Chairman Farhan Ghani on a four-day physical remand over the alleged assault of a government employee.
Farhan, brother of PPP leader and Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, was arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case on Sunday for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal. Saeed had said his brother and his associates would voluntarily surrender themselves and prove their “innocence in court”.
Farhan, Shakeel and Qamar Ahmed were produced before the ATC today upon the completion of their one-day police custody.
The court asked the IO the charges under which the accused were booked, to which the IO responded that the accused had beaten up the complainant while he and others were laying down the fibre optic cable on Sharea Faisal.
Farhan, who did not have legal representation, denied the claim, stating that he was “falsely accused”. He went on to say that he was only passing by and, as TMC chairman, he had a “right to ask why the area had been dug up”.
“I asked for a permission certificate, but they could not produce one,” Farhan claimed, adding that it is his job “to stop anything illegal”.
In response to the court’s enquiry on how the suspects were arrested, the IO said they had turned themselves in.
 
 

The IO then requested the judge to grant the police 14-day custody of the suspects for further investigation. However, the court approved a four-day physical remand till August 28.
It also ordered the IO to present a progress report at the next hearing.
Complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon had filed a first information report (FIR) at the Ferozabad police station on late Saturday night.
According to the FIR, at around 4:47pm on August 22, around 20-25 persons, including Farhan, arrived at the site of the incident in three vehicles and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal.
Jadoon alleged that he told them he had all the required permissions, but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said that when he insisted that he had all the required no-objection certificates, they started using abusive language and beating him.
He went on to say that the men dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station, keeping him in illegal confinement and continued to beat him.
In the meantime, a police team arrived and rescued the complainant. They took him to the police station, where he lodged the FIR.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251603587ab4243.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937111/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-key-pti-leaders-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-57-others-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, 57 others to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday sentenced key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and Zartaj Gul, along with 56 others, to 10 years in jail and acquitted 34 in the case of an attack on former interior minister Rana Sanaullah’s house during the May 9, 2023 riots.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh presided over today’s hearing of the case registered at the Samanabad police on May 9, 2023.
PTI legal team head Malik Khalid Shafiq confirmed the convictions to Dawn.com. He said that out of the total 109 accused, 59 were handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and 16 were given three years’ jail time.
Ayub, Faraz and Gul, as well as Muhammad Ahmad Chattha, were recently disqualified from their parliamentary seats following their convictions in other May 9 cases.
Other PTI leaders included Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed), Ashraf Khan Sohna, Rai Hassan Nawaz, Rai Murtaza Iqbal, former MNA Kanwal Shauzab and former Punjab MPA Farah Agha. They were also convicted in other May 9 cases on July 31.
 
 

Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, who quit PTI in the wake of the May 9 incidents, and MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi) were among those freed of the charges today.
Fawad and Zain had also been acquitted in three other Faisalabad cases pertaining to the May 9 riots.
PTI parliamentarians convicted would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
Reacting to the court verdict, Gul said on X that she was innocent.
She contended that the verdict was based on the argument that she was present in a meeting held at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7, 2023, where plans for the protest were reportedly made.
However, according to Gul, she was present in her Dera Ghazi Khan constituency on that day, attending a “fateha, inauguration, wedding and other events”. She also shared screengrabs of social media posts that showed her activities that day, adding that she had presented this evidence in court.
 






The deadline given to ATCs to decide various May 9 cases had already passed earlier this month. Therefore, day-to-day hearings were being held in the case, according to PTI lawyer Shafiq.
Last week, the Kasur Crime Control Department (CCD) presented former Faisalabad Civil Lines station house officer Zeeshan Khalid Randhawa as a witness during the trial. The former SHO was already under arrest in a separate kidnap and murder case of a Kasur resident.
A joint investigation team probing the case had been summoned by an ATC in July 2024 to submit the charge sheet.
Sentences against opposition pile up
Today’s convictions are the latest in a slew of ATC sentences, wherein over 100 PTI leaders and workers have been handed lengthy jail terms.
On July 22, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, incarcerated Shah Mahmood Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
 
 

The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced as many as 32 accused, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in a case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On July 31, a Faisalabad ATC had senten­ced over 100 PTI leaders and workers to up to 10 years’ imprisonment in three cases. Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among key opposition leaders handed 10 years’ jail time.
In one case, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted. In another case, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, while one person received a three-year sentence and 77 were acquitted.
On August 1, a Sargodha ATC sentenced PTI worker Muham­mad Ismail to rigorous life imprisonment in May 9 cases related to an attack on the judicial complex in Mianwali and declared 50 others as proclaimed offenders.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25171910ea71a5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937116/man-allegedly-throws-acid-on-wife-following-domestic-dispute-in-faisalabad' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly throws acid on wife following domestic dispute in Faisalabad</strong></a><br><p>A woman was left injured on Monday after her husband allegedly threw acid on her during a domestic dispute in Samundri tehsil of Punjab’s Faisalabad district, according to the police.
An incident report from the City Samundri Police station house officer said a call was received at 7:22am that a man had thrown acid on the caller’s daughter in Housing Colony No. 1, adding that she was in critical condition and being taken to the hospital.
The SHO added that he and other police personnel reached the Samundri Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, where the victim’s father told them that his daughter was married to the suspect about a year ago but was still living with her parents.
The father told the police that the couple had an argument earlier today over household expenditure, due to which the husband got angry and threw acid on her, wounding her face, left shoulder and hands.
The report added that doctors administered first aid and referred her to the Allied Burn & Reconstructive Surgery Centre. The SHO said that legal proceedings were being implemented in the case.
Police spokesperson Mohammad Tariq told Dawn.com that raids were underway and the suspect would be arrested soon.
Acid attacks remain a persistent form of gender-based violence in Pakistan, often stemming from domestic disputes, with survivors facing lifelong physical and psychological trauma. In April, the Punjab government, in view of acid attacks on women, finalised a bill to regulate the business of acid in Punjab.
The draft law restricts every person from carrying out the business of acid without a licence. It instructs that no acid shall be sold to the person below the age of 18 years. The law has listed 30 types of acid.
On Sunday, a woman and a man suffered serious burns in separate acid attacks in Bahawalpur.
In June, an anti-terrorism court in Sahiwal sentenced a man to 14 years in prison and imposed a fine of Rs8.1 million for critically injuring his former mother-in-law and her 10-year-old son in a brutal acid attack.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25163642cc90e83.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937122/fake-firs-being-circulated-on-fias-behalf-used-for-blackmail-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Fake FIRs being circulated on FIA’s behalf, used for blackmail: agency</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Monday warned that criminals are circulating fake first information reports using the agency’s name to blackmail people, according to a press release.
“FIA has received information that criminal elements are harassing people by sending fake and fabricated FIRs on WhatsApp in the name of” the agency, the press release, available with Dawn.com, stated. “Citizens are named in fake FIRs and terrorised.”
 






“These elements try to present themselves as FIA officials by using fictitious and misleading names,” the agency added. “In such messages, attempts are being made to blackmail citizens by making serious allegations like ‘cybercrimes and terrorism’.”
The FIA stated that it does not send messages of this nature to people via WhatsApp and urged the public to file complaints about suspicious messages with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which is the “authorised agency to investigate cybercrime”.
“Beware of fake messages, and never share your personal and financial information,” the FIA said.
A copy of the fake FIR was also shared with Dawn.com, registered under Sections 11H (fundraising), 11N (punishment under Sections 11H to 11K) and 11Q *(forfeiture) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, read with Section 3 (offence of money laundering) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010 and Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
On August 8, the agency warned citizens against “fake emails and WhatsApp messages” being sent in its name.
“The FIA has received reports that some unknown individuals are harassing the public by sending fake emails and WhatsApp messages in the name of the DG FIA,” a statement issued by the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Ghaffar, read.
“In these fake messages, the public is being terrorised by using the name and position of DG FIA,” the statement said, adding that fraudsters put a fake stamp of “Top Secret” on these messages to make them appear authentic.
On August 5, the Digital Rights Foundation issued an alert warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25153230bfe27c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937115/worlds-first-commercial-co2-graveyard-opens-in-norway' target='_blank'><strong>World’s first commercial CO2 ‘graveyard’ opens in Norway</strong></a><br><p>The world’s first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway’s coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said on Monday.
Northern Lights, led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe.
The aim is to prevent emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.
“We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,” Northern Lights’ managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. “Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.”
In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway’s western coast.
It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 110-kilometre (68-mile) pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 2.6 kilometres, for permanent storage.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries like cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonise.
The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany’s Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.
But CCS technology is complex and costly. Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase “pollution permits” on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.
Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe.
One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted’s biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.
Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.5 million tonnes, which is expected to increase to five million tonnes by the end of the decade.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25164040ba8ccfb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937121/fo-confirms-indias-flood-warnings-notes-use-of-diplomatic-channel-over-iwc' target='_blank'><strong>FO confirms India’s flood warnings, notes use of diplomatic channel over IWC</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Monday said India had shared flood warnings with Pakistan but stressed that the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under paragraph 8 of Article IV of the IWT, “each party agrees to communicate to the other party, as far in advance as practicable, any information it may have in regard to such extraordinary discharges of water from reservoirs and flood flows as may affect the other party”.
Punjab is on high alert for floods before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell as the provincial government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
Amid the situation, a missive on Sunday from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, notified the government of a high flood in Jammu’s Tawi River that flows into the Chenab River.
Confirming the development today, FO Spokesperson Shahfqat Ali Khan said: “On August 24, 2025, India communicated flood warnings through diplomatic channels, rather than through the IWC as required under the IWT.
“We reaffirm that India is obligated to fully comply with all provisions of the treaty. India’s unilateral declaration to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a serious violation of international law and could have significant negative consequences for peace and stability in South Asia.”
An Indian government source told Reuters today that the country shared the warning on possible cross-border flooding on “humanitarian grounds” and not under the IWT.
The Indian High Commission in Islamabad shared the warning following heavy rains in occupied Kashmir, the source said. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The source declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><small>2025-08-25 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251547156ad415f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937112/two-fc-personnel-martyred-18-injured-in-hangu-terrorist-attack-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two FC personnel martyred, 18 injured in Hangu terrorist attack: police</strong></a><br><p>At least two Federal Constabulary (FC) personnel were martyred and 18 others were injured in a terrorist attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Monday.
Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed confirmed the incident to Dawn.com, saying that terrorists attacked an FC fort in the Torah Wadi area of ​​Doaba. “The terrorist fired and martyred two FC personnel and injured 18 others,” he said.
The officer said that the FC soldiers retaliated to the attack, “resulting in the death of six terrorists”. He added, “The terrorists managed to escape with the bodies of their accomplices.”
He also said that the martyred and injured personnel were taken to CMH Hospital after being provided with first aid.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the terrorist attack on the Federal Reserve Police fort in Hangu by Fitna al Hindustan, state media APP reported.
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
In a statement today, Naqvi paid tribute to the FC personnel “who embraced martyrdom while bravely resisting the assault” and directed authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured personnel.
“The brave officers of the Federal Reserve Police [the term used for FC personnel] sacrificed their lives to foil the attack of India-sponsored terrorists,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “The sacrifices of our martyrs will never go in vain.“
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Last month, nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Hangu.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in KP’s Bannu district on the night of July 16.</p><small>2025-08-25 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251527453cf0819.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937113/traffic-accident-kills-3-at-karachis-drigh-road-underpass-police' target='_blank'><strong>Traffic accident kills 3 at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed and one was injured after a car hit a motorcycle at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass on Monday, officials said.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
A spokesperson for the Eastern District police said that the accident took place within the limits of the Sharea Faisal police station.
“According to initial information, a car hit a motorcycle, causing serious injuries to passers-by who were taken to the hospital,” the spokesperson said.
He added that the driver of the car had been arrested and the vehicle was in custody.
Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre confirmed three fatalities, including two men and an unidentified woman, adding that another woman was injured. All were taken to Jinnah Hospital via Edhi ambulance.
The traffic police have issued an alert that the Drigh Road Underpass is blocked due to the incident, saying that an accident analysis team was inspecting the site.
“Traffic is being diverted over the underpass,” it added, directing citizens to the Traffic Police Helpline at 1915 to choose alternate routes.
Last week, a head-on collision involving a passenger coach and two pickups on the Quetta-Karachi national highway killed at least nine people, including police personnel, and left eight others injured.
Earlier this month, a couple was run over and killed by a fast-moving dumper truck in Karachi’s Sultanabad area.</p><small>2025-08-25 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251359025df6ea8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937109/fitch-maintains-its-rating-on-india-citing-strong-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Fitch maintains its rating on India, citing strong growth</strong></a><br><p>Credit-rating firm Fitch on Monday maintained its long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on India at ‘BBB-’, citing the country’s strong economic growth and resilient external finances.
“India’s economic outlook remains strong relative to peers, even as momentum has moderated in the past two years,” Fitch said in a statement.
The agency forecast GDP growth of 6.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (FY26), unchanged from FY25, and well above the ‘BBB’ median of 2.5pc.
Fitch’s rating comes days after S&P Global Ratings lifted its sovereign credit rating on India, citing strong economic growth, marking its first upgrade in 18 years.
Economic Affairs Secretary Anuradha Thakur had then said she expects other rating agencies to take note of the factors behind S&P’s upgrade and follow suit.
Domestic demand will remain “solid”, helped by the government’s ongoing capital spending drive and steady private consumption, Fitch said, but flagged that private investment will remain moderate due to risks from US tariffs.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50pc — among the highest rates imposed on Washington’s trade partners — targeting India’s oil purchases from Russia. The 50pc tariffs are set to kick in from August 27.
 
 

“US tariffs are a moderate downside risk to our forecast,” Fitch said, adding that they will reduce India’s ability to benefit from supply chain shifts out of China if tariff levels fail to be negotiated lower.
“Proposed goods and services tax (GST) reforms, if adopted, would support consumption, offsetting some of these growth risks,” Fitch added, referring to the tax restructuring promises made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month.</p><small>2025-08-25 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25135230df0604a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937108/sabalenka-djokovic-win-before-medvedev-tirade-sparks-chaos-at-us-open' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka, Djokovic win before Medvedev tirade sparks chaos at US Open</strong></a><br><p>Aryna Sabalenka and Novak Djokovic overcame early tests to reach the US Open second round before the Grand Slam descended into chaos late on Sunday when Daniil Medvedev launched a tirade at the match umpire and fans disrupted his opponent’s service game.
New York’s famously rowdy fans caused a six-minute delay by refusing to stop jeering and booing midway through Medvedev’s 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 defeat by Benjamin Bonzi on Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The controversy began when a photographer entered the court prematurely after Bonzi missed his first serve on match point at 5-4 in the third set, prompting chair umpire Greg Allensworth to award the Frenchman another first serve for the disturbance.
An incensed Medvedev exploded at the official and whipped up the crowd, preventing a rattled Bonzi from serving.

Medvedev, the 2021 champion at Flushing Meadows, fought off the match point and took the set in a tie break before bageling Bonzi in the fourth to set up a decider.
It was not to be his day, however, as Bonzi composed himself to secure a dramatic win.
“The energy was wild. Thanks to all the ones booing. Thanks for the energy in the fifth,” the Frenchman said.
“It was crazy match point in the third. A crazy scenario. I was exhausted in the fourth set. I gave what I had in the final set. That’s a crazy win.”
 






Sunday start
Under the tournament’s new extended 15-day format, first-round singles action is being contested from Sunday to Tuesday rather than over two days as in previous years, spreading out the star attractions and allowing access for another 70,000-odd spectators.
World number one Sabalenka was among the marquee names on the opening day’s schedule and the Belarusian fed off the vocal Arthur Ashe crowd to overcome determined Swiss Rebeka Masarova 7-5 6-1.
“I didn’t choose to play on Sunday, but if you win the match, it feels great. You have an extra day off, which can be good and bad. I’ve got used to it. I like it,” Sabalenka said.
“But it only works when you win the match. Imagine if you finish the tournament on Sunday. Then you can be a little bit frustrated with the scheduling.”
Novak Djokovic has had plenty of time to recuperate after his run to the Wimbledon semi-finals but the Serb needed to find an extra gear to battle past Learner Tien 6-1 7-6(3) 6-2 as he launched his latest bid for a record 25th major title.
Victory in draining conditions under the lights made Djokovic the first player since the sport turned professional in 1968 to win 75 straight opening-round matches at Grand Slams.
Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton enjoyed more straightforward wins.
Last year’s finalist Fritz beat compatriot Emilio Nava 7-5 6-2 6-3 while 2023 semi-finalist Ben Shelton eased past Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse 6-3 6-2 6-4.
Fourth seed Fritz and sixth seed Shelton have emerged as two of the brightest hopes to end a 22-year U.S. men’s drought at their home major, as their women’s counterparts have long carried the torch for American tennis.
Different feel
Emma Raducanu, the first qualifier to win the tournament four years ago, moved into the second round for the first time since hoisting the trophy when the Briton beat Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1 6-2.
“I did feel different coming into it this year,” said Raducanu, who lost in the first round in 2022 and 2024.
“I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”
 






Canada’s Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Raducanu in the final four years ago, defeated compatriot Rebecca Marino 6-2 6-1 while 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova saw off Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3 7-6(3).
Former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko made smooth progress with a 6-4 6-3 win over Chinese qualifier Wang Xiyu before last year’s New York runner-up Jessica Pegula got past Mayar Sherif 6-0 6-4.
There were a handful of surprises, as qualifier Janice Tjen earned Indonesia’s first victory in a Grand Slam main draw in 22 years when she knocked out 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4 4-6 6-4 to book a match-up with Raducanu.
Alexandra Eala of the Philippines got the crowd on their feet as she battled back from 1-5 in the deciding set to defeat Denmark’s 14th seed Clara Tauson 6-3 2-6 7-6(11) at the Grandstand.

Torrential rains on August 19 had flooded neighbourhoods, severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, left people stranded on roads for hours, disrupted industrial operations and led to prolonged power outages.
Thoroughfares are still riddled with potholes, exposing the devastation of Karachi’s road network and posing serious dangers to commuters across the metropolis.
 
 

Subsequently, as Karachiites left their homes for offices and schools this morning, they faced hurdles caused by accumulated rainwater and “development work” being carried out to repair the ruined roads, as reported by the traffic police.
Areas in the Malir, East and Korangi districts were affected, with locations including the busy thoroughfare of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road near Shaheen Complex.
Dawn.com staffers also reported traffic congestion near Shaheen Complex and on Sharea Faisal at around 10am.
To avoid hassle and inconvenience, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) urged commuters to call the 1915 helpline for alternative routes.
At around 12pm, Google Maps showed most main arteries as having light traffic flow. However, multiple road blockages were reported across the city, notably in locations where roads had been inundated due to rainwater.
 

This Google Maps screengrab shows traffic flow across Karachi at around 12pm on Aug 25, 2025.

Following the recent heavy downpour, roads located within the territorial jurisdictions of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, cantonment boards, Karachi Development Authority, various town municipal corporations and other land-controlling agencies are in damaged condition.
Vital arteries impacted include both tracks of Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, University Road, S.M. Taufiq Road, Jahangir Road, Manghopir Road, Shahrah-i-Qaddafi.
Other key arteries, including M.A. Jinnah and I.I. Chundrigar Road, also have cracks.
On the stretch adjacent to Burns Garden on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, rains have created a deep crater, raising questions about the authorities’ ability to maintain some of the busiest and most vital thoroughfares of the metropolis.
In an update at 7:37am, the traffic police said “development work on potholes” was being done on the second track of Natha Khan Bridge going towards the airport.
However, the statement said there was “no traffic problem” as vehicles passed through the sides.
 






In the Malir district, Madras Chowk heading to Sachal Goth and Muhammad Khan Goth and on Suparco Road, was blocked for traffic at 8:43am as “drain development work” was underway.
“Traffic is being diverted to other roads on both sides. Due to both roads being blocked, there’s traffic pressure at Madras Chowk,” the KTP said.
 






For similar work, both roads in front of Huma Lawn near Shaheen Chowk on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed were also closed for traffic at around 9am.
Commuters were being diverted towards Jang Press from Shaheen Complex and from S.M. Law College as well.
 






At the same time, slow traffic flow was reported at Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Johar as developmental work was being carried out on the underpass.
 






Another point impacted by accumulated rainwater and potholes was Checkpost No. 6 towards Tank Chowk near Malir Cantonment. The traffic police said it was managing the “slow” traffic flow.
 






Slow traffic flow was also reported at the main Superhighway in front of Sachal Mor before the Punjab Adda bus stand. The Frontier Works Organisation was carrying out cleaning on the first track, the KTP said.
 






Rainwater accumulation and potholes also caused traffic delays on Kashif Shaheed Chowk going towards Jamali Bridge on Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi Road at 9:18am, as vehicles were moving via a single track.
 






Bagh-i-Korangi Road from Awami Cut to Mazaar Cut was closed for traffic at 9:20am due to damage and flooding. “Traffic is being diverted to another road with double traffic,” the police said.
 






At 10:35am, traffic was moving at a slow speed on EBM Causeway heading towards Baloch Colony and Brookes Chowrangi, with KTP citing rainwater accumulation and potholes on the road as the reasons.
 






Slow traffic was also witnessed at Drigh Road Underpass, which had been closed for traffic due to rainwater last week, at 11:33am as Karachi Cantonment Board was doing drainage work.

The move came over a month after the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the World Bank teams conducted the 12th and final mission to review and evaluate progress against the targets set under the Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project.
“The World Bank has approved a US$47.9 million grant, funded by the Global Partnership for Education Fund, to help improve girls’ and boys’ participation at pre-primary and primary levels in Pakistan’s Punjab province,” the organisation said in a press release dated August 23, shared on social media today.
According to the press release, the GRADES-Balochistan project will also improve the responsiveness of the education sector to climate change and emergencies.
Among the four million children that the project aims to benefit are 80,000 out-of-school children, over 3m in School Education Department (SED) schools, 850,000 in the non-formal sector, and 140,000 differently-abled children in Special Education Department (SpED) schools, it said.
The World Bank added that over 100,000 teachers and school leaders, as well as parents and community members, would benefit through professional development and awareness campaigns.
“The project is aligned with the Government of Punjab’s broader education reform agenda, which seeks to create a more effective, accountable, and inclusive education system,” said Izza Farrakh, World Bank Task Team Leader for the project, according to the release. “It will do so by supporting the government’s efforts to improve governance, management, and capacity in the education sector.“
Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, called the project a “crucial step towards addressing learning poverty and ensuring equitable access to quality education across Punjab”.
The statement added that the project targeted those populations that were most vulnerable, in line with the group’s goals of eliminating extreme poverty and the promotion of “shared prosperity” and its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Pakistan.
It highlighted that Pakistan had been a member of the World Bank since 1950 and that since this time, the World Bank had provided over $48.3bn to the country in assistance.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, had invested approximately $13bn in Pakistan since 1956, it added. The projects it funded supported renewable energy, financial inclusion, infrastructure, healthcare and agribusiness, among others.
The current portfolio has 54 projects and a total commitment of $15.7bn.
In June, the World Bank had ap­­proved $100m for the “Getting Results: Access and Delivery of Quality Education Services in Balochistan” (GRADES-Balochistan) project, which aimed to benefit around 250,000 students by increasing enrolment and improving literacy.</p><small>2025-08-25 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/151459037c464d2.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930661/why-pakistani-students-feel-unheard-and-what-can-change-that' target='_blank'><strong>Why Pakistani students feel unheard — and what can change that</strong></a><br><p>Across Pakistan’s higher education landscape, an underexplored challenge is quietly taking root: the growing disconnect between university administrations and their students.
Universities in Pakistan have made commendable strides in expanding access and infrastructure. Yet, between those who run these institutions and those who fill their classrooms, an invisible gap persists — one of dialogue, and mediation, subtle enough to escape daily notice, but powerful enough to shape policy, campus culture, and the student experience itself.
In recent years, Pakistan’s student population has surged. Enrolment in higher education crossed 2 million in 2022-23, up from 1.58 million in 2017-18, according to the Higher Education Commission (HEC). With this growth has come greater diversity not only in socioeconomic backgrounds, but in expectations, communication styles, and cultural references.
Many university administrations, however, remain rooted in older institutional traditions, shaped by administrative norms that were designed for smaller, more homogeneous cohorts. As the social, digital, and cultural profile of Pakistani youth evolves, so too must the ways universities connect, communicate, and collaborate with their students.
 
 

Autonomy and governance
One of the central structural issues is the lack of formal mediation bodies or consistent platforms for dialogue. Without these, students are left to navigate opaque decision-making processes on their own, while administrators handle policy and discipline without structured feedback. This results in a mutual sense of disconnect — students feel unheard, and institutions operate in the dark, unable to anticipate or fully grasp the concerns of the very people they serve.
Unlike in many other countries, Pakistani universities are governed by individual institutional charters. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) sets minimum academic and administrative standards but grants universities considerable autonomy in how they govern themselves.
Under the HEC’s 2002 Ordinance, degree-awarding institutions are authorised to craft their own statutes, including rules on governance, student conduct, and disciplinary proceedings. While this autonomy encourages innovation and accountability, it also creates inconsistencies in how student affairs are handled. Some universities have clear grievance redressal policies; others lack accessible processes or dedicated forums for dialogue. As a result, the quality of governance often depends entirely on internal policy choices.
The legal vacuum in student representation
Adding to this complexity is the legal status of student representation. Since the 1984 ban on student unions, formal avenues for student voices have been limited. While the ban may have contributed to greater campus stability at the time, its long-term effect has been the absence of structured, representative dialogue between students and university leadership.
In March 2024, the Supreme Court, in Judgment No. 7 of 2024, acknowledged the importance of student representation in university governance and called for clearer regulatory frameworks to safeguard against politicisation. The ruling has reignited policy debates but has not addressed the broader challenge of how universities can integrate student perspectives through neutral, accountable mechanisms. In their absence, students often resort to social media or informal channels to voice grievances — a practice that can further widen the trust gap between administrations and the student body.
This policy vacuum is especially concerning in a sector where unmanaged tensions can escalate rapidly. A 2022 study by the Institute of Social and Policy Sciences (I-SAPS) found that over 70 per cent of students in public-sector universities felt they lacked adequate platforms to raise concerns about academic policies, housing conditions, or campus life. In private universities, student satisfaction was generally higher, yet the perception of having limited influence over policy decisions remained a recurrent theme.
 
 

Comparative legal models
International models offer useful points of reference. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the Education Act 1994 requires universities to engage students through formally recognised student unions and academic representation systems. In the United States, many institutions maintain Ombuds offices — neutral, confidential spaces where students can raise concerns and seek mediation. These bodies are neither adversarial nor political; their sole mandate is to preserve institutional harmony by ensuring students are heard and administrators remain informed.
In Pakistan, by contrast, such institutional forums are rare. While a few private universities have experimented with town hall meetings, feedback portals, and faculty–student liaison committees, these initiatives are often ad hoc and lack legal recognition. As student populations grow and digital communication accelerates the flow of information, informal mechanisms alone are unlikely to suffice. Universities must now consider whether structured, legally backed forums for mediation can complement governance structures and build trust without undermining institutional authority.
The benefits of such mechanisms go beyond procedure. When students feel heard, they are more inclined to follow institutional policies, engage in academic initiatives, and contribute to a healthier campus culture. Likewise, administrators with access to real-time student feedback can make better-informed decisions, reducing the risk of resistance, misunderstandings, or policy missteps.
Legally, there is room to explore this middle ground. Section 10 of the HEC’s Model Charter for Private Universities encourages the creation of academic councils with student representation, albeit limited to academic matters. Extending this principle into wider aspects of campus life — without even reverting to politicised structures — could be a useful starting point. Similarly, grievance redressal systems under the HEC’s Quality Assurance Framework could be expanded to include student mediation cells, with representation from both students and faculty.
Risks of ignoring the mediation gap
Today, universities grapple with a host of challenges — from regulatory compliance to financial sustainability. Yet neglecting student–administration relations risks brewing long-term tensions that could erode institutional cohesion.
As Pakistan’s higher education sector seeks to compete globally and serve a younger, more connected generation, the lack of structured mediation mechanisms is poised to become an ever greater governance liability.
Furthermore, unresolved grievances can invite litigation under constitutional provisions on equality (Article 25) or due process (Article 10-A), especially when disciplinary actions are perceived as arbitrary. If grievance management continues to be inconsistent and opaque, it could potentially undermine public confidence in higher education governance.
 
 

It is important to clarify that the case for mediation is not a critique of existing governance structures, many of which have adapted to manage complex academic ecosystems with limited resources. Rather, it is an acknowledgment of the changing nature of student engagement, and the growing need for responsive institutional frameworks that reflect this shift.
Building such systems does not require sweeping legislation or major structural change. It simply requires recognising that, when thoughtfully institutionalised, dialogue can be a source of stability, not disruption. Universities that anticipate and manage student expectations through transparent, participatory forums are far better positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex educational environment.
In a country where education is both a constitutional right and a cornerstone of national progress, fostering genuine partnership between students and universities is a legal and strategic necessity. Ensuring they work in concert, rather than in conflict, may prove to be one of the most vital reforms yet to shape the future of Pakistan’s higher education.

The Indian government has been considering projects since the early 2000s to control the flow of water from Tibet’s Angsi Glacier, which sustains more than 100 million people downstream in China, India and Bangladesh.
But the plans have been hindered by fierce and occasionally violent resistance from residents of the border state of Arunachal Pradesh, who fear their villages will be submerged and way of life destroyed by any dam.
Then in December, China announced that it would build the world’s largest hydropower dam in a border county just before the Yarlung Zangbo river crosses into India.
That triggered fears in New Delhi that its longtime strategic rival — which has some territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh — could weaponise its control of the river, which originates in the Angsi Glacier and is known as the Siang and Brahmaputra in India.
India’s largest hydropower company in May moved survey materials under armed police protection near a prospective site of the Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam, which would be the country’s biggest dam, if completed.
Senior Indian officials have also been holding meetings about accelerating construction this year, including one organised in July by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.
Delhi’s concerns were described in the undated Indian government analysis of the Chinese dam’s impact, the specifics of which Reuters corroborated with four sources and is reporting for the first time.
Beijing hasn’t released detailed plans about the dam’s construction, but the analysis drew on past work conducted by Indian government-affiliated institutions like the Central Water Commission and accounted for the expected size of the Chinese project, which broke ground in July and will cost nearly $170 billion.
Delhi estimates the Chinese dam will allow Beijing to divert as much as 40 billion cubic meters of water, or just over a third of what is received annually at a key border point, according to the sources and the document.
The impact would be especially acute in the non-monsoon months, when temperatures rise and lands become barren across swathes of India.
The Upper Siang project would alleviate that with its projected 14 BCM of storage capacity, allowing India to release water during the dry season. That could mean the major regional city of Guwahati, which is dependent on water-intensive industry and farming, would see a reduction in supply of 11pc, according to the sources and the document, as opposed to 25pc if the Indian dam isn’t built.
The project could also mitigate any move by Beijing to release devastating torrents of water downstream, the sources said.
If the dam is at its minimum drawdown level — where water is stored at less than 50pc of its height — it would be able to fully absorb any excess water released from a breach in Chinese infrastructure, according to the document and the sources.
India is considering a proposal to keep 30pc of its dam empty at any time in order to account for unexpected surges, two of the sources said.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that the hydropower projects “have undergone rigorous scientific research on safety and environmental protection, and will not adversely impact the water resources, ecology, or geology of downstream countries.”
“China has always maintained a responsible attitude toward the development and utilisation of transboundary rivers, and has maintained long-term communication and cooperation with downstream countries such as India and Bangladesh,” the spokesperson added.
Modi’s office and the Indian ministries responsible for water and external affairs did not respond to Reuters’ questions. State-owned hydropower major NHPC also did not return a request for comment.
India’s foreign ministry has said that top diplomat S. Jaishankar raised concerns about the dam during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on August 18. A Jaishankar deputy also told lawmakers in August that the government was implementing measures to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of citizens in downstream areas, including building the dam.
India has itself been accused by Pakistan, a Chinese ally that it briefly clashed with in May, of weaponising water. Delhi this year suspended its participation in a 1960 water-sharing treaty with Islamabad and is considering diverting flows from another crucial river away from its downstream neighbour.
An international tribunal has ruled that India must adhere to the agreement but Delhi says the panel lacks jurisdiction.
 

India aims to construct a dam in its northeast to mitigate the potential impacts of a massive dam being built across the border in China.

Development or destruction?
When NHPC workers moved surveying materials near the village of Parong in May, angry locals damaged their machinery, destroyed a nearby bridge and looted the tents of police sent to guard the operation.
Many of them are members of Arunachal’s Adi community, who live off paddy, orange and sweet lime farms in the mist-shrouded hills and valleys nourished by the Siang.
The villagers have set up makeshift watch posts on regional roads to deny access to NHPC workers. That has forced security personnel to trek miles, often under the cover of night, to reach a prospective site of the dam.
At least 16 Adi villages are likely to be lost to the storage area of the dam, directly affecting an estimated 10,000 people, according to two of the sources.
Community leaders say more than 100,000 people will be impacted overall.
“The cardamom, paddy, jackfruit and pear we grow on this land help educate our children and support our family,” said Odoni Palo Pabin, an Adi grocer and mother of two. “We will fight the dam to death.”
The dam has the support of Arunachal’s chief minister, who is a member of Modi’s party and has called the Chinese project an existential threat.
The project will “ensure water security and provide flood moderation to counter any potential water surges,” the state government said in a statement, adding that it decided in June to engage in detailed compensation discussions with families that could be affected by the dam.
Lawmaker Alo Libang, an Adi who represents an area that would be submerged by the Indian project, said he believed locals could be convinced to move if they received generous compensation.
NHPC has plans to spend more than $3 million on education and emergency infrastructure to incentivise the villagers to move elsewhere, three of the sources said, citing instructions from Modi’s office.
In one sign of progress, three villages in the area recently agreed to let NHPC officials carry out dam-related work, according to the Arunachal government and dozens of locals.
India has a history of activist movements against large dams, which have sometimes slowed these projects by years or forced them to scale down.
Even if the Upper Siang dam gets the go-ahead, it could take a decade to build after breaking ground, according to four of the sources.
That means the project would likely be completed after China’s project, which Beijing expects to start generating power by the early-to-mid 2030s.
The delay means an Indian project would be vulnerable during construction if Beijing suddenly releases water during the monsoon season, triggering a surge that could wash away temporary dams, two of the sources said.
International experts and Adi activists have also warned that building large dams in seismically active Tibet and Arunachal could heighten risks for downstream communities.
The Chinese “dam is being built in a zone of high seismicity and in a zone that experiences extreme weather events,” said Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.
“These kinds of extreme weather events trigger landslides, mudslides, glacial lake outburst flooding,” he said. “So that raises concerns about dam safety… it’s a very legitimate concern, and India should engage with China.”</p><small>2025-08-25 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2507574086bceb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936966/centre-kp-seem-to-be-on-same-page-on-nfc-tweaks' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, KP seem to be on ‘same page’ on NFC tweaks</strong></a><br><p>• First meeting of 11th NFC scheduled for Friday
• PTI’s Muzammil Aslam says KP will seek disincentivising  population, propose prosperity and forestation as criteria for  resource distribution
• KP minister rues imbalance in Centre’s approach to smaller provinces
NATHIA GALI: For a change, the federal government led by the PML-N and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government headed by the PTI seem to be in agreement on changes to the oversized population factor in determining the share of the federation and its federating units under the new National Finance Commission (NFC), set to hold its introductory meeting later this week.
“We will demand that population and backwardness should be disincentivised for resource distribution among the provinces,” said KP Mini­ster for Finance Muzammil Aslam while speaking at the first two-day ‘Prosper Pakistan’ conference organised by the FPCCI Regional Office Peshawar in collaboration with KP’s Board of Investment and Trade.
 


The federal ministers, particularly development minister Ahsan Iqbal, had been publicly calling for disincentivising the population for NFC shares, although no political party in any province has ever called for the population to secure more funds from the divisible pool. However, the allegations of irregularities in the population census have cropped up in the past, which required improvement in census methodologies. The first meeting of the 11th NFC, constituted last week, has been scheduled for August 29 (Friday) to set the stage for subsequent deliberations.
The apparent converging stance of the two arch rivals — the PML-N and the PTI — is likely to put the two larger provinces, Punjab and Sindh, under immense pressure for disincentivising population as the key determinant for the distribution of divisible pool resources. The revision, however, also benefits Balochistan, the sparsely populated largest province by area.
 
 

Led by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the political partners at the Centre and backed by the relevant quarters, it would be very challenging for junior leaderships of the ruling parties in Sindh and Punjab to resist reducing the importance of population to work out vertical shares of the federation and its federation units and then decide horizontal shares of the provinces.
Mr Muzammil said the KP government would demand changes in the formula of the horizontal resource distribution within the federating units during the upcoming NFC deliberations. He said 82pc resource distribution among the provinces was based on the population criterion and 10.6pc on the basis of backwardness, but the KP government would now stipulate reduction in population, prosperity, and forestation as criteria for the distribution of resources.
He said the new NFC had been constituted to evolve a consensus on the vertical and horizontal distribution of financial resources. The provinces currently receive 57.5pc share under the vertical formula, while the remaining amount goes to the federal government. He said the KP would demand changes in the criteria for the horizontal distribution as well.
‘Imbalance in development approach’
KP’s finance minister, who hails from Karachi, criticised the federal government, saying the National Highway Authority (NHA) was used for the road and highway projects in Punjab and Sindh, but it ignored the KP and Balochistan.
“This imbalance in the development approach has aggravated the situation in the smaller provinces”, while the planning minister Ahsan Iqbal was talking about the collapse of the federal government in five years due to its financial constraints as the development budgets of Sindh and Punjab exceeded that of the Centre.
 
 

He told the participants that 12 hydropower projects were currently under construction in KP capable of producing 1,000MW at an estimated supply cost of 8 US cents per unit. However, he said the government had increased the wheeling charges to Rs27 per unit that would block cheaper electricity from the province.
He regretted that the Left Bank Canal could not be constructed in more than three decades since the water apportionment accord was signed in 1991.
Under the 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 and still in force after 15 years instead of a five-year constitutional term, the provincial share had increased to 57.5pc from about 47pc which further increased to about 59pc given special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh on different grounds and reduced the federal share to 42.5pc.
 
 

In subsequent years, the Centre imposed a petroleum levy (about Rs1.5 trillion) on petroleum products and secured about Rs1.5tr cash balances from the provinces on an annual basis, effectively reversing the financial balance to its favour. The Centre, however, has been advocating disincentivising the population factor and provincial shares to common responsibilities like dams, natural disasters, climate change and national security etc.

Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament from Sept 30 to November 2. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
The women’s national selection committee named the squad for the tournament, and announced that the same squad will also feature in a three-match ODI series against South Africa, scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from Sept 16-22.
 






“Uncapped right-handed batter Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland, is part of the ODI squad,” PCB said.
“Fatima Sana, who represented Pakistan in the previous edition of ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, will lead the side for the first time in the mega event,” it added.
The 23-year-old had previously captained the side in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier held in Lahore this year, where the team maintained a 100 per cent win record to secure qualification for this year’s ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup set to take place in India and Sri Lanka, the statement added.
 
 

Six players are set to feature in their maiden ODI World Cup, namely: Natalia Parvaiz (8 ODIs, 24T20Is), Rameen Shamim (8 ODIs, 11 T20Is), Sadaf Shamas (15 ODIs, 12 T20Is), Sadia Iqbal (27 ODIs, 50 T20Is), Shawaal Zulfiqar (3 ODIs, 9 T20Is) and Syeda Aroob Shah (2 ODIs, 15 T20Is).
Moreover, 21-year-old Aroob, 20-year-old Shawaal alongside 20-year-old Eyman featured for Pakistan in the inaugural edition of ICC Women’s U19 T20 World Cup held in South Africa in January 2023.
“Additionally, two changes have been made from the 15-member squad that featured in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier,” PCB said.
“Eyman and Sadaf come into the squad in place of Gull Feroza and Najiha Alvi, who have been named in the five-member non-travelling reserves alongside Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.”
The 15 players alongside five reserves players will take part in a 14-day pre-South Africa series camp from August 29. “The players under the coaching staff led by Muhammad Wasim will undergo practice sessions as well as 50-over practice matches.”
South Africa women’s cricket team will arrive in Lahore on Sept 12.
Pakistan became the fourth side to announce their squad after Bangladesh, England and India announced their squads earlier this month.
15-member squad:
Fatima Sana (captain), Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (vice-captain), Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Eyman Fatima, Nashra Sundhu, Natalia Parvaiz, Omaima Sohail, Rameen Shamim, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Shawaal Zulfiqar, Sidra Amin, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper) and Syeda Aroob Shah.
Non-traveling reserves:
Gull Feroza, Najiha Alvi, Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.
Player support personnel:
Hina Munawar (manager), Muhammad Wasim (head coach), Junaid Khan (assistant coach bowling), Tahir Khan (assistant coach bowling), Abdul Saad (fielding coach), Muhammad Rafi Ullah (media manager), Muhammad Asfand Yar (strength and conditioning coach), Waleed Ahmed (analyst), Tehreem Sumbal (physiotherapist), Kiran Shahzadi (masseuse) and team doctor (tbc).

• This is not a political matter and we will address it through legal means, says elder brother
KARACHI: Chanesar Town chairman Farhan Ghani, younger brother of senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader and local government minister Saeed Ghani, was booked, arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal.
Police got one-day remand of Farhan from a duty magistrate on Sunday. He will be produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday (today).
In a statement, Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of the PPP Karachi division, said that a dispute occurred on Sharea Faisal within the remit of the Chanesar Town and a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against his brother Farhan and some others. “Soon after, Farhan and his associates voluntarily surrendered themselves to the authorities.
“This is a legal matter, not a political one, and we will address it through legal means,” the elder Ghani said.
Earlier, the Ferozabad police registered a case under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (theft), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Without identifying his department, complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon told the police that he is a “government employee” and was supervising fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal on Aug 22.
He stated at around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons, including Chanesar Town chairman Farhan, in three vehicles arrived there and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal. He said he told them that he had all permissions but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said when he insisted that he had all required no-objection certificates, they started using smear language and beating him.
He said they dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him. In the meantime, a police team arrived there, rescued him and took him to the police station where he lodged the FIR.
On Sunday, the investigating officer (IO) produced three suspects, including Mr Farhan, before Judicial Magistrate (East) Waseem Abbas and sought their one-day police custody.
The IO informed the court that the suspects had been arrested on terrorism charges and their custody was required to apprehend their remaining accomplices with their help and to check their criminal record.
He further submitted that since the case was registered under terrorism charges and ATCs remained closed on Sunday, he was seeking their one-day custody to produce them before the concerned anti-terrorism court for remand.
After hearing the IO, the duty magistrate granted one-day physical custody of the suspects and directed him to produce them before the administrative judge of the ATCs on Monday (today).

He was identified as Rashid and his brother Wajid had already died of severe torture marks at the spot.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in Raiwind area two days back.
They were lying in a pool of blood and the suspected attackers holding clubs in hands were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around.
According to the video clip, no one from the passersby tried to rescue the two young men when they were being tortured by the attackers.
There were reports that the police traced and arrested two of the suspected attackers after lodging a case against them.
A police official said Wajid and Rashid had argued with a street vendor over the price of the fruit.  
He said the minor issue later led to the heated debate and then physical attack by the suspects.

The party contends that the video being relied on pertains to its Kahna public meeting, held on Sept 21, 2024.
Shahrez Khan was “arrested” from his home, when he was preparing to go abroad to participate in an athletic international championship on Thursday (Aug 21) after men in plainclothes barged into his home on the Canal Road.
The next day, his younger brother Shershah was also arrested from outside his house. Both are on police remand.
In a video posted to state broadcaster PTV News’ official X handle, a series of clips are shown wherein Shahrez can be seen walking alongside his mother Aleema Khan, as well as PTI’s Khadija Shah, Shayan Bashir and some others.
 






In the caption of the clip, it is claimed that both Shahrez and Shershah were arrested over their involvement in the attack on the Lahore corps commander’s residence on May 9, 2023.
However, PTI’s Shayan Bashir stated the video clip in question was from the party’s public meeting in Lahore’s Kahna area, for which the party had obtained an NOC.
 






He said Shahrez, owing to non-availability of a driver, had driven his mother to the public meeting. He claimed that since police had stopped party leaders’ vehicles some five kilometres from the venue, they could be seen walking to reach the venue.
Mr Bashir claimed he had met Shahrez at a police station in Lahore Cantt and reported that “he was OK”.

Following the recent heavy monsoon rains, “significant erosion and damage” have been reported in the Hub Canal within the jurisdiction of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), said a statement issued by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
According to KWSC officials, the recent damage to the Hub Canal did not occur in the old or new Hub Canal. Instead, the damage took place in an eight-kilometre stretch that falls under the jurisdiction of Wapda.
They said that the section is managed entirely by Wapda, and after this stretch, the canal connects to the section overseen by the KWSC. The point where the canal transitions from Wapda to KWSC control is known as the “Zero Point,” they said.
In an urgent move to prevent further destruction, the statement said that Wapda has drastically reduced the flow from the dam, sending shockwaves across the city’s water distribution system.

KWSC says city receives only 40 MGD instead of 100 MGD from Hub Dam

“Karachi is currently receiving only 40 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Hub Dam, down from the usual 100 MGD,” the KWSC statement confirmed while quoting the chief engineer of bulk.
This sharp drop in supply is already being felt across the western, central, and Keamari districts, where taps have started to run dry. Residents are bracing for extended hours without water as the city struggles to cope.
Although the emergency repair work was expected to be completed by 4pm on Sunday, the water supply is unlikely to return to normal immediately.
“The repairs are expected to take until 4pm on Sunday, though it takes around 12 hours for water to travel from the dam to the Hub Pumping Station,” said the KWSC statement, confirming delays to any immediate relief while urging the public to act responsibly.
“We apologise for the inconvenience and urge citizens to use water sparingly. All available resources are being deployed to expedite the restoration process,” said the KWSC chief engineer.
MQM-P pins blame on Sindh govt, KWSC
As the city reels under the water shortage due to emergency repairs at the Hub Canal, political tempers have flared. Senior MQM-Pakistan leader and Member of the National Assembly, Syed Aminul Haque, launched a scathing attack on the Sindh government and KWSC, accusing them of “criminal negligence” and “systemic corruption” that has left citizens “thirsting for every drop.”
In a strongly worded statement, Mr Haque alleged that despite the much-publicised 100 MGD Hub Canal water supply project, the water board has failed to deliver water to large swathes of the city.
 
 

“The people in Orangi Town, Surjani Town, Baldia Town, Keamari, Korangi, Landhi, North Karachi, Malir, and Shah Faisal Colony are struggling without water,” he said.
He further accused the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Sindh government of growing mismanagement.
“Their incompetence has written a new chapter of urban failure. Even after the recent rains, areas like Orangi remain submerged in sewage water,” he said.
The MQM leader also criticised Jamaat-i-Islami, saying their role has been limited to slogans without action.
“Drainage and sanitation projects exist only on paper. Central Karachi and other districts flood every time it rains,” he added.
The MQM-P leader demanded immediate, practical solutions and accountability.
“People pay taxes, but receive garbage, sewage, and broken promises in return. Karachi needs action, not speeches,” he said.

An official told the BBC that the man “has been arrested for perjury”.
In early July, the middle-aged man had lodged a police complaint and appe­ared before a magistrate to record his statement.
His identity has been withheld and, so far, he has appeared in public dressed fully in black, including a hood and a face mask. In the police complaint, the man claimed he worked as a cleaner at the temple from 1995 to 2014 — and alleged that he had been forced to bury the bodies of hundreds of girls and young women who were brutally raped and murdered.
He narrated five alleged incidents where he gave specifics, and said there were many others. Some of the victims, the man alleged, were minors.
He said he had been in hiding since 2014 and had returned and spoken up to silence his nagging conscience.
The man did not name anyone, but blamed the “temple administration and its staff” — allegations the temple chief rejected as “false and baseless”.
A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family.
Karnataka’s interior min­­ister Gangadharaiah Parameshwara told the state assembly last week that the protection was in place. The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karn­ataka government later recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe.

According to a provisional schedule shared by UN officials, Pakistan may have a strategic advantage of speaking after India, giving it a direct platform to respond to New Delhi’s narrative.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level Pakistani delegation, which will include Deputy Prime Mini­ster Ishaq Dar, as well as the PM’s adviser on foreign affairs, Tariq Fatemi.
 
 

The 80th UNGA officially opens on Sept 9, with the high-level general debate running from Sept 23 to 29.
Brazil will speak first, followed by the US, where President Trump will deliver his first address to the UNGA in his second term.
This year’s theme is: ‘Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.’
According to the provisional list, India’s premier will speak in the morning, while Pakistan’s leader, along with the heads of Israel, China, and Bangladesh, is scheduled for later that day. Officials in New Delhi have indicated that their prime minister will also participate in the general debate.
Observers note that the back-to-back appearances of PM Shehbaz and Modi will underline the gulf in perspectives. While India is expected to stress sovereignty and security, Pakistan will be able to respond directly, emphasising Kashmir and regional peace as core issues.
A senior Pakistani diplomat said: “The world has seen how quickly South Asia can slide toward conflict. Without a just settlement of Kashmir, the UN’s own pro­mise of peace, development, and human rights cannot be fulfilled in our region.”
The 80th UNGA promises to be one of the busiest diplomatic seasons in years, taking place amid the Israel’s war on Gaza, the Ukraine conflict, and the lingering aftereffects of the May India-Pakistan war. For Islamabad, the message is clear: the world cannot ignore South Asia’s flashpoints, and Kashmir remains the key to lasting peace.
According to the provisional schedule, a special event on climate will be held on Sept 24, while a high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will be held on Sept 26.

PESHAWAR: At least 13 people were killed and 52 others injured in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours lashed several districts of Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa over the weekend.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the death toll from floods and rains in the province has risen to 409 since Aug 15, with 251 people injured.
The PDMA report said the victims included 305 men, 55 women and 49 children. Among the injured were 183 men, 38 women and 30 children. Rains and floods have also destroyed 578 houses and partially damaged 2,954 across the province.
In Dera Ismail Khan, eight people were killed and 48 were injured after torrential rains and strong winds wreaked havoc on Saturday night. Three children lost their lives in Lower Dir when a house collapsed, while one fatality was reported in Mardan and another in Upper Kohistan.
A severe rainstorm caused widespread damage, crippling the power supply and destroying homes, solar panels and public infrastructure. Wind speeds reached up to 100 km/h, uprooting trees, toppling poles and collapsing walls and roofs. The district plunged into darkness after feeders tripped and the power system collapsed.
Officials confirmed that five of the deceased belonged to Dera tehsil and three to Paharpur tehsil. In Maryali, a wall of Jamiatul Madina collapsed, destroying a solar plant but causing no casualties.
Hospitals declared emergencies to treat the injured, while Dera Commissioner Zafarul Islam Khattak urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel during stormy weather. He directed that all available resources be deployed to provide medical assistance.
Punjab on high alert
The Punjab government is on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to swell rivers across the province. An official flood alert from India reported a “high flood”  level in the Tawi River at Jammu on Aug 24, prompting emergency measures  downstream.
 
 

Secretary of the Department of Emergency Services Dr  Rizwan Naseer made an emergency visit to Sialkot to inspect flood defences at the Head Marala Barrage and the Marala Flood Control Room.  Rescue operations are underway, with more than 21,000 people already evacuated from vulnerable areas.
The Chenab River basin is a particular point of concern, with key sites like Marala, Khanki, and  Qadirabad showing significant inflows. While these locations are currently within normal limits, the rising inflows at Khanki and the substantial water volumes pose a latent threat for the next 48 hours.
High flood at Indus, Chenab
Meanwhile, the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) warned on Sunday that the Chenab and Indus rivers are likely to reach high flood levels within 24 hours, while the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala will remain in high flood for the next few days, subject to water releases from India.
Flash floods are expected in the nullahs of Dera Ghazi Khan and northeastern Balochistan, while medium to high flows are predicted in nullahs linked to the Ravi and Chenab. Urban flooding is forecast for Lahore, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi in the next two days.
Heavy rainfall is expected in upper Punjab, particularly over the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum catchments, from Aug 25 to 27. The Indus River is already in high flood at Guddu and medium flood at Sukkur, while the River Sutlej is in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala.
Water levels at Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs are nearing their maximum conservation limits.
In Vehari district, floodwaters from the Sutlej River worsened after India released water, submerging rural localities. Authorities have established three tent villages in Jam Laira, Farooqabad and Sahooka to house the displaced.
According to an official handout, Deputy Com­mission­er Imrana Tau­qeer said the top priority was shifting affected people to safer locations. So far, 371 residents and 26 cattle have been moved. Seven flooded settlements have been evacuated.
 
 

In Sahiwal and adjacent districts, a medium-level flood along the Sutlej River has displaced more than 1,450 people and 450 livestock in the past 48 hours. Over 40 kilometres of the river belt from Pir Ghani to Irazi Bali Dilawar is underwater.
Rescue teams have deployed dozens of boats and over 100 personnel to evacuate stranded villagers in Pakpattan, Bahawal­na­gar and Okara. Officials warned that water discharge levels at Herikey and Ganda Singh Wala exceeded 126,000 cusecs.
Standing crops across thousands of acres have been destroyed. Locals have demanded urgent medical aid, vaccination for livestock and measures against waterborne diseases.
Former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Ahmad Khan Wattoo urged the government to declare the affected districts as calamity-hit areas. He criticised India’s release of floodwaters and described it as “water terrorism”.
In Narowal, Rescue 1122 evacuated 30 people, including women, after a sudden flood surge in Nala Auj, which merges into the Ravi River at Shakargarh. The surge submerged hundreds of acres of farmland and damaged protective embankments.
Floodwaters also entered homes and livestock enclosures in nearby villages. District officials said Section 144 has been imposed to ban bathing in rivers and drains after three villagers went missing in Nala Dek.
