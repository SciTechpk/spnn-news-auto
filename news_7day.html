“In view of the rich potential of the youth, the emerging economy and the growing confidence of global financial institutions, Pakistan is rapidly gaining a prominent position in the crypto industry,” he said while speaking after the signing ceremony of an agreement between the Pakistan Crypto Council and World Liberty Financial at the Ministry of Finance. 
The agreement aims to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption. It was signed by Chase Hero of World Liberty Financial and CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council Bilal Bin Saeed. On the occasion, Zack Witkoff, Co-Chairman of World Liberty Financial, was also present. 
“Pakistani youth have immense potential which can be utilised to create new employment opportunities; ways are being found to digitise remittances so that both the government and the people can directly benefit,” the minister remarked. 

Crypto Council, World Liberty Financial sign deal to boost blockchain adoption

The minister, while mentioning the opportunities available in Pakistan regarding crypto, said that the establishment of the Crypto Council has brought about a new innovative development in Pakistan and work was underway rapidly on the regulatory framework in the crypto sector. 
Mr Tarar said that World Liberty Financial was a major platform doing significant work in the areas of regulation and stable coins under the decentralised finance protocol. 
He said that this agreement will help in making the crypto regulatory framework in Pakistan stable and effective and the youth will be able to participate fully in this important sector. 
The minister said that 60 per cent of Pakistan’s population was under the age of 30 and its youth have immense potential which can be activated to create new employment opportunities in the country. He said Pakistan has made significant progress in the crypto sector in a very short period of time and today’s cooperation will further expand the opportunities for crypto in Pakistan. 
Mr Tarar, while welcoming the World Liberty Financial delegation to Pakistan, said there are immense opportunities for business and investment in the country. 
On this occasion, Bilal Bin Saqib, who is also finance minister’s adviser, said that through cooperation with international organisations, they were working to make Pakistan an important part of the global digital economy. 
This partnership with World Liberty Financial will play a significant role in the implementation of modern financial technologies in Pakistan, he added. 
Zach Witkoff said Pakistan is a rapidly emerging economy and its youth have the potential to quickly adopt technology. He said there were excellent investment opportunities in the digital finance sector in Pakistan and he wanted the country to play an important role in the global digital economy. 
Mr Witkoff expressed the hope that this partnership will yield positive results in the future.

“Those who dare to attack the integrity of nuclear Pakistan will have to face consequences beyond their imagination,” president of the Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society (PESS) retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum said while talking to reporters at a book launch on Saturday.
He made it clear that Pakistan will not be intimidated by the hollow threats of India.
“In 1965 war, the Indian army, which wanted to occupy the city of Sialkot and have a gala at the Lahore Gymkhana Club, had to face humiliating defeat both at BRB link canal and in Chawinda tank battle,” he recalled.
“Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society like the entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces,” he declared.
Slamming India for attempts to malign Pakistan by unleashing a propaganda against it soon after the incident, he said it was clearly a false-flag operation.
He pointed out that the incident took place as deep as 400 kilometres inside held Kashmir.
Mr Qayyum said the timing of the incident made the entire episode of shooting all the more suspicious as it took place during a visit to India by US Vice President J.D. Vance.
 
 

He criticised India for “unilaterally” suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty which even survived two wars between India and Pakistan.
The former army officer  termed the steps taken by the Modi government following the attack “an attempt to divert world’s attention” from death and destruction in the disputed territory.

These guidelines aim to promote trust, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven financial services while protecting the rights and interests of consumers.
In its Financial Stability Review 2024, the central bank noted that with AI adoption surging across different sectors, the global banking industry is also increasingly embracing these technologies.
 
 

In the case of Pakistan, financial institutions are also embracing AI technology. The most commonly adopted AI technologies by banks include robotics, process automation (for structured operational tasks), virtual assistant (for customer service), and machine learning techniques (for fraud detection and risk management).

SBP survey finds half of regulated entities have adopted AI tools

In 2024, the SBP surveyed 55 regulated entities (REs) to explore the current state, challenges, and future prospects of AI adoption within Pakistan’s financial services sector. The surveyed REs included commercial banks (conventional and Islamic), microfinance banks, digital banks, Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Payment Service Operators/Payment Service Providers (PSOs/PSPs).
The results of the SBP’s survey on using AI in banks reveal that about half of the REs have either deployed AI in financial services or are in the development process.
Moreover, the survey indicates that AI is being used for various financial services, including fraud detection, customer services, marketing, credit risk assessment, process automation, etc. In this context, banks need to take care of the associated risks of AIs and incorporate the carbon footprint of AI into their risk management frameworks, introducing it as a specific risk category.
This requires relevant risk identification, assessment, development and implementation of adequate risk mitigation strategies.
“The foremost step is to recognise the potential environmental risks associated with adopting AI systems,” said the report.
The most commonly used AI technologies in the banking sector are among the most energy-intensive owing to real-time processing and high accuracy requirements.
“After risk identification, banks need to measure the emissions associated with AI models throughout their life cycle,” said the report.
“Banks must implement risk mitigation strategies to contain the environmental impact of their AI systems. The energy-efficient AI models and algorithms could help address climate concerns,” said the report.
Notably, International Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2 also require companies to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities, specifically about climate-related exposures.
“In Pakistan, the adoption of these standards have been proposed in a phased manner, initially starting with listed companies based on certain criteria, such as total assets, turnover and number of employees,” said the report.
It deserves emphasis that banks must define risk appetite and tolerance level of AI’s carbon footprint, the report added. By setting thresholds, banks would ably deploy AI system balancing operational efficiency with environmental concerns, it added.
The report said that a highly important aspect of AI is to assess the systemic risks on financial institutions and their customers. For instance, high technological penetration and supplier concentration could expose financial institutions to losses arising from operational failures, cyber-attacks and supply chain disruptions affecting key vendors. Further, increased use of AI models with similar characteristics could augment asset price vulnerabilities due to increased correlations in financial markets.

In a statement on Saturday, the minister said that despite having a population seven times larger than Pakistan, an expansive landmass and centuries of statehood experience, India continues to suffer from an insecurity syndrome.
In contrast, he added, Pakistan, with just 77 years of statehood and a comparatively smaller geography and population, exhibits greater composure and maturity.
 






Referring to the tragic Jaffar Ex­­press terrorist attack in Balo­chis­tan, Ahsan Iqbal noted that Pakis­tan responded in a responsible and mature manner by acknowledging internal security lapses and committing to addressing them, even while credible evidence pointed towards foreign involvement.
Conversely, he observed, India’s reaction to the Pahalgam tragedy in held Kashmir was impulsive and reactive, and rather than acknowledging its own security shortcomings, it hastily shifted blame onto Pakistan without any substantiated evidence.

PFUJ slams Modi govt for fuelling war-like atmosphere

‘War-like atmosphere’
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has strongly condemned the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for pursuing a policy that fosters a war-like atmosphere in the region and undermines peace and harmony.
In a joint statement, PFUJ Acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari called for an immediate halt to India’s uncalled for decision to suspend relations with Pakistan, particularly in areas such as the Indus Waters Treaty, trade and commerce, over an incident that remains under investigation and appears to be a false flag operation staged in Pahalgam, seemingly for political gains and to stir regional tension.
They pointed out that Pahalgam is located nearly 200km from the LoC and is heavily patrolled by Indian Bor­d­­er Security Force and the army, ma­­king the incident highly suspicious.
The PFUJ leadership warned that hostilities between the two nei­ghbouring countries would only wo­­rsen bilateral relations rather than help bridge the already wide gap — created solely by the policies of India’s BJP-led government, which they said prioritises Hindutva ideology over secularism, a value India has upheld since its independence.
“Investigate the cause of the Pahalgam incident first, instead of blaming Pakistan for your own incompetence,” they added.
The PFUJ leadership also criticised the Indian media for promoting a policy of hate-mongering through the dissemination of false and fake content, a hallmark of Indian media during times of heightened tensions.

• Commissioner says flood wave passes Muzaffarabad without causing damage
LAHORE/MUZ­AFFARABAD: An unusual surge in the water level of River Jhelum — attributed by officials to snowmelt but feared by locals as flash floods released by India after suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — has triggered panic among the residents of Muzaffarabad and surrounding areas.
“A rise in the water level in River Jhelum at Muzaffarabad was recorded, leaving residents panicked. They thought it was a flash flood released by India upstream,” a local resident told Dawn. “People kept watching the river, trying to check if any debris had come, like it does during flood seasons, but they couldn’t find anything,” he added.
A daily water situation report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) also confirmed an increase in water flow levels in River Jhelum. However, an officer from the Met Department’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) dismissed the concerns, stating the rise was part of usual seasonal flows.
 
 

“Typically, these days we see up to 50,000 cusecs in River Jhelum. As of now (April 26), we have 47,000 cusecs, which doesn’t even qualify as a low flood in the river,” Akhtar Mahmood, the FFD deputy director, explained to Dawn on Saturday. “A low flood in River Jhelum ranges between 75,000 and 110,000 cusecs,” he added.
He further clarified that water levels in all rivers typically rise during this period due to snowmelt and rainfall in the catchment areas. “The water level in River Jhelum at Manga always rises this time of year (until June 15) due to snowmelt, followed by monsoon rains. Similarly, water rising in the Indus at Tarbela is 80 per cent due to snowmelt,” he said.
“At times, the rise in Jhelum’s water level could also be due to the cleaning of a mini-reservoir at the Kishanganga run-of-the-river hydroelectric project. But I believe this rise is due to increased temperatures melting snow,” he concluded.
Unusual surge
The Muzaffarabad division commissioner said on Saturday that an unusual surge in the flow of River Jhelum was recorded after India released water into the river.
Speaking to Dawn, Chaudhry Guftar Hussain said that while the normal flow of the river in Muzaffarabad remained around 18 cumecs (cubic metres per second), it swelled to 26.4 cumecs at around 12:15pm. However, the flow reduced to 22 cumecs within an hour, he added.
Despite the sudden increase, the flood wave passed through the territorial limits of Muzaffarabad without causing any loss or damage, he said.
Mr Hussain said that so far, no adverse impact had been reported from the low-lying areas adjacent to the river, which are generally vulnerable to such surges. Nevertheless, he advised residents to continue exercising caution, particularly while moving near the riverbanks, as a preventive measure.
Water release
The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Saturday released 118,500  cusecs of water from various rim stations with inflow of 129,400 cusecs,  APP reported. According to data, the water level in River Indus at Tarbela Dam was 1431.43 feet, which was 29.43 feet higher than its dead level of 1402.00 feet. Water inflow and outflow in the dam was recorded as 39,100 cusecs and 43,300 cusecs, respectively.
The water level in River Jhelum at Mangla Dam was 1129.60 feet, which  was 79.60 feet higher than its dead level of 1,050 feet. The inflow and  outflow of water was recorded 47,100 cusecs and 32,000 cusecs,  respectively.
The release of water at Kalabagh, Taunsa, Guddu and Sukkur was recorded as 62,700, 44,300, 34,800 and 7,400 cus­ecs, respectively. Similarly, from River Kabul, 22,400 cusecs of water were released at Nowshera and 12,500 cusecs from River Chenab at Marala.

• UNSC slams Pahalgam attack; UN chief spokesperson says Guterres paying ‘very close attention’ to conflict
ISLAMABAD: As the fallout of the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians continues to reverberate across the region, Pakistan on Saturday called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack while also criticising India for leveling “baseless allegations” without a credible investigation or evidence.
“Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent, and credible investigation,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said during the passing-out parade of cadets at the Pakistan Military Academy.
PM Shehbaz emphasised Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying, “Pakis­tan has always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as the world’s frontline state against terrorism.” He also criticised India for what he described as a “pattern of exploitation” by leveling “baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence.”
He also drew a hard line on the issue of water resources, stressing continued water flow under the Indus Waters Treaty as a red line. “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline,” he said. “Any attempt to stop, reduce, or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus River Treaty would be responded to with full force and might.”
 
 

He vowed that Pakistan would not be deterred from supporting the Kashmir cause, stating, “Let there be no doubt Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices.”
New Delhi did not immediately respond to Pakistan’s offer.
The offer by the prem­i­­er came as several count­ries, including Iran, Saudi Ara­bia, China and the Uni­­­ted Kingdom, intensified diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
The Chinese and British envoys met with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday, while Mr Dar also spoke to his counterparts from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Egypt. All these discussions were dominated by the Pahalgam attack.
Tensions between the two countries soared in the aftermath of the attack as India took a series of harsh measures, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty, downgrading diplomatic relatio­­ns, revoking visas for Pakistani na­­­tionals — including those und­er the South Asian Associa­tion for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) visa exemption scheme — and halting bilateral trade. Security measures were also heightened.
Pakistan mirrored India’s steps and went further by banning Ind­ian airliners from using its airspa­­ce and warning it could suspend all bilateral agreements, including the landmark Simla Agree­ment, which underpins rela­­tions between the two countries.
While India has stopped short of directly blaming Pakistan, officials have hinted at cross-border involvement, a claim Islamabad has firmly denied.
UNSC slams attack
The UN Security Council also condemned the “terrorist” attack in the Indian occupied Kashmir, as the 15-member body also released Pakistan’s statement outlining its retaliatory countermeasures to New Delhi’s “reckless” steps announced in the wake of the April 22 incident.
 
 

In a press statement cited by the state-run APP, the council members called for accountability and international cooperation to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.
They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governments of India and Nepal, extending wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured in the attack.
Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, the council members reaffirmed. They underscored that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed.
The council members urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities.
They reaffirmed the need for states to combat by all means threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Cha­rter and other obligations under international law.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council released the press statement issued at the conclusion of Pakistan’s National Security Committee meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday, as an official document. The Pakistani statement contained the retaliatory decisions taken during the NSC’s deliberations.
In a letter, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to the UN Security Council President for April, Jerome Bonnafont of France, on Friday.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the agenda item ‘India-Pakistan Qu­­estion’,” the council president told the members.
Separately, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the UN chief was paying “very close attention” to the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.
“I don’t agree with your comment, (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation bet­ween India and Pakistan,” Spok­esperson Stephane Duja­rric told a New York Post reporter at the regular noon briefing at UN Hea­dquarters in New York.
Following a question from APP whether the UN chief planned to speak to the leaders of India and Pakistan on his return from Rome, Mr Dujarric said that he hoped to have something on it later. At this, the Post reporter commented, “Amazing, by the way, two nuclear countries … might go to war may merit such little attention…?” “I don’t agree with your comment (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation between India and Pakistan,” Mr Dujarric responded.

The former, with its vast reach and influence, is becoming increasingly aggressive, and often projects hostility not only towards its neighbours but also against its own marginalised communities.
However, both countries suffer from the absence of a credible peace lobby that can offer rational alternatives during moments of crisis and resist the pull of emotional hysteria that dominates the public discourse.
When the fragile calm breaks, India’s political leadership loses its composure, and the media — traditional and digital — deepens the crisis by crafting an environment of anxiety and manufactured outrage. Saner voices do exist, but they are quickly sidelined once nationalist narratives begin to dominate. For its part, Pakistan is not immune to these patterns either. While its media infrastructure lacks the algorithmic sophistication and narrative machinery of its Indian counterpart, it still often mirrors the same confrontational posture.
A peace lobby, in this context, is not merely desirable, it is absolutely vital. For two nations caught in an ongoing cycle of suspicion and hostility, the presence of cross-border peace advocates can play a role to promote stability. The role of these peace advocates can be particularly critical during periods of relative calm when there is an opportunity for engagement and trust-building to expand the space for dialogue and reduce the risk of future escalation.
Some efforts have attempted to fill this void. Both the countries’ civil society actors, academics and independent thinkers have contributed to dialogue through Track 2 and Track 1.5 diplomacy. Among the more visible initiatives are the Neemrana dialogue, involving retired military and diplomatic officials, and the Ottawa dialogue, which focuses on strategic stability and crisis management. The Pugwash conferences have occasionally created space for regional discussions on nuclear issues and peace.

The role of these peace advocates can be particularly critical during periods of relative calm.

Civil society has also made some contributions to foster sustained dialogue and regional cooperation, while media-led campaigns like Aman ki Asha attempted to revive cultural and trade ties. Academic institutions on both sides have produced policy-oriented research to support cross-border engagement. Simultaneously, cultural collaborations, joint film screenings, music projects, and poetry exchanges have kept alive alternative narratives of peace, often amplified by independent journalists and public intellectuals committed to de-escalation.
But for all their visibility and occasional breakthroughs, the impact of such initiatives has been limited in shaping the public discourse or influencing state behaviour in a sustained manner. The ideological divide that exists has continued to deepen, with the result that hatred thrives, especially in the unregulated expanse of social media, where polarising content overshadows the quiet work of bridge-builders. Without broader ownership by society and the political leadership, peace efforts risk remaining peripheral to the dominant narratives that drive nationalist sentiment.
Many of these initiatives are supported by public and private institutions in Europe and America. These institutions seek tangible, short-term outcomes from their engagements. However, peacebuilding, particularly in complex conflict zones such as South Asia, does not lend itself to linear results or limited time frames. Sustainable engagement can only come about through patience, continuity and deeper investment in trust-building — conditions that often frustrate donors operating on fixed cycles.
A second, perhaps more fundamental, issue is the composition of these forums, many of whose participants, particularly the former officials among them, were once embedded in state structures known to resist or undermine peace processes. The worldview of these participants was shaped by institutional legacies and security-centric thinking, which often limits the scope of dialogue. In a number of instances, rather than contributing to meaningful discussions, they derail the debate or treat such engagements as leisure trips. Most Track 2 meetings are held in third countries because of political hostility at home, which only further detaches the process from the ground realities.
There is also a gap at the conceptual level. These forums, while called ‘peace dialogues’, rarely evolve into genuine peace lobbies. Their structure and function often mirror state-centric priorities rather than offering a broader vision rooted in human security and democratic values. A true peace lobby must be independent, consistent and resilient. It must operate beyond the confines of geopolitics, resist the seductions of nationalism and maintain its moral clarity even when public sentiment turns hostile.
Over the years, as donor interest has waned and tangible outcomes have proved increasingly elusive, these initiatives have declined. However, their deeper failure lies in their inability to act effectively in times of crisis. Rather than countering war narratives, many actors within these forums echo official talking points, thus becoming unintentional amplifiers of the very forces they were meant to challenge.
To be a peacenik in this environment is hardly easy. It involves standing firm against the spoilers of peace and confronting emotional public sentiment. These proponents of peace would be stigmatised as anti-state and, in some cases, foreign agents. The pressure built by the public and media becomes unbearable in many instances.
It may require enduring the hostility of state institutions that view alternative narratives as threatening the official position. But such voices, no matter how marginal, are essential. Without them, the region risks becoming locked in an endless cycle of confrontation, with no exit strategy.
Unfortunately, the prospect of a robust, independent peace lobby in either country remains dim. In India, ultra-nationalism aligned closely with the Hindu supremacist ideology has merged with state power. Economic growth has further emboldened its expression, making it more exclusionary and intolerant. In Pakistan, the challenges are no less severe. Chronic extremism continues to erode the fabric of society, while the state, in its quest for a hard state, relies increasingly on alliances with religious groups whose outlook is inherently opposed to peace and pluralism.
In such a climate, the path to peace must begin by reimagining what a peace lobby can be: not a short-term project or a donor-driven initiative but a long-term social investment rooted in inclusivity, civic courage, and regional empathy. Until then, peace will remain a hope, not a policy.

He was responding to a question on the spiralling tension between the two nuclear-armed Sou­th Asian neighbours in the wake of the terror at­­tack on tourists in Pahalgam in India-held Ka­­shmir this week in which 26 civilians were killed.
 
 

Indicating that it held Pakistan responsible for the carnage, India announced a number of measures including reduction of diplomatic staff at the Pakistan mission in Delhi, expulsion of all military attachés, cancellation of visas issued to Pakistan nationals and more significantly holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty between the two countries that has survived several armed conflicts between them.
Pakistan retorted with its own measures mirroring the Indian move in terms of reduction of diplomatic mission staff, cancellation of visas, and more interestingly, mulling the suspension of bilateral agreements such as the Simla Agreement concluded after the 1971 war.

Matters are exacerbated because there appears to be no dialogue mechanism.

The Trump remarks, which echoed the assessment of some Western diplomats in Islamabad, shared privately with journalists, seemed to suggest that this diplomatic tit-for-tat was all the fallout from the Pahalgam incident that was to be; and that, after a tense period, de-escalation would likely follow. But the mood in India, at least judging from the media, belied this assessment as it was belligerent and jingoistic. An array of recently retired senior military and intelligence officials all seemed convinced that the Modi government would not let the matter rest with the diplomatic measures but would surely plan a ‘kinetic’ operation to ‘punish’ Pakistan.
One Indian anchor on a mainstream channel as­­­­­­­ked a recently retired three-star general who commanded the corps in Kashmir if the kinetic action could include “eliminating some major or brigadier of the Pakistani military or its intelligence services who ordered the Pahalgam attack?”
“Why stop at a brigadier or junior officers,” the former three-star responded. This same former military officer drew parallels between Hamas and its activities with the Pakistani military and intelligence services. He also suggested Pakistan face similar consequences to the campaign of Israeli occupation forces against Gaza.
Shockingly insane as this chalk and cheese (to put it mildly) comparison was, I was left wondering if this was a retired officer airing his own dream or was this view shared by India’s military commanders and the political decision-making set-up with the Hindu nationalist BJP at the helm.
If social and legacy media is a representative measure of the sentiment in India, then let me say that I have watched many, many Indian experts, military and civilian, betraying zero empathy for the victims of the Gaza genocide. Also, they have been repeatedly expressing admiration and envy for the Israeli occupation forces, and wondering aloud why their country could not replicate this against Pakistan.
Of course, there are a few, isolated voices of sanity, even though they appear to be losing the battle to be heard against the cacophony of the utterly insane ones, reminding their compatriots of the perils of creating a momentum leading to an armed conflict between two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The main value of the nuclear deterrent is to forestall a conventional war, especially between two numerically uneven adversaries, and only the deranged would want to see the situation spiralling towards such a possibility because it leads to mutually assured destruction.
Yes, experts would take us down the path of second strike capability and who has it and who doesn’t. But to me all that does not mask an unprecedented threat to humanity, to one-and-a-half billion people, in the two countries and even more across South Asia.
The Modi government has often demonstrated the hold it enjoys over most of the country’s mass media and has social media handles, amplifying its view, running into millions. So, if it doesn’t wish the media to raise public expectations of ‘kinetic action to punish Pakistan including assassinations’ into becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, it may consider dialling down some of the rhetoric that the public is feeding off.
It is prudent of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to offer an ‘impartial and transparent’ probe into the Pahalgam incident so the Indian allegations of Pakistan’s role can be evaluated and discarded as not being legitimate or credible.
Some India peaceniks say this offer would not be seen as amounting to much at this time because it would have helped if Pakistan had taken its probe into the 2008 Mumbai attacks — which saw militants kill some 175 people and injure nearly 300 — to its logical conclusion but it did not.
That may be a valid point but since then, Pakistan’s actions against militant groups as part of its compliance with the Financial Action Task Force regulations on terror funding, money laundering, etc, has choked them off and resulted in the jailing of many key figures. Additionally, observers also point out to at least two to three ‘false flag operations’ where it was subsequently established that allegations of Pakistani involvement were patently false.
Equally, at a time when the Pakistani military and civilian leadership has assigned top priority to economic recovery and stability, an incident such as the Pahalgam massacre would be totally counterproductive to its prioritised cause. Any such incident’s fallout would harm Pakistan more than India.
Whenever passions are running high, sanity tends to take a backseat. Despite Western optimism about South Asia peace, the situation appears poised on a hair trigger. Matters are exacerbated because there appears to be no dialogue mechanism between India and Pakistan.
Against this backdrop, Saudi and Iranian mediation efforts represent hope of a peaceful resolution and should be welcomed. The Saudi foreign minister has already talked to his counterparts in New Delhi and Islamabad but we await details of the conversations.

Directed efforts to reduce tensions and force diplomacy just might. It seems India may have overplayed its hand by jumping straight to accusations against its eastern neighbour, which the rest of the world has not been as ready to accept as it may have hoped. This should boost morale in Islamabad, and Pakistani authorities have made the right move by calling for a neutral, international probe into the Pahalgam tragedy.
But with America neck-deep in the Ukraine and Middle East crises, there seems to be little interest in Washington about the possible outcomes of the latest Pakistan-India flare-up. Various Trump administration officials have offered India their sympathies and some support, but not the validation New Delhi has desperately sought for its combative stance against Pakistan. But US President Donald Trump can do better than expect the two states to “get it figured out, one way or another”.
 
 

India’s extreme reaction to the attack has created a situation in which a global intervention may be necessary to create space for de-escalation, and Mr Trump, who claims to know the leadership of both countries, may be better placed than most to find a way out.
Meanwhile, others are already attempting to defuse the crisis. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran, both countries with strong relationships with India and Pakistan, have made phone calls to Islamabad and New Delhi, offering to mediate crisis talks.
The UN has called for maximum restraint and “meaningful mutual engagement”, with the UN spokesman telling media in New York that issues between the countries “can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”. There is, after all, much at stake given both countries’ nuclear-armed status and propensity for conflict.
It is therefore far more mature to seek de-escalation through intermediation than to expect that the two countries, which even ordinarily refuse to talk to each other, will figure out their differences in the midst of a severe breakdown in trust.
It is hoped that other responsible world powers will also act before any mistake or misadventure occurs that could further inflame tensions. Sense needs to be restored so that the Pahalgam attack may be independently investigated and the victims given justice.

The participants of the rally, led by PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal and Dr Hamid Achakzai, gathered in Quetta Metropolitan Corporation compound before the rally. They chanted slogans against the deportation of Afghan refugees and Peca Act.
They marched on various streets of the provincial capital carrying party flags, placards and banners inscribed with their demands.
The rally after reaching Manan Chowk converted into a public meeting which was addressed by Mr Ziaratwal, Dr Abdul Hamid Khan Achakzai, Abdul Haq Abdal, and others.
The speakers told the protesters that Afghan refugees came to Pakistan through UNHCR and spent over 40 years in the country. They made social relations with local people, established their business along with the people of Pakistan and now the government is sending them back to Afghanistan forcibly instead of giving them citizenship, the gathering was told.
They said that the West granted citizenship to those people who spend five years while the Pakistan government sent them after 40 long years. They demanded that Afghan “Kadwal” should not be repatriated rather be given Pakistani Citizenship and as Pakistani citizens will spend their lives peacefully according to the constitution and law of the land.
They condemned the treatment being done with the Afghan refugees while sending them to their country as said that their three generations during their stay as refugees obtained medical, engineering and other disciplines in Pakistani universities. They said that Afghan refugees should be recognized Pakistani citizen and issued citizenship certificate.

The warning was issued on World Malaria Day, as both WHO and Pakistan  called on all stakeholders to urgently intensify efforts to contain the  growing threat to the country and the region.
“Malaria is a major global threat, and we are seeing firsthand how  climate change is increasing both the risk and the cases in our  country,” said Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal. “Despite  challenges, Pakistan is fully committed to end this disease. It is not  just a health imperative — it is an investment in a healthier, more  equitable, safer, and more prosperous future for every nation.”
Under the international theme, “Reinvest, reimagine,  reignite,” WHO urged all stakeholders to join the big push to end malaria and support Pakistan’s efforts so that the response is not  undermined by a lack of resources.

Floods and rising temperatures have been identified as major factors to the surge in cases, with a reported peak of 2.7 million cases in 2023

The catastrophic 2022 floods triggered 6.6 million additional cases  over the 2022–2024 period — including a peak of 2.7 million cases in  2023, compared to 399,097 cases in 2021. As a result, the malaria burden  in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region surged to an estimated 10.2  million cases in 2023 — a 137 per cent increase compared to 2015.
Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made over the  past decade in prevention and treatment. In partnership with WHO and  with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria, Pakistan screened more than 11.4 million suspected cases in  2024 and treated 2 million confirmed malaria patients.
Additionally, 7.8m insecticide-treated nets were distributed  in 22 high-burden districts, contributing to a reduction in cases from  2.7m in 2023 to 2m last year.
“WHO is proud to partner with Pakistan to continue saving lives by  preventing and treating malaria,” said Dr. Dapeng Luo, WHO  Representative in Pakistan. “We have proven that investing in malaria  response saves lives, but we are also seeing how climate change is  hampering progress, posing a threat not only for Pakistan, but also for  the region and the world. We know how to end malaria, and we can do it  if all stakeholders invest and work together to reinforce the response  and adapt to the new risks triggered by climate change.”
According to data from 5,575 medical facilities across 80 endemic  districts, climate change and related impacts such as rising  temperatures and frequent flooding have led to an upward trend in  malaria cases and heightened risk of outbreaks.
Other contributing  factors include increasing poverty, limited access to quality  diagnostics and treatment, deteriorating security in Balochistan, tribal  areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and health care access issues in Sindh.
Evidence  shows that malaria control efforts are effective, but sustained and  coordinated action will be essential to mitigate the effects of climate  change, save lives and secure a healthier future for Pakistan.

Speaking at a news briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, at the conclusion of his visit to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group, Mr Aura­ngzeb disclosed that Pakistan has asked China to augment its existing currency swap line by an additional 10 billion yuan (approximately $1.4bn).
Pakistan currently mainta­ins a 30bn yuan swap line with China. “From our perspective, getting to 40bn renminbi would be good,” the minister said.
Explaining Islamabad’s priorities, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised that addressing the trade imbalance with the US was more important for Pakistan than the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs. He noted that President Trump was determined to boost US exports to trading partners as part of his broader trade agenda.

Aurangzeb requests China to boost yuan swap line

Currently, Pakistan exports approximately $5.2bn worth of goods to the US, while imports from the United States stand at around $2bn, creating a surplus of about $3.2bn in Pakistan’s favour. “We are looking at the possibility of addressing this imbalance by importing more goods such as American cotton and soybean,” he said.
The minister added that following President Trump’s ann­ouncement of new tariffs, Pak­istan’s ambassador in Washing­ton contacted the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the very next day. “Now a delegation will come for formal talks. The date of the visit will be decided after I return to Islamabad,” he said.
Indus Waters Treaty dispute
Asked if Pakistan had sought the World Bank’s intervention after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty last week, Mr Aurangzeb responded: “If required, we will come to it when it’s appropriate.”
The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank, governs the use of rivers shared by India and Pakistan and recognizes the Bank’s arbitral role in resolving disputes. So far, both nations have eng­aged with the World Bank to address differences under the treaty.
Mr Aurangzeb said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet have already deliberated on the issue and were prepared to move forward. “We condemn terrorism wherever it happens. We want good relations with all our neighbors but it takes two to tango,” he remarked.
He added that tensions between India and Pakistan were “a part of life” and stressed the need to “move with it and move on”.
Asked about the potential economic fallout from the recent tensions following the killing of 26 people at a tourist site earlier this month, the minister acknowledged that it was “not going to be helpful.”
Diplomatic sources told Dawn that due to the busy schedule of World Bank officials during the Spring Meetings, Pakistani diplomats could not immediately raise the issue. “We are also waiting for instructions from Islamabad to proceed,” the sources said.
China commitments, Panda Bond plans
During his meetings in Washington, Mr Aurangzeb also engaged with Chinese officials, including Finance Minister Lan Fo’an, to seek extensions in Pakistan’s debt repayment schedules and additional financial support.
He confirmed that Pakistan has asked China to extend the repayment period for its guaranteed debt and to increase the existing $4.3bn currency swap arrangement, aiming to bolster Pakistan’s critically low foreign exchange reserves. “He was assured that China would roll over Pakistan’s $4bn cash deposit with the IMF,” officials said.
Discussions with China also included the rescheduling of debt owed to the Chinese Export-Import (Exim) Bank during the duration of Pakistan’s ongoing IMF programme. Pakistan is seeking to reschedule debt maturities until September 2027. Aurangzeb noted that a similar request had been made to China last year, but formal approval was still pending.
Pakistan has also made significant progress in preparations to issue its first “Panda Bond” — a bond issued on China’s domestic market, denominated in yuan. Talks with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Develop­ment Bank (ADB) for providing credit enhancements for the bond issue had been “constructive”, Mr Aurangzeb said.
“We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that — we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print,” he added.
China has been actively promoting currency swap arrangements with emerging economies like Argentina and Sri Lanka in recent years as part of its broader strategy to internationalize the yuan.
Progress with IMF
Mr Aurangzeb said he also expects the IMF Executive Board to approve, in early May, the staff-level agreement for a new $1.3bn arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.

Talking to the media on Saturday, the minister said that Pakistan’s stance on the Indus Waters Treaty was “clear and firm”. He said the treaty could only be revoked through mutual consent between Pakistan and India and could not be unilaterally suspended.
He said that Pakistan has an undeniable right over every single drop of water under the treaty. He further said that India’s baseless statement only damaged its credibility on the global stage, highlighting India’s involvement in terrorist activities across various countries, including Canada.
 
 

Pakistan would not allow even a single drop of water from its rivers to be diverted unlawfully, he said.
“No one can steal the water of our rivers,” he said, adding that international bodies are already engaged in the matter to ensure a fair resolution.
Speaking at the second convocation of Ghazi University in Dera Ghazi Khan, Mr Leghari said terrorism remained a national challenge and vowed that the government fully supported all efforts to eradicate it.
He said he supported a public Jirga recently held by Mir Badshah Qaisrani in support of law enforcement agencies, saying, “We endorse every measure taken in the defence of the country.”
The federal minister affirmed that Pakistan was fully capable of defending itself.
He also reiterated that the fight against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication, emphasising the unflinching resolve of the country’s armed forces and law enforcement agencies. However, he criticised former prime minister Imran Khan for allegedly allowing the return of 40,000 terrorists from Afghanistan, stating that Pakistan was still dealing with the consequences of that decision.
Meanwhile, a letter purported to be from India’s water resources ministry — circulating on social media — appeared to officially convey New Delhi’s wish to suspend implementation of the IWT.
Dawn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the letter, written by India’s Jal Shakti ministry secretary Ms Debashree Mukherjee to Pakistan’s ministry of water resources secretary Syed Ali Murtaza on April 24.
Neither the minister for water resources nor the Indus Water Commissioner responded to Dawn’s requests for confirmation and comment on the letter’s contents.

Although the cause of the blast was not immediately clear, the port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state TV that it probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazmat and chemical materials storage depot.
State media reported a “massive explosion” at Sh­a­hid Rajaee, the country’s largest commercial port, located in Hormozgan province on the southern coast.
Footage on state TV showed thick columns of black smoke billowing from the port where many containers are stored, with helicopters deployed to fight the flames.
Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that at least 516 people were injured and “hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres”.
“Unfortunately, at least four deaths have been confirmed by rescuers,” the head of the Red Crescent Society’s Relief and Rescue Organisation, Babak Mahmoudi, earlier told the broadcaster.
Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate.
Iranian President Mas­oud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”, sending Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni to look into the incident.
Images from the official IRNA news agency showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris.
Flames engulfed a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car.
Containers stacked at the port appeared to have buckled in the blast.
Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) south of Tehran, is Iran’s most advanced container port, according to IRNA.
It is located 23km west of Bandar Abbas, the Hormozgan provincial capital, and near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of world oil output passes.
Containers exploded
Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of the province’s crisis management authority, told state TV that “the cause of this incident was the explosion of several containers stored in the Shahid Rajaee Port wharf area”.
“We are currently evacuating and transporting the injured to nearby medical centres,” he said.
The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50km away, Fars news agency reported, with residents saying they could feel the ground shake even at a distance.
“The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported.
The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that “the explosion at Shahid Rajaee Port has no connection to refineries, fuel tanks, distribution complexes or oil pipelines”.
It added that “Bandar Abbas oil facilities are currently operating without interruption”.
The rare explosion comes several months after one of Iran’s deadliest work accidents in years.
The coal mine blast in September, caused by a gas leak, killed more than 50 people at Tabas in the east of the country.
Saturday’s explosion also came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
PM Shehbaz grieved
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday expressed deep sorrow over the losses caused by the explosion at the Iranian port.
In a message of condolence, he extended heartfelt sympathies to the government and people of Iran. He also offered prayers for swift recovery of those injured in the tragic incident.  “In this hour of grief and sorrow, we stand firmly with the Iranian government and the brotherly people of Iran,” the PM stated.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran during this difficult time.

As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index ended the outgoing week in negative territory, breaking its bullish momentum.
On Tuesday, IMF slashed its growth forecast for Pakistan to 2.6 per cent from 3pc for the current fiscal year, citing the impact of US tariffs. Fitch Ratings projected that the rupee may depreciate to Rs285 against the dollar in the coming months and to Rs295 by June 2026. 
AKD Securities Ltd said the PSX remained volatile throughout the week, as escalating geopolitical tensions post the Pahalgam attack and India’s subsequent threat to revoke the Indus Water Treaty undermined investor sentiment.
However, positive news stemmed from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook for April, lowering Pakistan’s inflation forecast for FY25 to 5.1pc year-on-year from the earlier 10pc and 7.7pc for FY26. 
News reports indicate that the government had reached a preliminary agreement with two foreign commercial banks for a $1bn loan facility at an interest rate of 7.6pc. 
Moreover, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with representatives from the credit rating agency Moody’s to improve Pakistan’s credit rating following a recent upgrade by Fitch. 
According to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), Pakistani shares exhibited mixed trends during the outgoing week, initially continuing its upward trajectory driven by encouraging economic indicators.
However, the momentum weakened later in the week due to rising geopolitical tensions. On the macroeconomic front, banking sector deposits recorded a healthy growth of 11.7pc year-on-year in March. However, the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reserves declined $367m to $10.2bn.
Amid geopolitical noise and cautious investor sentiment, the benchmark KSE-100 index closed the week at 115,469 points, marking a fall of 1,846 points or 1.6pc week-on-week.
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from E&P (594 points), commercial banks (295 points), technology (188 points), power (140 points), and pharmaceutical (116 points). Meanwhile, the sectors that contributed positively were fertiliser (162 points), food (74 points), and automobile assembler (23 points). Scrip-wise negative contributors were UBL (507 points), Mari Energies (369 points), Engro Fertiliser (225 points), PSO (181 points), and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (151 points).
Whereas scrip-wise positive contributions came from Fauji Fertiliser Company (403 points), Meezan Bank (237 points), MCB Bank (120 points), Sui Northern Gas Pipeline (78 points) and National Foods (54 points).
Foreigner buying clocked in at $2.09m compared to a net sell of $4.01m the previous week. Major buying was witnessed in OMCs ($2.7m), followed by E&Ps ($1.1m). On the local front, selling was reported by mutual funds ($18.9m) and Broker Propriety Trading ($2.02m).
The average trading volume tumbled 32pc to 599m shares while the value traded was down 10pc to $104mweek-on-week.
According to AHL, investor sentiment will remain closely tied to the evolving India-Pakistan situation in the upcoming week. Key announcements will likely fuel stock-specific momentum with the corporate earnings season underway.

According to a press release issued by the central bank, the SBP chief met senior executives from global financial and investment institutions, including JP Morgan, Standard Chartered, Deutsche, Jefferies, and major credit rating agencies and briefed them on the tangible progress Pakistan has made in stabilising its economy. 
He highlighted that a prudent monetary policy, combined with sustained fiscal consolidation efforts, has led to macroeconomic stability in the country.
Mr Ahmad highlighted that headline inflation has declined sharply over the past two years, reaching a multi-decade low of 0.7 per cent in March.
Moreover, core inflation has also come down significantly from above 22pc to a single digit and is expected to moderate further in the coming months. He added that the headline inflation is expected to stabilise within its target range of 5 to 7pc.  
Regarding the external account, the SBP governor said Pakistan’s foreign exchange buffers had registered a substantial qualitative and quantitative improvement. SBP’s reserves have tripled since bottoming out in February 2023, whereas its forward liabilities have also reduced significantly. 
Mr Ahmad highlighted that, unlike previous episodes of reserve build-up, the ongoing rise in external buffers is not due to any further accumulation of external debt. Pakistan’s public sector external debt, both in absolute terms and as a per cent of GDP, has declined since June 2022. The governor emphasised that this improvement reflects SBP’s policy focus on building the economy’s resilience against external shocks, including the ongoing trade-related global uncertainty. He explained that SBP has built these buffers through forex purchases amidst a surplus in the external current account. He also shared that SBP is targeting to increase FX reserves to $14bn by June 2025.

The business environment is generally slow on Saturdays, as many multinational companies take a half-day or a full day off. However, export-oriented units operate 24 hours on double shifts to meet export deadlines.
However, industries have already been facing raw material shortages for over 10 days owing to a disruption in the supply chain due to the blocking of highways by lawyers and civil society protesting against canal issues as containers and trucks loaded with goods had been stranded at various parts of Sindh.
Supply of goods from industries to the markets and distributors was partially hampered as many markets remained closed in the mornings, and some resumed business after 4:00pm.

Nationwide shutdown was called by Jamaat-i-Islami against Israeli brutality

While supporting the strike, Faisal Moiz Khan, President of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry, stated that around 60pc of the 5,000 to 6,000 units in the area remained shut, with 70pc of them being export-oriented.
He said exporters opted to operate only one shift as workers could not reach their workplaces due to thin public transport.
Mr Moiz said the textile sector has been facing a yarn crisis, which failed to reach from Punjab due to a halt in goods carrier movement in Sindh areas due to sit-ins and strikes by lawyers. 
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry President Junaid Naqi said the industrial activities in over 4,000 units remained normal as multinational companies on Saturdays usually work half day or keep their units closed. 
“I do not support any strike called by any political parties. It is better to financially help the victims and meet their needs rather than closing the industries and businesses or blocking the roads,” he said. He said production remained affected where raw material could not reach from Punjab due to supply chain issues owing to protests and sit-ins.
Site Association of Industry President Ahmed Azeem Alvi said the production activities in over 3,500 units in the Site area showed a mixed trend as some units recorded partial activities while others operated at full capacity. He believed it was essential to condemn the genocide being committed against the people in Gaza by Israeli forces. However, he also emphasised that business and trading activities should continue as the employment of thousands of individuals tied to them, and the country cannot afford any economic losses. “Business and politics should be separated,” Alvi said.
F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry President Sheikh Mohammad Tehsin said that almost all the 1,000 industries in the area were open on Saturday. However, some units faced low arrival of staffers and workers due to transport issues.

Rehman, in the video, could be seen “driving his vehicle with the help of his feet, showing extreme carelessness and recklessness”, the FIR read.
It added that the actions of the YouTuber not only endangered his own life and property, but also of the other people travelling on the motorway.
The FIR said that the suspect had committed vandalism against whom the prosecution has filed the case.
According to the FIR, the case against the YouTuber was registered under Article 67 (driving recklessly or dangerously) of the National Highway Safety Ordinance (NHSO) 2000, and Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26225252fde14f3.jpg?r=225458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906740/mahrangs-sister-seeks-cjps-urgent-intervention-against-alleged-mistreatment-of-detained-byc-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Mahrang’s sister seeks CJP’s ‘urgent intervention’ against alleged mistreatment of detained BYC leaders</strong></a><br><p>Nadia Baloch, sister of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch, on Saturday wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi requesting “urgent intervention” against the alleged mistreatment of her sibling and other leaders of the group in prison.
On Friday, Mahrang and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin.
“Dr Mahrang Baloch has said that the hunger strike was launched to protest the torture by CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) officials inside the district jail and the transfer of Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin,” Mahrang’s lawyer Imran Baloch told Dawn.com.
According to the letter, which has been seen by Dawn.com, Nadia alleged that Mahrang “is subjected daily to mental torture and coercion to abandon her peaceful movement”.
“Upon her refusal, an attempt was made to move her to an undisclosed location, and when she resisted, she was physically assaulted by officials on 23.04.2025,” she alleged.
She also informed the CJP about the transfer of Beebow to District Jail Pishin, alleging that the activist’s whereabouts were unknown for an entire day.
“It was subsequently discovered that she had been shifted to District Jail, Pishin, under constant surveillance, including the installation of cameras compromising her privacy even within washroom areas,” Nadia alleged.
Nadia also lamented the detention of Sibghatullah Shah, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch and stated that the treatment of the BYC leaders violates Articles 4 (guarantee to be treated in accordance with law), 9 (protection of life and liberty) and 14 (inviolability of dignity and protection against torture) of the Constitution.
She added that Rules 939, 940 and 1065 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978 were also violated.
“[The provisions] mandate the humane and impartial treatment of all detainees. These provisions place a clear duty on the superintendent to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety, dignity, and protection of prisoners under their custody.”
Nadia added that under Sections 167(5) and 167(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (CrPC), female prisoners could not be transferred between detention facilities without court approval.
“Any attempt to remove the detainees from District Jail Quetta to another jail within the province, therefore, would constitute an arbitrary and unlawful exercise of authority,” she wrote.
“Regrettably, despite the above legal safeguards, government officials are actively pursuing such transfers. In fact, Ms Beebow Baloch has already been forcibly moved to District Jail Pishin while in custody, following the use of physical force,” Nadia alleged.
In the letter, Nadia urged the CJP to “take urgent notice of the physical and mental torture inflicted upon these detainees; prevent any further unlawful transfer or removal without due legal process; direct that their fundamental rights be fully protected in accordance with law and that their safety be ensured during their confinement”.
“This intervention is not only necessary but urgent, as the continued inaction
threatens their fundamental rights, personal safety and well-being,” Nadia wrote.
“Such an intervention would be in line with the reform efforts Your Lordship has undertaken for the betterment of prisoners.”
Mahrang and other BYC activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Her arrest under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordnance drew widespread condemnation from Baloch rights activists and international rights bodies.
The Balochistan National Party-Mengal started a “long march” from Wadh to Quetta on March 28 to protest the arrests of BYC leaders and activists, including Mahrang and Sammi Deen Baloch, who was released on April 1. The sit-in concluded on April 16, with the party announcing it would launch a public outreach movement instead.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26230747bba75cc.png?r=230815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906741/2-soldiers-martyred-15-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>2 soldiers martyred, 15 terrorists killed in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Two soldiers have been martyred and 15 terrorists killed in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted on Friday and Saturday.
The ISPR said eight terrorists were “sent to hell” after troops effectively engaged them at their location during an IBO in Karak district based on the reported militant presence.
It said that four more were killed by the security forces in another IBO in North Waziristan district.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists who were actively involved in numerous terror activities.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26214643a68e6d0.jpg?r=214720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906737/two-year-old-us-girl-deported-to-honduras-judge' target='_blank'><strong>Two-year-old US girl deported to Honduras: judge</strong></a><br><p>A two-year-old American girl has been deported with her undocumented mother to Honduras, a federal judge in Louisiana has said, but United States President Donald Trump’s administration contends that the woman asked for her child to be sent with her.
The case is the latest to pit the US judiciary against Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, as the administration pursues mass expulsions of undocumented migrants from American soil.
Federal District Judge Terry Doughty has set a May 16 hearing in the case “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”, according to a court order dated Friday.
“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her. But the court doesn’t know that,” wrote Doughty, recalling that it is illegal to deport a US citizen.
The girl has only been identified by the initials VML.
Attorneys for her father filed an emergency request for a temporary restraining order aimed at obtaining the girl’s return.
The Trump administration has butted heads with federal judges, rights groups and Democrats who say he has trampled or ignored constitutional rights in rushing to deport migrants, sometimes without the right to a hearing.
On Friday, federal agents arrested a US judge in Wisconsin for allegedly shielding an undocumented migrant.

Trump and his affiliates hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, which launched last year. The US president has promised to regulate the industry favourably and his administration has eased enforcement actions against several big industry players.
A press release from the finance ministry said a WLF delegation visited Islamabad today and signed a letter of intent with the PCC. The delegation comprised Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, the son of Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“[The] WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the press release reads.
It added that the delegation met the prime minister, chief of army staff, deputy prime minister, information and defence ministers to formalise cooperation, “marking a major step toward positioning Pakistan as a global leader in the digital finance revolution”.
The statement said the government has signalled plans to announce comprehensive crypto legalisation policies soon, to bolster “Pakistan’s position as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world”.
The letter was signed during a meeting between the WLF and the PCC, which was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb via video link. PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank governor were also present.

“The scope of cooperation between [the] PCC and WLF outlines collaboration in key areas including: launching regulatory sandboxes for blockchain financial product testing; facilitating the responsible growth of DeFi (decentralised finance) protocols; exploring [the] tokenisation of real-world assets like real estate and commodities; expanding stablecoin applications for remittances and trade; and providing strategic advisory on blockchain infrastructure and global regulatory trends,” the press release reads.
Aurangzeb was quoted as saying, “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy.”
Saqib, meanwhile, said the agreement was “more than just a partnership, it’s a strategic move to empower our young population and integrate Pakistan into the future of global finance”.
The statement said the WLF leadership praised Pakistan’s dynamism, stating that Pakistan’s energy, vision and talent made it one of the most exciting places in the world to build the future of decentralised finance.
The finance ministry stated that Pakistan, with 64pc of its population under the age of 30, offered one of the world’s most promising digital economies.
“The country ranks among the top in global crypto adoption, with an estimated $300 billion in annual crypto transactions and 25 million active crypto users,” the press release said.
“With rising mobile penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and strong government interest in blockchain, Pakistan’s youth are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of Web3 innovation.”
Last month, Saqib said that the country planned to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan.
In an interview with Bloomberg, Saqib said Pakistan aimed to create “a clear regulatory framework for governing digital-asset activities to boost the local ecosystem”.
“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” he said, adding that they wanted to attract international investment because the country was a low-cost high-growth market with 60pc of the population under 30.</p><small>2025-04-26 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26153039a989f5a.jpg?r=154735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906709/businesses-across-country-remain-closed-in-solidarity-with-palestinians' target='_blank'><strong>Businesses across country remain closed in solidarity with Palestinians</strong></a><br><p>Various cities across the country on Saturday observed a shutter-down strike called by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against the ongoing Israeli assault in Gaza and to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
The strike was announced by JI central chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, as he delivered a fiery speech to the party’s ‘Palestine Solidarity March’ in Islamabad. The demonstration protested against the Israeli atrocities in Gaza and took place on the Islamabad Expressway.
The Israeli offensive, which began in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and hospital infrastructure in the enclave. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.
A strike was observed today in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta.  Other parts of Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan also remained shut. Shops and markets remained closed and vehicles largely stayed off the roads.

In Karachi, several leaders of the trade bodies participated in the protest, including All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir, Cooperative Market General Secretary Aslam Khan, Paper Market Syed Liaquat Ali etc.
Other than Karachi, the strike was observed in other cities of the province including Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, Ghotki, Nawabshah, Thatta, Jacobabad, Kandhkot, and Shikarpur.

Meanwhile, solidarity rallies were also taken out by JI and other religious parties from morning to evening.
The rally in Larkana was led by Sindh JI Ameer Kashif Saeed Sheikh and Ameer District Advocate Nadir Ali Khosa.
In Punjab, a shutter-down strike was observed by the business community across the province. All business centres and shops were closed in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Jhelum.
JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that he was not the one to take credit for the countrywide strike, rather, he would appreciate the efforts of the traders and business owners.
“There could not be a greater portrayal of unity than this [strike],” the JI chief said at a protest in Lahore.
Rehman said that people had gathered in support of Palestine in large numbers in all four cities, adding that there was “no colour, race, language or sect” among the people. “Everyone is standing up for the oppressed people and are against the oppressors,” he said.
A similar strike was observed in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan as markets, shops, and other commercial centres there remained closed.

Balochistan JI provincial chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch thanked the people for making the strike peaceful and successful, adding that if “we unite against oppression, coercion and lawlessness, we will become a great force”.
The shutter-down strike was also observed across KP.

On November 3, 2022, during the PTI’s long march in the Wazirabad area of Punjab, a gunman opened fire, injuring Imran, Senator Faisal Javed, and several others, while one worker lost his life.
The PTI founding chairman had accused the then-coalition government and some military officials of involvement in the attack. However, a case of the incident was registered on behalf of the police. The case was lodged on November 7, and a joint investigation team (JIT) was formed under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.
 
 

ATC Judge Muhammad Naeem Saleem pronounced the verdict in the case after a hearing today in which two co-accused, Tayyab Jahangir Butt and Waqas, were acquitted after being granted the benefit of the doubt.
According to a warrant of commitment of sentence issued today to the superintendent of the Gujranwala Central Jail, Naveed Bashir was sentenced to life imprisonment separately under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 302b (premeditated murder) and Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) Section 7a (punishment for acts of terrorism).
Under the two sections, he was also ordered to pay compensation of Rs500,000 to the legal heirs of slain PTI worker Moazzam in the form of arrears of land revenue, with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of failure to pay, and to pay a fine of Rs500,000, with further imprisonment for six months in case of default.
As restitution for Areeb, who suffered injuries in the attack, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Meer Umar Farooq, another man who injured in the incident, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of five years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fv (hashimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Imran Yousaf, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Muhammad Liaquat, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
The warrant said the sentences would run concurrently and the convict could avail the benefit of the Criminal Procedure Code Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment).
The lawyer for the convict, Advocate Mian Dawood, announced that the sentence would be challenged in the Lahore High Court, citing alleged irregularities in the prosecution’s arguments and evidence pertaining to the accused.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.  Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
Addressing a passing-out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, PM Shehbaz said: “The recent tragedy in Pahalgam is yet another example of this perpetual blame game, which must come to a grinding halt. Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation.”
The premier criticised India for continuing with a “pattern of exploitation, levelling baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence”.

Speaking on India’s recent move to suspend the IWT, PM Shehbaz said: “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline […] Let there be no doubt at all [that] its availability will be safeguarded at all costs and under all circumstances.
“Therefore, any attempt to stop, reduce or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty would be responded to with full force and might. Nobody should remain under any kind of false impression and confusion,” the prime minister warned.
“Our valiant armed forces remain fully capable and prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity against any misadventures, as clearly demonstrated by our measured yet resolute response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019,” he added, referring to ‘Operation Swift Retort’.
Expressing his “fullest confidence” in the armed forces, PM Shehbaz said, “This nation of 240 million people stands united by and behind our brave armed forces and ready to safeguard every inch of our homeland Pakistan.”
He stressed: “Peace is our preference but must not be construed as our weakness.”
During his address, the prime minister also reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.
“As Founder of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah rightly said, Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan. Unfortunately, this globally recognised dispute remains unresolved despite multiple UN resolutions.
“Let there be no doubt, Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices,” he added.
Hours later, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi echoed the PM’s demands during a press conference.
“There is Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan,” Naqvi said. “Pakistan is making progress in terms of the economy and stability, so an incident like this (Pahalgam attack) harms us.”
He warned that, “If anyone tries to harm us or our rights, all 240 million people are ready to fight to their last breath.”
Naqvi stated that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all of its forms and added that the country had done so at every international forum.
Reading out a statement on the Indian stance in English, the interior minister officially demanded a “transparent and impartial investigation” on the Pahalgam attack.
“Given the current situation and historical context, Pakistan has serious reservations regarding Indian credibility in conducting a fair inquiry,” he read.
“We call for a neutral and independent body to lead this inquiry. Pakistan is fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators to ensure that the truth is uncovered and justice is served,” Naqvi said.
The interior minister added that while Pakistan was committed to peace and stability, it “will not compromise on its sovereignty”.
Naqvi said that Pakistan wanted the truth to come out and to “expose this drama”.
“The ball is now in India’s court,” he said.
 


Among India’s aggressive measures announced on April 23 against Pakistan was the unilateral move to suspend the 1960 IWT, which was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
 
 

India also shut its borders and downgraded diplomatic ties over what its government and media claimed — without offering any evidence — was Islamabad’s alleged support for cross-border terrorism.
The next day, the National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad announced Pakistan’s response — putting all trade, bilateral pacts and flights off-limits for its eastern neighbour. It also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
The full text of the NSC statement can be read here.
As tensions rose between the nuclear powers, voices from across the world, including the United Nations, called on both countries to exercise restraint. While Saudi Arabia and Iran offered to mediate, United States President Donald Trump said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
In an interesting remark, Trump said: “There have been tensions on that border for 1,500 years so, you know, it’s the same as it has been.” Since the attack, Trump and other US officials have offered India “full support” in hunting down the perpetrators of the violent incident.
PM raises issue of terrorism from Afghan soil, stresses better ties
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz once again raised Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism with Afghanistan, emphasising the desire for improved ties.
“It is our earnest desire to live in peace with them (Afghanistan) for all times to come. Unfortunately, despite our best and sincere efforts, terrorist activities continue to emanate from Afghan territory,” he said during his address in Kakul.
Recalling Deputy PM Ishaq Dar’s recent visit to Kabul, the premier asserted: “We shall continue our efforts to have better relations and understanding with our brotherly and neighbourly country Afghanistan.
“However, we have also delivered a strong and clear message to the interim Afghan government that while we desire peaceful neighbourly relations with Kabul, this cannot happen as long as the Afghan soil is being used by Fitna-Al-Khawarij to attack Pakistanis,” he added.
 


The prime minister asserted that Pakistan had “always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”.
“As the world’s frontline state against terrorism, we have endured immense loss, with our 90,000 casualties and economic losses beyond imagination, exceeding $600 billion,” he highlighted.
“[…] we would not tolerate any kind of terrorism, of any hue and colour, and that has been demonstrated beyond any ray of doubt,” the premier added.
Khawaja Asif calls for international probe, warns of ‘all-out war’
PM Shehbaz’s statement comes a day after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the New York Times in an interview that Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” with “any investigation which is conducted by international inspectors”.
The minister said India had used the aftermath of the militant attack as a pretext to suspend the IWT and for domestic political purposes. India was taking steps to punish Pakistan “without any proof, without any investigation”, he added.
“We do not want this war to flare up, because flaring up of this war can cause disaster for this region,” Asif told the publication.
 
 

Asif rebutted India’s allegations by asserting that the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was “defunct” and had no ability to plan or conduct attacks from Pakistan.
“They don’t have any setup in Pakistan,” he told the NYT.
“Those people, whatever is left of them, they are contained. Some of them are under house arrest, some of them are in custody. They are not at all active,” the minister said.
According to NYT, Asif said the attack could have been a “false flag” operation carried out by the Indian government to provoke a crisis.
The defence minister asserted that for the last decade, India had been trying to get out of the treaty, which has been a source of stability in the region.
“They were creating excuses. They were creating problems that were not there,” he was quoted as saying. “They have now found an excuse to get out of this arrangement.”
In a separate interview with Sky News, Asif had warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
“If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” Asif said, adding that the world should be “worried” by the prospect of a full-scale military conflict in the region.
 


Fire exchange at LoC for 2nd day
As ties plummeted in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, there were reports of Indian and Pakistani troops exchanging gunfire for a second straight day on Saturday across the Line of Control (LoC).
Yesterday, Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, had told AFP that troops exchanged fire along the line separating the two countries. “There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.
There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms.
According to Reuters, the Indian army today claimed its troops responded to “unprovoked” small arms fire from multiple Pakistan Army posts that started around midnight on Friday along the 740-kilometre LoC.
No casualties were reported from the Indian side, it said.
UNSC slams Pahalgam attack, calls on members to cooperate
In a related development, the UN Security Council (UNSC) yesterday condemned “in the strongest terms the terrorist attack” in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
In a press release issued, UNSC President Jérôme Bonnafont stated: “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.”
The UNSC members underlined the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
 
 

They urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions, to “cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard”.
The UNSC reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed”.
Extending their condolences to the bereaved families, the members reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law.
The UNSC also released Pakistan’s statement issued after Wednesday’s NSC meeting, which detailed the country’s decisions taken in response to Indian measures, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to Bonnafont, the UNSC president for April, on Friday, according to APP.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the Agenda Item ‘India-Pakistan Question’,” Bonnafont was quoted as telling the UNSC.

“Unfortunately, at least four deaths have been confirmed by rescuers,” the head of the Red Crescent Society’s Relief and Rescue Organisation, Babak Mahmoudi, told state TV.
State television, citing emergency services, reported that “516 people have been injured as hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres” in the southern province of Hormozgan, where the Shahid Rajaee port is located.
The explosion was reported at around 12:30am local time (2100GMT/2am PKT) on Saturday.
The strategically important port, located in the southern Hormozgan province, lies around 15 kilometres southwest of the port of Bandar Abbas on the northern shore of the Strait of Hormuz.
 


The explosion was likely caused by poorly stored chemical materials detonating, according to Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management organisation.
“The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” he told Iran’s ILNA news agency. “Previously, the Director General of Crisis Management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger.”
The explosion occurred as Iran began a third round of nuclear talks with the United States in Oman, but there was no immediate indication of a link between the two events.
According to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, it could have been caused by the explosion of a fuel tank, however, there has been no official statement on it so far.
The report said rapid response teams were immediately dispatched to the site of the incident, with port operations suspended temporarily to allow security and emergency forces to restore order.
The semi-official Fars News Agency quoted local officials in Hormozgan as saying the explosion occurred at a section of the Shahid Rajaee Port dock, adding that efforts are underway to extinguish the fire.</p><small>2025-04-26 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26164136fcafa4d.jpg?r=164236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906702/pope-francis-funeral-draws-thousands-cardinal-says-his-legacy-must-survive' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Francis’ funeral draws thousands, cardinal says his legacy must survive</strong></a><br><p>Presidents, royalty and a multitude of simple mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at his funeral, where a cardinal said the pontiff’s legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment must not die with him.
On one side of Francis’ coffin in the vast St. Peter’s Square sat US President Donald Trump, who had clashed with the pope on those issues.
“Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today’s challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time,” said Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral Mass.
The Argentine pope, who had reigned for 12 years, died at the age of 88 on Monday after suffering a stroke.
The crowd, who crammed the square and the roads around, broke into applause when Re spoke of Francis’ care for immigrants, his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate.
They clapped loudly again at the end of the service when the ushers picked up the casket and tilted it slightly so more people could see, the church bells tolling in the background.
The coffin was placed on an open-topped popemobile and driven through the heart of Rome to St. Mary Major Basilica, with thousands of people lining the route.
Francis, who shunned much of the pomp and privilege of the papacy during his 12-year reign, had asked to be buried there rather than in the crypt of St. Peter’s, which is the traditional resting place for popes.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” one woman in the crowd shouted.
Aerial views of the Vatican during the funeral showed a patchwork of colours — black from the dark garb of the world’s leaders, red from the vestments of some 250 cardinals, the purple worn by some of the 400 bishops and the white worn by 4,000 attending priests.
Choirs sang Latin hymns and prayers were recited in various languages, including Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabic, reflecting the global reach of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church.
The Vatican estimated more than 250,000 people attended the ceremony, which lasted two hours.
Among the heads of state who flew into Rome were the presidents of the United States, Ukraine Argentina, France, Gabon, Germany, the Philippines and Poland, together with the prime ministers of Britain and New Zealand, and many royals, including the king and queen of Spain.

Francis’ death ushered in a meticulously planned period of transition, marked by ancient ritual, pomp and mourning. Over the past three days, around 250,000 people filed past his body, laid out before the altar of the cavernous basilica.
The faithful hurried to the Vatican from the early hours while many camped out to try to secure spots at the front of the crowd.
“When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre.
Breaking tradition
 
 

Francis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Roman Catholic Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change.
“Francis left everyone a wonderful testimony of humanity, of a holy life and of universal fatherhood,” said a formal summary of his papacy, written in Latin, and placed next to his body.
Traditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears.
The pope carried his desire for greater simplicity in the papacy into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously.
He also opted to forego a centuries-old practice of burying popes in three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin, which was sealed closed overnight.
In a further break with the past, he will be the first pope to be buried outside the Vatican in more than a century, preferring St. Mary Major, some 5.5 kilometres from St. Peter’s.
His tomb has just “Franciscus”, his name in Latin, inscribed on the top. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab.
Italy mounted one of the biggest security operations the country has seen since the funeral of John Paul II. It closed the airspace over the city and called in extra security forces, with anti-aircraft missiles and patrol boats guarding the event.
As soon as Francis is buried, attention will switch to who might succeed him.
The secretive conclave to elect a successor is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.</p><small>2025-04-26 11:45</small></div><hr>
