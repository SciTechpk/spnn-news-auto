• CM Gulbar says region lacks funds to tackle flood damage
• Seven districts affected; Diamer worst hit by daily flash floods
• Villagers flee Rajanpur, Bhakkar, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as low-lying districts in Punjab submerged
GILGIT / LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Gilgit-Balti­stan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Saturday appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7 billion in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters that have caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.
Speaking at a press conference at the CM House in Gilgit, the chief minister said the GB government lacks the financial capacity to handle the unprecedented disasters.
CM Khan was accompanied by GB Home Minister Shams Lone, GB Assembly member Jamil Ahmed, Special Assi­stant on Infor­mation Eman Shah and Special Assistant on GB Disaster Management Auth­ority Muhammad Ali Quaid.
He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.
He said that so far, 10 fatalities and four injuries have been reported. Seven deaths were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.
The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.
He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.
“I appeal to the prime minister of Pakistan to immediately release at least Rs7bn to restore roads, electricity, water channels and to undertake other essential relief efforts,” the chief minister said and requested the premier to visit the region.
He recalled that the federal government provided Rs3bn during the 2022 floods, but criticised the previous GB administration for misusing the funds, with the exception of a model village established for flood victims in Ghizer’s Bubor area.
“This year’s disasters are beyond our resources. I urge the federal government to help the people of GB,” he added, while also appealing to non-governmental and international organisations for support. A formal request has been sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said.
Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which was blocked at Chilas on Saturday, was reopened for traffic on Sunday. However, flash flood events continued to be reported across GB.
In Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat, a flash flood swept away over 200 goats, sheep and surrounding greenery. Rescue 1122 reported multiple flash floods in the Shigar district on Saturday, affecting crops and infrastructure in Qaimabad Tisar, Chatron and Garam Chashma.
 
 

Residents said flash floods disrupted road access, mobile networks and electricity. In Kondus village of Ghanche district, a devastating landslide destroyed over 50 homes. Survivors are in dire need of shelter, food, medical care and internet access.
Flood-affected communities in Diamer and elsewhere are facing severe shortages of clean drinking water and essential supplies.
Punjab grapples with flooding
Meanwhile, thousands of residents across several districts in Punjab were displaced on Saturday as widespread flooding inundated low-lying areas. In some regions, such as Rojhan tehsil of Rajanpur, residents resorted to hiring private boats after failing to receive government assistance.
Several villagers in Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan and Muzaffargarh also had to leave due to a medium-level flood. All their crops were damaged due to the flood, and their houses were also surrounded by water.
The hundreds of people living in the catchment areas of the rivers Sindh and Chenab also had to migrate on their own, along with their cattle, struggling to find fodder and shelter. They protested the government’s lack of relief efforts.
 
 

In Layyah, the third flood wave in the Indus River raised water levels to 450,000 cusecs. A protective embankment near the under-construction Taunsa Bridge collapsed, submerging adjacent villages and farmlands. Rescue machinery, including a multimillion-rupee excavator, was at risk of being lost.
Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Chaudhry Ashfaq told Dawn that the situation was under control and that the excavator would be recovered once the water receded. Relief camps have been set up in Karor tehsil of Layyah at several locations.
Meanwhile, Dera Ghazi Khan Deputy Com­missioner Usman Khalid said water levels were expected to remain stable by evening and noted that seven relief camps had been established in Taunsa. He confirmed that no mass evacuations had occurred yet.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb visited flood-hit areas in Pindi Bhattian and Hafizabad, where dozens of villages were submerged due to heavy rains. She met with residents, announced one-month rations for affected families and inspected medical and livestock camps.
She said a survey had been conducted to assess flood damage and pledged to provide financial assistance in a transparent manner. Emergency measures have been implemented in affected areas, with residents advised to relocate from dilapidated structures.
Earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab issued flood warnings for the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and their tributaries, anticipating rising water levels from July 28 to 31.
Punjab’s Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javed directed local officials and departments, including agriculture, irrigation, health, livestock and transport, to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency arrangements, including food, shelter and clean water, were in place.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia urged the public to follow safety advisories and cooperate with authorities during emergency evacuations. He assured that the government would provide full support to both people and their livestock.

Often what you watch affects you badly and scars your soul.
One such image is that of a woman surrounded by about a dozen men being escorted away from the SUV in which she was presumably brought to the rocky wilderness. A video recording shows her walking a few steps with amazing calm and poise — her back is towards the men — and then she stops.
Next a man raises a pistol, points it towards the back of her chador-draped head and fires several shots. Before collapsing under a hail of bullets, Bano Satakzai appeared to express no fear, no anxiety, no emotion; offered no reaction. Whether it was outright resignation at her fate, defiance or stoicism is difficult to say.
The incident happened several weeks ago in Degari, Balochistan, we are told, and only became public when the men who’d brought her there for a ‘karo kari’ (‘honour’ killing) posted a horrific video of her murder on social media. A man was also said to have been killed at the same spot, but only the woman’s murder was captured clearly on camera. Their crime was initially said to be a marriage of choice, invoking the family and tribe’s wrath.

Pakistan’s ‘vigour’ in prosecuting cases of crimes against women is another story.

But then, the Balochistan chief minister criticised the media and social media users for not doing proper ‘investigative journalism’ as the couple were not married. In fact, a tribal chief or jirga had found them guilty of having an extramarital affair and sentenced them to death. Despite this ‘clarification’, gratefully, Sarfaraz Bugti hastened to add nobody had the right to take their lives and he stood with the victims and would ensure justice was served.
 
 

While nobody said who took the man’s life, it was emphasised that the woman was killed by her own brother because she had dishonoured the family. Belatedly, the Balochistan government says it arrested 11 men involved but, given the conviction rate in crimes against women, one can be sure once media attention shifts, the matter could be brushed under the carpet as has happened many times in the past.
The killers made sure that the woman’s execution was recorded and shared later on social media. The man was killed too but the focus on the woman being killed seemed designed to serve as a warning to other women to never ‘step out of line’.
Yes, it all makes sense in the beautiful world we have created, where patriarchy reigns supreme. Crimes against women are by no means restricted only to our society; they are a worldwide phenomenon. However, Pakistan’s ‘vigour’ in prosecuting such cases is another story.
In Pakistan, the conviction rate for those prosecuted for ‘honour’ killings and rape, besides other gender-based cases of violence, stands at 0.5 per cent. Yes, I will repeat: half a per cent, which, in other words, means that 99.5pc of those perpetrating violence against women get away scot-free. Legislation and induction of women police officers to investigate/ prosecute such crimes is yet to show in the statistics. This percentage in this instance is from the over 32,000 recorded, registered cases in 2024. It’s safe to assume many more cases aren’t even reported or registered.
The truth is that even in the West, women are battered, even killed. They are known not to receive protection when their own partner, for example, is the transgressor. Institutional bias is often evidenced in such cases where women under threat are either not believed or are ignored and the authorities don’t do enough to prevent domestic violence, even if they spring into action after violent incidents.
In our case, the vulnerability of women is exacerbated by the utter and complete lack of interest of the law-enforcement machinery in not just stopping violent men, despite being alerted in instances, but also by the fact that after a crime is committed, the investigation and prosecution do not seem to be a priority either.
The result is whether it was Qandeel Baloch murdered by her own brother, who had no qualms living off his sister’s income but felt she dishonoured the family by becoming a bold social media star a few years ago; or the most recent blood-curdling torture and consequent death of a 19-year old woman, whose psychopath husband did unmentionable things to her; or earlier this year the brother who killed his two sisters because they’d married of their own choice — all victims are women.
Each instance is one of control and of repudiation of a woman as an equal, with rights identical to men. The world has moved in varying degrees to acknowledge legally and societally the equality of women, despite resistance from those long conditioned by patriarchy. We seem far behind as we speak.
Each report of gender-based violence or even discrimination pushes me deeper into despair. If half of our society is not prepared to relinquish control over the remaining half and embrace it as a diverse equal, imagine the collective intellectual and decision-making deficit that is created. This system has to be dismantled, torn down before we can build something better, more equal, fairer and saner.
 
 

I am reminded of John Lennon’s words: “You may say I am dreamer, but I am not the only one.” I wish I had Lennon’s optimism in saying I am not the only one, and that an equal, fairer society is indeed possible. And that men could be reformed to appreciate that patriarchy is a major impediment to our development and that women’s equality is a matter of right not something that owes to a man’s benevolence.
But every day we furnish evidence we are moving further and further away from being more inclusive. We appear determined to condemn ourselves to torment such as the one that the images from Degari brought us. Where can we realistically go from here?

• Governor bemoans Centre’s uplift measures focused on Punjab
PESHAWAR: A jirga organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital on Saturday rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga.
The gathering, which was attended by almost all major political parties, was held at Bacha Khan Markaz, followed by a press conference in which a 28-point declaration was read out by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar.
The jirga demanded an end to terrorism and the restoration of constitutional rights, as well as the protection of Pashtun rights. The declaration emphasised the need for a durable peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas through a political leadership-driven jirga to engage in “serious negotiations” with the military establishment. It demanded the full implementation of the 18th Amendment, an end to proxy wars, and the early restoration of the NFC Award.
 






It urged the government to eliminate all terrorist outfits in the province without any discrimination while also rejecting all forms of violence, including military operations. It agreed on the establishment of a peace process led by the political leadership to address the root causes of militancy. It also demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.
The jirga also demanded concrete steps to address enforced disappearances, internally-displaced persons’ problems, and the reconstruction of infrastructure damaged during multiple military operations. It said all missing persons should be produced in relevant courts to provide justice to the affected families. It further called for an end to proxy wars, neutral stance in international conflicts, and the strengthening of diplomatic relations with the neighbouring countries.
The jirga asked for the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) and the rollback of the Action in Aid of Civil Power 2019 to stop injustices. It also sought funds and facilities for the ex-Fata region as per the promises made by the federal government.
The gathering was attended by representatives from the ANP, the PML-N, the PPP, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, the Jamaat-i-Islami, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Qaumi Watan Party, the National Democratic Movement, the Pashtunkhwa Awami National Party, and the Mazdoor Kisan Party.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi told journalists at KP House in Islamabad that the Fata merger could not be rolled back without a constitutional amendment and sought funds for the region promised at the time of its integration. He also demanded that a tribal jirga be constituted to resolve the issues faced by these areas. The governor said that the situation in the province was “ser­­iously dangerous” as people were being kidnapped for ransom in broad-daylight.
He also criticised the federal government and said that its focus was only on the development of Punjab, saying that the KP youth had been ignored by the  government in its projects . He said the province lacked proper playgrounds, as a result of which the PSL matches could not be held in KP. He also claimed that the PTI founder, Imran Khan, would not come out of jail and his sons would not travel to Pakistan.
The jirga participants warned that they would march on Isla­mabad if their demands were not met.

Published in Dawn, July 27th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-27 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/688589b3a1c6d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926846/taming-militancy' target='_blank'><strong>Taming militancy</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN’S policy of mainstreaming militants has produced mixed results. While it has reduced the presence of militant networks within the country, these groups have not been entirely eliminated. Though no longer thriving, they remain active and continue to damage Pakistan’s international image.
When international pressure on Pakistan intensified in 2018, particularly through the FATF, the state establishment decided to restrict militant networks that were active in Indian-held Kashmir and the sectarian domains. A key component of this effort was the launch of rehabilitation and mainstreaming programmes targeting these groups.
For the reintegration of the Lashkar-e-Taiba/ Jamaatud Dawa and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) fighters, the establishment launched a multipronged policy. For the LeT/JuD, the creation of a political wing was a key component of this strategy. Despite reports of billions of rupees being spent on rehabilitation programmes, there is little transparency about who implemented them and what the outcomes were.
In this shifting landscape, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan has emerged as a replacement for the banned sectarian group Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, which, although still present, has largely lost its influence even within Deobandi madressahs, although it retains some residual potential. The TLP not only absorbed the SSP’s sectarian agenda but also adopted the anti-Ahmadi narrative of the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat movements, expanding and intensifying the reach of both.

Pakistan’s militancy landscape is changing rapidly, but credible initiatives are needed.

While the TLP has not engaged in violence to the extent of earlier anti-Shia militant groups, it presents a more insidious threat. It has succeeded in internalising hate within society, influencing public discourse and unsettling institutional mindsets across the country.
 
 

The LeT/JuD proposed a shift towards mainstream politics and attempted to enter electoral politics under various names, the most recent being the Markazi Muslim League (MML). The core idea behind this move was to capture the political space in Punjab that the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) had vacated, especially after it lost favour with the establishment.
Another idea floated during this time was to absorb the SSP into the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, but it did not work, as the SSP was divided and its leadership was unwilling to surrender their perks and privileges. Such ideas had little potential to work, as the major religious parties were also concerned about their image if the bulk of militants joined their parties.
 
 

While Pakistani authorities framed this shift as a strategy for the political mainstreaming of LeT/JuD and JeM, Indian policy circles and media interpreted it differently. They argued that this transformation aimed to ‘secularise’ militancy in Kashmir and pointed to the formation of The Resistance Front (TRF), allegedly linked to LeT, as part of this narrative.
It is unclear how far the militant credentials of LeT and JeM have been secularised. However, the shift in Pakistan’s policy towards militant groups has reduced the appeal and presence of Kashmiri militant outfits, including Hizbul Mujahideen, once a major jihadist group affiliated with the JI.
While this transformation was unfolding among Kashmir-based militant groups, two international terrorist organisations, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent and the Islamic State (IS), were competing to extend their networks in the region, particularly in India-held Kashmir.
Ironically, this transformation brought strategic advantages to both sides. For India, it curtailed the infiltration of global jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and IS into Kashmir. For Pakistan, it made it increasingly difficult for India to prove direct state links to militancy, thereby improving Pakistan’s international image. The recent US sanctions on the TRF appear to be a balancing act. Whether symbolic or genuine, these sanctions are unlikely to harm Pakistan’s interests significantly.
Internally, however, the experiment of managing militancy through sanctions and soft reintegration has produced mixed results. For instance, the PTI-led government, in coordination with the establishment, attempted a similar approach with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but it did not succeed. The recent wave of terrorism in KP is a result of that policy, which backfired.
 
 

As Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape evolves, the establishment has begun reflecting on its strategy towards militant groups. There appears to be a growing consensus within the state to further restrict the operational space available to these groups.
The JeM, in particular, is seen as a potential risk, as some of its factions and commanders defected to Al Qaeda and the TTP after 2004. Although its infrastructure has already been significantly weakened, it continues to pose a threat to internal security. The state has adopted a different approach towards the JeM; it does not have the potential to be converted into a political party, as it lacks the extensive networks of groups like the LeT/JuD. Nor does it have the vision or capacity to adopt a new path. It has been kept in the domain of charity to allow limited functions, driven by the fear that a complete dismantling would create internal security problems, pushing its fighters towards joining anti-Pakistan terrorist groups.
The LeT/JuD are also undergoing a phase of internal re-evaluation. The group appears divi­d­­ed: some elements advocate continued militancy, while others favour disengagement from armed struggle.
Pakistan’s militancy landscape is changing rapidly, but credible initiatives are needed. While the establishment has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards the TTP, Islamic State-Khorasan and Baloch insurgent groups, it must apply a similar approach to other forms of radical and militant outfits. Perhaps no reintegration plan is needed at this stage, as the potential of these groups has been exposed, and there would be little chance of backlash if the establishment were to disallow them from operating inside the country in any form.
When the MML takes to the streets to protest against Indian aggression, and TLP threatens judges or influences court decisions, while state institutions remain silent, it gives the impression to the world that the state either cannot deal with such groups or is not averse to allowing them space for survival. In such a scenario, the world also casts doubt on the state’s potential as a reliable partner in broader geopolitical and geo-economic designs.

The two sides appear ready to recalibrate their economic and strategic ties after years of diplomatic chill and disengagement.
The meeting between the top diplomats of the two countries is being widely interpreted as a formal culmination of a discreet thaw in bilateral ties — set in motion by the lunch President Donald Trump recently hosted for Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House. It would not be wrong to say that Mr Trump’s gesture helped lay the groundwork for the resumption of high-level diplomatic momentum between the two nations.
At Friday’s meeting, the two sides are said to have discussed several issues — trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation, critical minerals and mining, and the recent Pakistan-India clash, which the US president takes credit for stopping.
Indeed, Pakistan appears keen on securing continued US engagement in South Asia, particularly for help in the resolution of the long-standing Kashmir dispute. Yet, it is clear from Mr Dar’s remarks, following his meeting with Mr Rubio, that Islamabad is now prioritising a more durable economic partnership with Washington.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI and counterterrorism cooperation,” he posted on X. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, he revealed that a trade deal over the steep 29pc reciprocal tariffs imposed on Pakistan as part of President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs was “very close”.
“It’s not going to be months, not even weeks — I would say [just] days,” he said. Mr Rubio, for his part, said the discussions focused on expanding bilateral trade and advancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector — an area of growing strategic interest for both sides.
The US remains Pakistan’s single largest export destination, and American firms hold the biggest portfolio of fixed investment across key sectors of the country’s economy, underscoring the long-term strategic importance of enhanced trade and investment ties between the two nations.
That the latter appear willing to reset their ties around economic cooperation is encouraging and marks a departure from the days of security-centric engagements. It should lay the foundation for an enduring partnership. It must also be emphasised that the ongoing discussions over higher reciprocal tariffs afford policymakers a unique opportunity to build the future trajectory of bilateral ties on the basis of broader economic cooperation.
A partnership built on the long-term economic interests of the two countries should go a long way in deepening bilateral cooperation in other important areas, such as counterterrorism, as well.

• Barrister Gohar urges end to political exclusion
ISLAMABAD: As many as five Senators have submitted their affidavits to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, indicating their intention to officially join the party.
However, a sixth Senator — Murad Saeed — remains “missing.” According to party sources, his intimation regarding joining PTI may be received electronically.
PTI’s Information Secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking to Dawn, said that five Senators who were recently elected as independent candidates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have handed over their affidavits to Mr. Gohar.
“The affidavits will be submitted to the Election Commission of Pakis­tan (ECP) on Monday (tomorrow),” he said.
The Senators who submitted affidavits to join PTI include Azam Swati, Faisal Javed, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, and Robina Naz.
However, it is pertinent to mention that PTI stalwart Murad Saeed — who secured the highest number of votes on general seats — has not yet submitted his affidavit to Mr. Gohar.
According to party sources, the government is actively attempting to arrest Murad Saeed, who has been in hiding for a considerable period. As a result, his affidavit might be delayed or submitted electronically.
When contacted, Azam Swati told Dawn that he and the other candidates had made every effort to obtain official PTI tickets but were denied.
“In my case, my nomination papers were rejected multiple times and were only accepted following a court order, which remarked: ‘If Azam Swati cannot contest the election on a technocrat seat, then who can?’ As we did not have party tickets, we formed a group of six independent candidates and went on to win the election,” he said.
In response to another question, Mr Swati confirmed that he and the other four Senators had submitted their affidavits to Barrister Gohar on July 23.
He expressed confidence that the affidavits would be submitted to the ECP, as rules require Senators to formally join a political party within three days of the election.
Hammad Azhar to contest by-polls
Meanwhile, PTI plans to nominate the party’s former Punjab president, Hammad Azhar, to contest the by-election from NA-129— the constituency where his late father, Mian Muhammad Azhar, was elected in the February 8, 2024, general elections.
It is worth mentioning that Hammad Azhar was also elected as an MNA from the same constituency in the 2018 general elections.
Last year, Mian Azhar had contested the election because Hammad Azhar failed to submit his nomination papers.
At the time, the younger Azhar had been declared an absconder, although he later attended his father’s funeral.
‘Not a good omen’
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan has stated that sidelining a major political party is not a good omen for the country, stressing that every stakeholder must play a role in upholding democracy.
He made these remarks on Friday after visiting Hammad Azhar’s residence to offer condolences on the passing of his father, Mian Azhar, former Punjab governor and PTI MNA.
While acknowledging that the dialogue process has not progressed, Mr Gohar said that people need to put aside their unwarranted egos. He lamented that PTI was first accused of rec­eiving foreign funding and later blamed for the country’s current political instability. He made it clear that PTI has never attempted to create chaos or provoke confrontations in politics.

Police produced Gul Jan Bibi before Judge Muhammad Ali Mobeen of the ATC-I after the expiry of her two-day physical remand and the investigation officer informed the court that she was not required for further investigation.
After the initial arguments from both sides, the jud­ge sent the woman on judicial remand.
Gul Jan Bibi was arrested after her video statement went viral, in which she defended the killing of her daughter, Bano Bibi, and a man in the name of ‘honour’ in Dagari, on the outskirts of Quetta.
“They were killed according to the Baloch traditions and customs and we have not committed any sin by killing them,” Gul Jan Bibi said about the incident that shook the nation after videos of a group of men shooting the victims surfaced online earlier this month.
So far, around 15 people, including the tribal chief of Satakzai tribe, Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai, have been arrested. However, the prime accused, Jalal Satakzai, who allegedly opened fire and killed his elder sister, and the man, could not be arrested.
Protest
Meanwhile, human rights organisations and civil society staged a protest on Saturday to condemn the killings.
The protest was jointly organised by the Women Action Forum, National Commission on Human Rights, HRCP and Bol Utho Group.
A large number of human rights activists and members of civil society gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club. They took out a rally led by rights activists Prof Farkhanda Auran­g­zeb, Huma Fouladi, Seema Batool, Hameeda Noor and others.
The protesters condemned the incident and said honour killings were an intolerable act.
They demanded that all those involved in this crime be brought to justice.
“Nobody has the right to take law in his hand and kill people in the name of so-called honour,” Ms Aurangzeb said.
The protesters urged the government to protect women from such atrocities.

FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. He spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had drawn a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”. Furthermore, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, following the due process of law. “When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
FM Dar’s remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being “idiotic”.
Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: “Yesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan’s case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.”
He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.
“Our government’s stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release is clear and unequivocal.”
 






Responding to Dar’s comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said: “Sorry but this is idiotic! ‘Due process’ does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied & it was all false. That’s called a miscarriage of justice not what’s ‘due’.”
 






Dar “appeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia’s case yesterday by acting like she got ‘due process’ when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan”, he said in a separate post on X.
 






Speaking to Dawn.com, Smith said: “As you may have seen from the deputy PM’s statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case — saying her case is a result of ‘due process of law’ in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.
“He goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, which should be done through the courts.”
Smith said that in his opinion, “I suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia’s case, I tried to do that through the clemency process with Biden too.”
He said that FM Dar’s analogy was “unwise as well as misplaced”.
On the PTI founder’s incarceration and legal troubles, he said: “I suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‘due process of law’ in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‘due process’.”
He added that FM Dar should not talk about Dr Aafia’s case in the context of Imran’s cases.
“In every instance, Pakistan’s officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,” Aafia’s lawyer added.
He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia’s release.
Speaking on the circumstances of her trial, Smith said: “The defence brought no witnesses to New York, not one.
“The prosecution brought the people they wanted — soldiers who all tried unsuccessfully to tell the same story, and an Afghan interpreter who was promised US residency and given a substantial amount of money.”
He said that the physical evidence solidly disproved the prosecution’s theory, even then, but before trial, the defence did not locate the videotape that proved beyond argument that the holes in the wall were not from Dr Aafia shooting, since they were from earlier that day.
“I have promised to file her appeal in New York in the next week or ten days,” Smith said.
A day ago, PM Shehbaz had assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.
On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.
However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.
In February, the IHC was told that the proposal to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.
Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had requested that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.
In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.
“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”
Consequently, the US State Department declined to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p><small>2025-07-27 03:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/68856a416fe42.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926814/un-conference-eyes-solution-to-gaza-deadlock' target='_blank'><strong>UN conference eyes solution to Gaza deadlock</strong></a><br><p>• New York meeting to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia next week
• Israel and US to skip conference; 11 more Palestinians killed
• UK plans to airdrop aid, evacuate injured children from Gaza
UNITED NATIONS: Fired by France’s imminent recognition of Palestinian statehood, UN members meet next week to breathe life into the push for a two-state solution as Israel, expected to be absent, presses its war in Gaza.
Days before the July 28-30 conference on fostering Israeli and Palestinian states living peacefully side-by-side to be co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would formally recognise the State of Palestine in September.
His declaration “will breathe new life into a conference that seemed destined to irrelevance,” said Richard Gowan, an analyst at International Crisis Group.
“Macron’s announcement changes the game. Other participants will be scrabbling to decide if they should also declare an intent to recognise Palestine.” According to an AFP database, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states —including France — now recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed by the Palestinian leadership in exile in 1988.
The New York conference is a response to the crisis, with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa and several dozen ministers from around the world expected to attend.
‘No alternative’
The meeting comes as a two-state solution is “more threatened than it has ever been (but) even more necessary than before, because we see very clearly that there is no alternative,” said a French diplomatic source.
Beyond facilitating conditions for recognition of a Palestinian state, the meeting will have three other focuses — reform of the Palestinian Authority, disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from Palestinian public life, and normalisation of relations with Israel by Arab states that have not yet done so.
Ahead of the conference, Britain said it would not recognise a Palestinian state unilaterally and would wait for “a wider plan” for peace in the region.
Macron has also not yet persuaded Germany to follow suit and recognise a Palestinian state in the short term.
The conference “offers a unique opportunity to transform international law and the international consensus into an achievable plan and to demonstrate resolve to end the occupation and conflict once and for all, for the benefit of all peoples,” said the Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour.
Israel and the United States will not take part in the meeting.
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli operations killed 11 people including four Palestinians in the Al-Rimal neighbourhood. Another person was killed “after Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for humanitarian aid” northwest of Gaza City, the agency said.
Witnesses said several thousand people had gathered in the area for aid. Another man was killed by a drone strike near the southern city of Khan Yunis, while one was killed by artillery fire in the Al-Bureij camp, the civil defence said.
UK to airdrop Gaza aid
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday spoke to his French and German counterparts and outlined UK plans to get aid to people in Gaza and evacuate sick and injured children, his office said.
“The prime minister set out how the UK will also be taking forward plans to work with partners such as Jordan to airdrop aid and evacuate children requiring medical assistance,” a statement said.
In a phone conversation, Starmer, Fre­nch President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza “which they agreed is appalling”.
“They all agreed it would be vital to ensure robust plans are in place to turn an urgently needed ceasefire into lasting peace,” according to a readout released by Downing Street.
Handala near Gaza shores
Meanwhile, the activist group Freedom Flotilla announced that its latest aid boat dispatched to Gaza was approaching the territory and planned to land there on Sunday morning in defiance of an Israeli blockade.
The vessel, named the Handala after a popular Palestinian cartoon character, was 194km from its destination, organisers said — closer to Gaza than its predecessor the Madleen was when it was intercepted in June.
Carrying 19 activists, including Swed­ish activist Greta Thunberg, as well as two journalists from different countries, the  Handala first set sail from Sicily on July 13 in a bid to break the  Israeli blockade on Gaza and deliver aid to its population. However, the Israeli navy said it would block the new vessel from reaching Palestine.

The premier was chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms in Islamabad on Saturday.
He directed the FBR to continue dialogue with the business community over tax compliance concerns, emphasising that any form of harassment will not be tolerated.
The government, he stated, remains committed to creating a facilitative environment for businesses across the country. The directive comes amid mounting tensions, as trade associations have announced a nationwide strike in response to budgetary tax measures aimed at documenting the retail sector and curbing tax evasion.
An official source told Dawn that the prime minister has directed senior FBR officials to ensure that no member of the business community is subjected to harassment. “We have to keep businesses running,” he stated, adding that any coercive actions against traders would be unacceptable. “We do not want to close businesses,” he said.
Mr Shehbaz further emphasised that the FBR should rely on digital surveillance rather than physical crackdowns to identify tax evaders. “Utilise technology to detect tax evasion and then issue recovery notices,” the prime minister instructed.
The FBR has deployed tax officials across 10 key sectors — including ghee, tobacco, and sugar — to monitor actual production and detect instan­ces of concealment. Section 40B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 authorises the FBR to station officers directly at business premises for this purpose.
To ensure transparency, FBR personnel are accompanied by representatives from the Intelligence Bureau and other relevant agencies.
Preliminary findings indicate that certain sectors have been deliberately underreporting production in order to evade taxes.
The prime minister has underscored the need for equitable tax contributions across all segments of the economy. Expressing concern over the narrow focus of current tax collection efforts — primarily targeting the manufacturing sector and salaried individuals — he termed the approach as unjust.
He directed that high-net-worth individuals, retailers, wholesalers, and other economic actors be brought under the tax net to ensure a broader and fairer revenue base.
“The tax collection process must be rational and efficient so that we reduce reliance on domestic taxation,” the premier stated, emphasising that every sector carries a responsibility to contribute its fair share to the national exchequer.
According to the tax official, the issues with traders are expected to be resolved by the coming Monday.
“We have addressed most concerns and reached an understanding,” the official stated, adding that the remaining issues will be settled during the final round of negotiations.

• Aleema claims jail authorities denied lawyers entry to plead Toshakhana case
ISLAMABAD: PTI founding chairman and ex-premier Imran Khan has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the rejection of his bail by lower courts.
On June 24, the Lahore High Court (LHC) denied post-arrest bail to the incarcerated PTI leader in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including an attack on the house of Lahore corps commander. Mr Khan had moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court denied bail to the former prime minister in these eight cases.
The petition, filed through senior counsel Salman Safdar on Saturday, claimed Mr Khan has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
However, at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Khan was in the custody of NAB. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible,” the petition argued.
The appeal was filed a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema, accused the Adiala jail authorities of trying to sabotage the case by confiscating documents required to submit the petition.
The fresh appeal contended the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister two years ago.
The present case is yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” Mr Khan in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment”.
The prosecution has no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged occurrence, the petition claimed.
After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” arrest from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, the petition contended, adding none of these complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.
At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan.
If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the petition questioned.
This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”.
The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.
Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, the petition pleaded.
It added the police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months after his bail applications were dismissed by an Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore on Aug 11, 2023.
Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”.
“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the petition said.
LHC decision
The petition claimed the LHC declined Mr Khan’s request for post-arrest bail by relying on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
The high court also failed to note the prosecution had been “consistently shifting its stance” by continually changing the case’s narrative.
“Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry.”
These contradictions clearly make a case for Mr Khan to be granted bail under Section 497(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The said section, which allows bail in non-bailable offences, states: “If it appears to such officer or Court … that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed [a non-bailable offence], but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall, pending such inquiry, be released on bail…”.
Legal team denied entry
Also on Saturday, Ms Aleema, the PTI founder’s sister, claimed his legal team was not allowed inside the Adiala Jail to attend the proceedings of the Toshakhana 2 case.
While talking to reporters outside the prison, Ms Aleema said she and the lawyers were waiting but neither was allowed to enter the prison.
“We were told that only one lawyer can go inside the jail but the lawyer asked how he would [plead the case] without his legal team,” Ms Aleema said.
She claimed the jail authorities violated the judge’s orders, who “time and again said the lawyers of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be allowed to enter”.
Ms Aleema said no one was listening to judges “because of the 26th Constitutional Amendment”.
She added her brother has already given a call to launch a protest campaign and raise a voice against the amendment.

According to Swat police, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of high-profile militants in the area. When law enforcement personnel moved in, the suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. All three militants were killed in the ensuing exchange.
Among the deceased was Ajmal alias Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad, wanted in at least nine terrorism-related cases. The second was identified as Matiullah alias Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, wanted in two cases.
The third, Rahimullah Rehmani alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah and a resident of Sheray, Nuristan, in Afghanistan, was also wanted in two separate terrorism cases.
Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan told reporters that search and strike operations would continue across the district.
He added that security had been intensified at all entry and exit points to prevent the infiltration of miscreants. “We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” he said.
Militant killed by own accomplices
In a separate incident in Kohat district, an alleged militant involved in an earlier attack on the Hangu DPO was killed on Friday night, reportedly by fire from his own group during a police operation.
 
 

The militant, identified as Shahzeb, had previously escaped after being injured during an attack on the Hangu DPO’s convoy last Saturday. DPO Khalid Khan and SHO Nabi Khan were injured in the attack. Shahzeb was later arrested near Naryab Dam within the Doaba police jurisdiction.
During interrogation, he revealed the presence of militant commander Umer alias Abu Bakr in the area. Acting on this intelligence, police from Doaba and Thall tehsils launched an operation towards Tora Warai, where they were again ambushed.
SHO Doaba Imranud Din, who was transferred from Kohat a few days ago, and his team engaged the militants in a two-hour gun battle. During the exchange, Shahzeb was fatally struck by a bullet allegedly fired by his accomplices.
Karak operation
In Karak, an alleged militant was killed during an exchange of fire with police in the Shah Slaim area on Saturday.
A police official said a team assisted by CTD commandos was dispatched after intelligence reports indicated that a group of militants was heading towards the Abbas Khattak area in Lakki Marwat district.
During a search operation in Shah Slaim, security forces encountered the group, resulting in a fierce gun battle.
“The gunfight continued for some time before the terrorists fled into difficult mountainous terrain,” he claimed.
During the subsequent search, police recovered the body of a militant identified as Fidaullah, a resident of Nagri.
“The cops also seized an assault rifle, two hand grenades, magazines and ammunition from the place and shifted the terrorist’s body to a nearby hospital,” the police official added.
The official said that the killed militant was involved in various sabotage activities, including the Friday’s militant attack in the Koh-i-Maidan area in which a police constable Saeed Nawaz was martyred.
He said that police also destroyed the hideouts of militants in a separate action.
“The police, with the help of CTD personnel, launched a search and strike operation against the gang of terrorists led by Sanaullah Jalali and Attaullah,” he maintained, claiming that the group has been involved in launching attacks on law enforcement personnel in the Karak district.
He said that, along with destroying safe havens in the mountains, the law enforcers also cut off the supply line of the militants.

The trial, held from July 7 to 9, resulted in the judgment by Justice Heather Williams DBE, who convicted Abrar Qureshi of libel over two defamatory videos of his popular ‘Gorakh Dhanda’ programme published online on November 1, 2021 via different social media platforms. 
PPP regional president and MLA Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin and his son Chaudhry Amar Yasin, an AJK cabinet member, had brought the case in the King’s Bench Division of the High Court, citing severe harm to their political and personal reputations. 
The videos featured Mr Qureshi’s interview with Chaudhry Muhammad Sabeel, a former employee of the elder Yasin, who levelled accusations of criminal misconduct, including blackmail, sexual abuse, torture, corruption, and abuse of public office. 

Abrar Qureshi ordered not to publish defamatory videos again, share court order on his social media accounts

The court concluded that Mr Qureshi had made no reasonable attempt to verify the allegations before broadcasting them to a large audience. 
In her 62-page ruling, a copy of which was seen by Dawn, Justice Williams noted that Mr Qureshi had abandoned his defences of truth and honest opinion on the first day of trial, leaving him unable to justify the defamatory publications under public interest protections 
She found that Mr Qureshi had “fallen well short of the standards expected of a responsible journalist,” particularly given the size and influence of his platform, which includes over 190,000 YouTube subscribers and 700,000 Facebook followers. 
The judge said his failure to present Yasin family’s version of events or conduct basic checks made the publication grossly irresponsible.
The judge observed that the allegations had caused “serious harm” to the claimants’ personal and professional standing, especially considering their public roles within Pakistan and the Kashmiri diaspora in the UK. The tone of authority, repetition, and lack of challenge in the videos had led many viewers to believe the accusations were true, she added. 
While acknowledging that the claimants may have overstated the extent of reputational harm during parts of their testimony, the court was satisfied that the legal threshold of serious harm had been crossed by a wide margin. 
“As a remedy, each claimant was awarded £130,000 in libel damages, including aggravated damages to reflect the distress and reputational damage caused. Additionally, the defendant was ordered to pay interest of £21,829 to each claimant and an interim payment of £65,000 towards legal costs by August 8.”
The court issued a permanent injunction restraining Mr Qureshi from republishing the defamatory material or anything similar and directed him to post a court-approved summary of the judgment across all his social media platforms within seven days, as per Section 12 of the UK Defamation Act 2013.
Legal experts say the ruling underscored the limits of free expression on digital platforms, particularly where reputations are damaged in foreign nations. It also highlighted the strength of UK libel law, even in a cross-jurisdictional and digital media context.
Speaking briefly in Muzaffarabad after the verdict, Mr Yasin said: “We welcome the judgment as a vindication of truth and accountability.”

But the Republican’s well-worn methods of changing the subject when a tough topic stings politically are not working as his White House fends off persistent unrest from his usually loyal base about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.
Trump has scolded reporters, claimed ignorance and offered distractions in an effort to quash questions about Epstein and the suspicions still swirling around the disgraced financier’s case years after his 2019 death in prison. The demand for answers has only grown.
“For a president and an administration that’s very good at controlling a narrative, this is one that’s been harder,” said Republican strategist Erin Maguire, a former Trump campaign spokeswoman.
 
 

Unlike political crises that dogged Trump’s first term, including two impeachments and a probe into alleged campaign collusion with Russia, the people propelling the push for more transparency on Epstein have largely been his supporters, not his political foes.
Trump has fed his base with conspiracy theories for years, including the false “birther” claim that former president Barack Obama was not born in the US. Trump’s advisers fanned conspiracies about Epstein, too, only to declare them moot upon entering office.
That has not gone over well with the president’s right-leaning base, which has long believed the government was covering up Epstein’s ties to the rich and powerful.
“Donald Trump’s been running a Ponzi scheme based on propaganda for the better part of a decade, and it’s finally catching up to him,” said Geoff Duncan, a Republican former lieutenant governor of Georgia and Trump critic.
“The far right element is just dug in. They’re hell bent on getting this information out.”
The White House has dismissed reporting about Trump’s ties to Epstein as “fake news”, though it has acknowledged his name appears in documents related to the Epstein case. Trump and Epstein were friends for years before falling out.
“The only people who can’t seem to shake this story from their one-track minds are the media and Democrats,” said White House spokesman Harrison Fields.
Before leaving for a trip to Scotland on Friday, the president again urged people to turn their attention elsewhere.
“People should really focus on how well the country is doing,” Trump told reporters, lamenting that scrutiny was not being given to others in Epstein’s orbit.
“They don’t talk about them, they talk about me. I have nothing to do with the guy.”
The art of distraction
Trump, in recent weeks, has employed a typical diversion playbook.
He chastised a reporter for asking about Epstein in the White House Cabinet Room. He claimed in the Oval Office that he was not paying close attention to the issue. And, with help from Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, he explosively accused Obama of treason for how he treated intelligence in 2016 about Russian interference in the US election.
On Thursday, Trump took his distraction tour to the Federal Reserve, where he tussled with Chair Jerome Powell about construction costs and pressed for lower interest rates.
That, said Republican strategist Brad Todd, was more effective than focusing on Obama in 2016, which voters had already litigated by putting Trump back in office.
“The Tulsi Gabbard look backward, I think, is not the way for them to pivot,” Todd said, noting that Trump’s trip to the Fed highlighted the issue of economic affordability and taking on a Washington institution. “If I was him I’d go to the Fed every day until rates are cut.”
Democrats have seized on Trump’s efforts to move on, sensing a political weakness for the president and divisions in the Republican Party that they can exploit while their own political stock is low in the wake of last year’s drubbing at the polls.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month showed most Americans think Trump’s administration is hiding information about Epstein, creating an opportunity for Democrats to press.
 
 

Trump’s supporters and many Democrats are eager to see a release of government files related to Epstein and his case, which the Justice Department initially promised to deliver.
“Yesterday was another example of the Trump folks trying to throw as much stuff against the wall to avoid the Epstein files,” Mark Warner, a Democratic US senator from Virginia, said in a post on X on Thursday about Gabbard’s accusations against Obama.
 






Trump allies see the administration’s efforts to change topic as a normal part of an all-out-there strategy.
“They are always going at 100 miles an hour. Every department, every cabinet secretary, everybody is out there at full speed blanketing the area with news,” Republican strategist Maguire said.
Trump has weathered tougher periods before, and his conservative base, despite its frustration over the files, is largely pleased with Trump’s work on immigration and the economy. In a July Reuters/Ipsos poll, 56 per cent of Republican respondents favoured the administration’s immigration workplace raids, while 24pc were opposed and 20pc unsure.
Pollster Frank Luntz noted that Trump had faced felony convictions and other criminal charges but still won re-election last year.
“We’ve been in this very same situation several times before and he has escaped every time,” Luntz said.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2617220985fe334.png?r=172216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926722/rawalpindi-court-sends-3-suspects-on-physical-remand-in-alleged-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi court sends 3 suspects on physical remand in alleged honour killing case</strong></a><br><p>A court in Rawalpindi on Saturday remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and honour killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated. As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
Three of the total suspects were present in the court of Magistrate Qamar Abbas Tarar today, according to a court order seen by Dawn.com.
The judge approved the investigation officer’s (IO) request for custody, stating: “… Three-day physical remand of the accused for said purpose is hereby granted. Accused persons be produced before the court on July 29.”
In another order from today, the judge approved the application to conduct the exhumation of the victim’s body and scheduled it for July 28 at 10am. The judge directed the Holy Family Hospital’s medical superintendent to depute a medical officer who would arrive at the graveyard for the exhumation and also order the Pirwadhai Police station house officer to designate a guard at the victim’s grave until the exhumation.
The Rawalpindi tehsil medical officer was also instructed to provide sanitary workers for the process.
Separately, the police added Sections 109 (abetment), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (murder) and 311  (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code to the FIR on Friday.
City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani also told Dawn.com that a 10-member team was formed to assist in the investigation.
He said the team included various senior police officials further and IT experts of Rawalpindi Police, who would ensure timely support and the provision of technical evidence to the investigation officer from various institutions.
Hamdani said that the team would also conduct raids to ensure the timely arrest of more suspects in the light of information obtained from those detained during the investigation.
The incident comes a few days after  police arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Degari area of Balochistan’s Quetta, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/262139145dd857f.jpg?r=214005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/trump-says-thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-hold-immediate-ceasefire-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Thailand and Cambodia agree to hold immediate ceasefire talks</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the leaders of Cambodia and Thailand had agreed to meet immediately to quickly work out a ceasefire, as he sought to broker peace after three days of fighting along their border left at least 33 people dead.
In a series of social media posts during a visit to Scotland, Trump said he had spoken to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, warning them that he would not make trade deals with either of their governments if the border conflict continued.
Following calls for restraint on both sides from Trump’s senior aides, he became directly involved on Saturday, speaking to each leader and saying he relayed messages back and forth.
“Just spoke to the prime minister of Cambodia relative to stopping the war with Thailand,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.
“I have just spoken to the acting prime minister of Thailand, and it was a very good conversation,” he said soon after in a new post. “Thailand, like Cambodia, wants to have an immediate ceasefire and peace.
“I am now going to relay that message back to the prime minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both parties, [a] ceasefire, peace, and prosperity seems to be a natural”
 


“They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a ceasefire and, ultimately, peace!” Trump wrote later, saying both countries wanted to get back to the “Trading Table”.
He has sought to reach separate deals with dozens of countries in response to his announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on imports to the US.
“When all is done, and Peace is at hand, I look forward to concluding our Trading Agreements with both!” Trump said.
He offered no details on the ceasefire negotiations he said Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to hold.
The Thai and Cambodian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thailand and Cambodia clashed for a third day today, as the death toll from their bloodiest fighting in years rose to 33 and Phnom Penh called for an “immediate ceasefire”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into intense conflict involving jets, artillery, tanks and ground troops on Thursday, prompting the UN Security Council (UNSC) to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Friday.
“I am trying to simplify a complex situation! Many people are being killed in this war, but it very much reminds me of the conflict between Pakistan and India, which was brought to a successful halt,” Trump said.
Trump also indicated he would not move forward on trade deals with either nation until fighting has stopped.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said 13 people were now confirmed killed in the fighting, including eight civilians and five soldiers, with 71 people wounded.
In Thailand, the army said five soldiers were killed on Friday, taking the toll there to 20 — 14 civilians and six military.
The death toll across the two countries is now higher than the 28 killed in the last major round of fighting between 2008 and 2011.
Both sides reported a clash around 5am (3am PKT), with Cambodia accusing Thai forces of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into locations in Pursat province, which borders Thailand’s Trat province.
 
 

The fighting has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, with more than 35,000 driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After the closed meeting of the UNSC in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted a ceasefire.
“Cambodia asked for an immediate ceasefire — unconditionally — and we also call for the peaceful solution of the dispute,” he told reporters.
Border row
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said on Friday, before the UN meeting was held, that Bangkok was open to talks, possibly aided by Malaysia.
“We are ready, if Cambodia would like to settle this matter via diplomatic channels, bilaterally, or even through Malaysia, we are ready to do that. But so far we have not had any response,” Nikorndej told AFP.
Malaysia currently holds the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, of which Thailand and Cambodia are both members.
Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has warned that if the situation escalates, “it could develop into war”.
Both sides blamed each other for firing first, while Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket.
Cambodia has accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions.
At the UN, Cambodia’s envoy questioned Thailand’s assertion that his country, which is smaller and less militarily developed than its neighbour, had initiated the conflict.
“[The Security Council] called for both parties to [show] maximum restraint and resort to a diplomatic solution. That is what we are calling for as well,” said Chhea Keo.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours — both popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists — over their shared 800-kilometre border.
Dozens of kilometres in several areas are contested and fighting broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.
A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the matter for over a decade, but the current crisis erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a new clash.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2621591124e1bb3.jpg?r=220657' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926753/thousands-rally-in-malaysia-to-call-for-pm-anwars-resignation' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands rally in Malaysia to call for PM Anwar’s resignation</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people rallied in the Malaysian capital on Saturday to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as public discontent grows over rising living costs and allegations of failing to deliver promised reforms.
Protesters — mostly wearing black t-shirts and bandannas carrying the slogan “Turun Anwar”, or “Step Down Anwar” — marched through the heart of Kuala Lumpur, before converging in the city’s Independence Square to hear speeches by top opposition leaders.
Police estimated at least 18,000 were in attendance.
Anwar, who campaigned on a reformist platform before taking office in November 2022, has faced criticism over measures aimed at boosting government revenue, including an expanded sales and services tax and subsidy adjustments that some fear could lead to a spike in consumer prices.
The premier this week announced a cash handout, increased aid for poor households and a pledge to lower fuel prices, in a bid to quell worries over rising costs.
Protester Nur Shahirah Leman, 23, a member of an Islamic students’ group, said she was worried that new taxes as well as higher electricity tariffs imposed on large businesses would eventually be passed down to consumers.
“These taxes are levied on manufacturers, so it would automatically affect the prices of food,” she said.
Anwar has also faced claims of judicial interference and doubts over his commitment to anti-corruption efforts, after prosecutors dropped graft charges against several figures allied to the government and following a recent delay in the appointment of the country’s top judges.
Anwar has repeatedly denied interfering in the courts.
Former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who turned 100 this month, joined the rally and accused Anwar of misusing his position to prosecute political rivals, charges the premier has previously rejected.
“Those who are innocent are charged, those who have done wrong are let go,” Mahathir told the crowd. Mahathir and Anwar, his former protégé-turned-rival, have been locked in an intense feud that has dominated Malaysian politics for nearly three decades.
The pair mended fences to oust the long-ruling Barisan Nasional government in 2018, but their coalition collapsed in less than two years amid infighting.</p><small>2025-07-26 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26183805bdcf04b.jpg?r=184217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926741/pakistan-fully-committed-to-building-secure-prosperous-regional-environment-with-allies-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment with allies: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir met Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.
“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.
The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.
“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.
 






According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.
The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.
“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.
It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”
Pakistan’s role in regional peace was lauded by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.
Govt honours US Centcom chief with Nishan-i-Imtiaz
Separately, the government conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) award upon Army General Michael Kurilla, Commander of United States Central Command (Centcom), “in recognition of his exemplary service and pivotal role in advancing enduring military cooperation between Pakistan and the United States”, the ISPR announced in a statement.
In a formal ceremony held at the Presidency, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred the decoration upon Gen Kurilla, acknowledging his contributions to regional security and his efforts in bolstering strategic defence ties between Islamabad and Washington. Upon his arrival, the Centcom chief was presented with a guard of honour.
“General Kurilla’s visionary leadership has been instrumental in fostering mutual understanding, enhancing defence collaboration, and deepening counterterrorism cooperation between the Pakistan Armed Forces and Centcom,” the statement read.
“His consistent engagement reflects a profound respect for Pakistan’s central role in promoting peace and stability across the region.”

According to the ISPR, conferring the award represented the “deep appreciation for Gen Kurilla’s unwavering support” and affirmed the depth of Pakistan and the US’ strategic ties.
The statement added that Gen Kurilla held detailed meetings with senior Pakistani civil and military leadership, including the president and COAS. Regional security, military-to-military engagement and joint efforts to combat terrorism were among the topics discussed.
“This high-level recognition underscores the enduring strategic relationship between Pakistan and the United States and reaffirms their shared commitment to regional peace, security and long-term defence cooperation,” the ISPR stated.

In a post on X, he said: “I am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.”
 






Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.
 






Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.
The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman’s confirmation came after the tournament was already expected to be hosted in the UAE.
The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.
The decision followed the ACC’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), held in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially threatening to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.
 
 

The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month.
In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.
During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.
Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.
With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other’s soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.
The UAE, having previously hosted the tournament in similar circumstances, emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26191704db4a885.jpg?r=191942' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926743/nasa-says-it-will-lose-about-20pc-of-its-workforce' target='_blank'><strong>Nasa says it will lose about 20pc of its workforce</strong></a><br><p>The United States space agency Nasa will lose about 3,900 employees under President Donald Trump’s sweeping effort to trim the federal workforce, at the same time as he prioritises plans for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.
In an emailed statement, Nasa said around 3,000 employees took part in the second round of its deferred resignation programme, which closed late on Friday.
Combined with the 870 who joined the first round and regular staff departures, the agency’s civil servant workforce is set to drop from more than 18,000 before Trump took office in January to roughly 14,000 — a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
Those leaving Nasa on the deferred resignation programme will be placed on administrative leave until an agreed departure date. An agency spokesperson said the figures could shift slightly in the coming weeks.
“Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organisation and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a golden era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,” the agency said.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s proposed Nasa budget put a return to the Moon and a journey to Mars front and centre, slashing science and climate programmes.
The White House says it wants to focus on “beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars”.
China is aiming for its first crewed lunar landing by 2030, while the US programme, called Artemis, has faced repeated delays.
Nasa is still run by an acting administrator after the administration’s initial pick to lead the agency, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman — endorsed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk — was ultimately rejected by the Republican president.</p><small>2025-07-26 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26190032a33acb5.jpg?r=190524' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926677/retreat-from-justice' target='_blank'><strong>Retreat from justice</strong></a><br><p>IT is a worrying development. The Islamabad High Court has decided to put on hold an earlier ruling asking the government to form a commission to look into the misuse of blasphemy laws.
The earlier judgement by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had come after months of hearings in which submissions were made indicating a pattern of entrapment, custodial abuse and investigative lapses in hundreds of online blasphemy cases. The court had rightly concluded that the matter was of public interest, and that the formation of a fact-finding commission was both urgent and necessary.
That initiative now hangs in the balance. The division bench’s decision to put the single-bench order on hold, citing jurisdictional and procedural concerns, may be legally arguable, but the consequences of inaction are far more grave. Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, often misused as tools of vengeance and coercion, have cost lives, ruined reputations and undermined public faith in the justice system.
The court had been presented with serious concerns: reused social media accounts, unverified digital evidence, private arrests and four reported custodial deaths, including one caught on video. These are not routine procedural flaws — they are red flags demanding scrutiny.
The original petition had been strengthened by two earlier investigations: one by the Punjab Police Special Branch, and another by the National Commission for Human Rights. Both found credible evidence of a network allegedly exploiting blasphemy laws for financial gain.
 
 

By throwing a spanner in the works, the courts risk sending the message that even in matters where innocent lives are at stake, entrenched interests may be shielded from scrutiny. This is a disservice to justice. The judicial process must not lose sight of the suffering endured by victims of false accusation.
If we cannot allow even a fact-finding inquiry to proceed, how can we ever claim to stand for the rule of law?

Political tensions bet­ween the two nations over the years have cast a sha­d­ow over bilateral sporting events, causing major tournaments to hang in the balance. The countries’ teams have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, electing to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead.
A circular issued today by the PSB said the decision was taken during the 34th board meeting held on Wednesday. The circular explicitly urged all national federations to strictly adhere to the directive.
“In view of the current security situation, no national federation shall make any commitment or agreement regarding participation in sports events in India without prior permission from PSB,” it said.
The PSB cited prevailing security concerns as a reason for the new directive.
There has been a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of a terror attack in Pahalgam earlier this year that left 26 tourists dead.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack, an accusation Islamabad denies. The incident triggered a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the two countries against each other and a military conflict until a ceasefire was announced in May.
 
 

India will host the women’s 50-overs World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.
Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players — part of the World Championship of Legends — was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing the tensions between the two nations.</p><small>2025-07-26 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2615514986a61d6.png?r=155248' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926714/info-minister-apologises-to-boxer-shahzaib-rindh-for-unjustified-delay-in-monetary-reward-support' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister apologises to boxer Shahzaib Rindh for ‘unjustified’ delay in monetary reward, support</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday apologised to mixed martial arts player Shahzaib Rindh for the “inordinate delay” in the government’s promised financial reward and support.
In September, Rindh made history when he won the Karate Combat Championship (KC-49) in Singapore, becoming the first-ever world champion from Pakistan after defeating Brazil’s Bruno Roberto De Assis in the final.
Following the win, President Asif Ali Zardari had presented Rindh with a cheque worth Rs100 million, the Balochistan government announced Rs2m as a cash prize, while a former minister had also promised him 25 acres of land.
Tarar’s apology today comes after Rindh, in a post on X on Wednesday, had slammed the government for its “fake promises” of Rs5m in cash and an additional Rs80m to support his training and upcoming matches.
“Our politicians are corrupt,” Rindh alleged, adding that the last time he won, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced rewards for him.
“It was all [a] lie; I never got [a] penny from them. They just take pictures, fake promises and forget shame,” he added.
 


Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a statement congratulating Rindh and met with him. However, a report on any announcement of a reward could not be found.
Tarar responded to Rindh’s criticism today, apologising for the delay in the promised support.
“There seems to be some miscommunication. We sincerely apologise for this unjustified delay,” the minister posted on X.
“Sportsmen like you are our real heroes and we value your achievements. You have brought great honour to the country and made us all proud.”
He added: “The prime minister has taken a serious notice of this inordinate delay and rest assured, it will be sorted out immediately inshallah.
“The PM has further instructed that such mistakes must never happen in the future. We regret this unjustified delay and the inconvenience caused,” the minister said.
 






In response, Rindh welcomed the “acknowledgement”, saying: “I truly appreciate the prime minister’s attention to this matter and his commitment to supporting athletes like myself.
“Representing Pakistan on the world stage is an honour, and I will always give my all for our country. Inshallah, with your support, we can continue to uplift and inspire the next generation of champions,” he added, saying he looked forward to the issue’s resolution soon.
 






In April last year, Rindh had decried the government’s lack of support, saying it was its “bad luck” that it did not support the country’s heroes after his 2-1 victory over India at Dubai’s Karate Combat 45 event.</p><small>2025-07-26 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261342152f7b1b5.jpg?r=134334' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926710/6-killed-in-courthouse-attack-in-irans-sistan-baluchestan-province-report' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed in courthouse attack in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province: report</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were killed and 22 were injured in an armed attack by the Jaish al-Adl group on a courthouse in Iran’s restive Sistan-Baluchestan province on Saturday, state media reported.
Three attackers were killed, according to the report by IRNA.
Jaish al-Adl confirmed the deaths of its three members in the clashes with security forces in Zahedan, the capital of the far southeastern province bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A toddler and a 60-year-old woman were among those killed, as well as three soldiers and law enforcement personnel assigned to the courthouse, the head of the province’s judiciary told IRNA. He did not identify the sixth dead person.
He said the attackers wore explosive vests and carried grenades. It was not clear if they had detonated them.
Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its Telegram account, said it had killed at least 30 members of the judiciary and security forces.
It said it targeted judges and court personnel, whom it accused of issuing death sentences and house demolition orders to Baluch citizens.
“We warn all judges and employees of the judiciary that Baluchestan will no longer be a safe place for them and death will follow them like terrifying shadows until retribution,” the group said in its statement.
It blamed security forces for the deaths of civilians, saying they had fired indiscriminately.
Sistan-Baluchestan is home to Iran’s Sunni Muslim Baloch minority, who have long complained of economic marginalisation and political exclusion.
The Baloch human rights group HAALVSH, quoting eyewitnesses, said several judiciary staff members and security personnel were killed or wounded when the assailants stormed the judges’ chambers.
Sistan-Baluchestan is frequently hit by clashes between security forces and armed groups, including militants and separatists who say they are fighting for greater rights and autonomy. Tehran accuses some of them of ties to foreign powers and involvement in cross-border smuggling and insurgency.</p><small>2025-07-26 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2612362663b3edb.png?r=123733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926704/pakistan-urges-ceasefire-de-escalation-in-russia-ukraine-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges ceasefire, de-escalation in Russia-Ukraine war</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war and stressed that “echoes for peace must be heard” as Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed a United Nations briefing.
“Peace in Ukraine is long overdue,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, told the UN Council, which debated the situation in Ukraine on Friday after Russia invaded its neighbour in March 2022.
“The calls for ending this conflict should not be allowed to go unheard or masked by the continued drums of war,” he added, highlighting that the conflict was now four years old.
Pakistan, as a consistent advocate for peace, has called for de-escalation and giving primacy to dialogue over fighting, said Ambassador Jadoon, who at that time was chairing the 15-member meeting.
“Only a sincere and meaningful dialogue which addresses mutual security concerns of all sides, is anchored in the principles of UN Charter and international law, and respects the relevant multilateral agreements can help lead to a peace, which is durable, just and long-lasting,” the Pakistani envoy added.
“Military solution and continued escalation are akin to pursuing a dead end,” he said, adding that continued attacks have only deepened the suffering of people affected by this conflict. “Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire, and unwavering commitment to dialogue. “
Despite the diplomatic efforts at the start of this year, including Security Council Resolution 2774 and multiple limited ceasefire understandings, Ambassador Jadoon noted that tangible progress has remained elusive.
“While prisoner exchanges and talks in Istanbul offer a glimmer of hope, it is unfortunate that the ongoing violence, death, and destruction from relentless attacks have continued to cast a shadow over the nascent and fledgling peace efforts.”
In this regard, Ambassador Jadoon underscored the need for the protection of civilians, stating that the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure under any pretext is unjustifiable.
“Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire and unwavering commitment to dialogue,” he added.
Asserting that diplomacy was the only path forward, the Pakistani envoy welcomed the talks between Russia and Ukraine.
“These [talks] must translate into tangible de-escalation, and steps such as prisoner swaps should catalyse broader political negotiations, aimed at ending this conflict.”
Pakistan, he added, stands ready to support all regional and international efforts that pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.
At the outset, a senior UN official told the Security Council that the daily barrage of Russian missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and towns has continued to intensify, with devastating consequences for the civilian population.
Miroslav Jenca, assistant secretary-general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that civilian casualties in Ukraine reached a three-year high in June, citing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has launched at least 5,183 long-range munitions against Ukraine in July, including a record number of 728 long-range drones on July 9.
Recalling that delegations from both countries recently met in Istanbul for the third time in 2025, the UN official urged that ongoing diplomatic contacts be sustained.
However, he urged that they be “reinforced by genuine political will to make tangible progress towards ending the current dangerous cycle of escalation as soon as possible”.
On her part, Joyce Msuya, assistant secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, said, “There is no safe place left in Ukraine,” emphasising that “the use of explosive weapons in populated areas — including long-range missiles and drones — remains a key driver of civilian harm”.
Civilians in Ukraine continue to bear the heaviest burden, struggling to access food, water, power, and healthcare. “Nearly 13 million people need assistance, but limited funding means we can reach only a fraction of them,” she reported, adding: “For many displaced women and girls, safety remains out of reach.”
She also said that the continued use of anti-personnel mines puts civilian lives and livelihoods at daily risk. She noted with alarm “the recent decree by the Ukrainian president announcing his country’s withdrawal” from the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, which prohibits the use of these munitions.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26131101d4d3d97.jpg?r=145033' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926705/karakoram-highway-reopened-as-rescue-aid-efforts-continue-in-flood-hit-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Karakoram Highway reopened as rescue, aid efforts continue in flood-hit GB</strong></a><br><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On Monday, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded. At least nine people died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.”
He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.
Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.
 


“Floods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,” the official said.
He added that the local government has distributed “hundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people” across the region.
Speaking about the search operation in Babusar, Faraq said, “There may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.”
“The Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,” he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.
Another rescue operation was underway in Fairy Meadows, according to the government spokesperson.

“Four stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.
Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority issued a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country. It advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
GB govt announces free flights for stranded tourists, locals
The GB government has started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.
In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. “A special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,” he added.
He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to “facilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations”.
A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.
The chief secretary further noted, “The main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.”
He said that the cloudburst-induced destructive flood at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving hundreds of tourists and locals stranded.
 
 

“However, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,” he added.
Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.
“The GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,” he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26154846fb61839.png?r=161346' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926719/china-urges-global-consensus-on-balancing-ai-development-security' target='_blank'><strong>China urges global consensus on balancing AI development, security</strong></a><br><p>China’s premier Li Qiang warned on Saturday that artificial intelligence development must be weighed against the security risks, saying a global consensus was urgently needed even as the tech race between Beijing and Washington shows no sign of abating.
His remarks came just days after United States President Donald Trump unveiled an aggressive low-regulation strategy aimed at cementing US dominance in the fast-moving field, promising to “remove red tape and onerous regulation” that could hinder private sector AI development.
Opening the World AI Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai on Saturday, Li emphasised the need for governance and open-source development, announcing the establishment of a Chinese-led body for international AI cooperation.
“The risks and challenges brought by artificial intelligence have drawn widespread attention […] How to find a balance between development and security urgently requires further consensus from the entire society,” the premier said.
Li said China would “actively promote” the development of open-source AI, adding Beijing was willing to share advances with other countries, particularly developing ones.
“If we engage in technological monopolies, controls and blockage, artificial intelligence will become the preserve of a few countries and a few enterprises,” he said.
“Only by adhering to openness, sharing and fairness in access to intelligence can more countries and groups benefit from (AI).”
The premier highlighted “insufficient supply of computing power and chips” as a bottleneck.
Washington has expanded its efforts in recent years to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, concerned that these can be used to advance Beijing’s military systems and erode US tech dominance.
 
 

For its part, China has made AI a pillar of its plans for technological self-reliance, with the government pledging a raft of measures to boost the sector.
In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled an AI model that performed as well as top US systems despite using less powerful chips.
‘Pet tiger cub’
At a time when AI is being integrated across virtually all industries, its uses have raised major ethical questions, from the spread of misinformation to its impact on employment, or the potential loss of technological control.
In a speech at WAIC on Saturday, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Geoffrey Hinton compared the situation to keeping “a very cute tiger cub as a pet”.
“To survive”, he said, you need to ensure you can train it not to kill you when it grows up.
In a video message played at the WAIC opening ceremony, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said AI governance would be “a defining test of international cooperation”.
The ceremony also saw the French president’s AI envoy, Anne Bouverot, underscore the “an urgent need” for global action.
At an AI summit in Paris in February, 58 countries including China, France and India — as well as the European Union and African Union Commission — called for enhanced coordination on AI governance.
But the US warned against “excessive regulation”, and alongside the United Kingdom, refused to sign the summit’s appeal for an “open”, “inclusive” and “ethical” AI.</p><small>2025-07-26 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261427053b95bc0.jpg?r=142716' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926715/new-delhi-police-arrest-man-running-fake-embassy' target='_blank'><strong>New Delhi police arrest man running ‘fake embassy’</strong></a><br><p>Police in India have arrested a man accused of running a fake embassy from a rented house near New Delhi and duping job seekers out of money with promises of overseas employment.
Harsh Vardhan Jain, 47, was operating an “illegal West Arctic embassy by renting a house” in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, which neighbours the capital, local police said.
Jain, according to police, claimed to be the ambassador of fictional nations “like West Arctica, Saborga, Poulvia, Lodonia”.
He allegedly used vehicles with fake diplomatic plates and shared doctored photos of himself with Indian leaders to bolster his claims.
“His main activities involved acting as a broker to secure work in foreign countries for companies and private individuals, as well as operating a hawala (money transfer) racket through shell companies,” the police said in a statement following his arrest earlier this week.
He is also accused of money laundering.
During a raid on Jain’s property, police said they recovered $53,500 in cash in addition to doctored passports and forged documents bearing stamps of India’s foreign ministry.
AFP was unable to reach Jain or his representatives for comment.
Westarctica, cited by the police as one of the countries Jain claimed to be representing, is a US-registered nonprofit “dedicated to studying and preserving this vast, magnificent, desolate region” of Western Antarctica.
In a statement, it said it had appointed Jain as its “Honorary Consul to India” after he had made a “generous donation”.
“He was never granted the position or authority of ambassador,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:40</small></div><hr>
