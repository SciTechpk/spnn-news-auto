Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in the Jordanian capital on Sunday.
Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine state.
In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.”

Hamas has opposed ex-UK PM’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as guardian for Palestinian state

“We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.
The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords.
Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.
Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palest­in­ian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Bri­tain, who failed in Iraq, come and — with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair — be our guardian as if we were minors?”
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled to Israel on Monday, Trump questioned whether Blair would be popular enough with other leaders to serve on the board that the US president envisages overseeing the governance of Gaza.

Trump reignited his trade war with China on Friday, accusing Beijing of imposing “extraordinarily aggressive” new export curbs relating to rare earths. He announced extra levies — plus export controls on “critical software” — due to take effect from Nov 1, and threatened to cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump claims US wants to help China, not hurt it

On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Commerce called Trump’s tariff threat a “typical example of ‘double standards’”. The ministry said Washington had ratcheted up economic measures against Beijing since September.
“Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,” it said in an online statement.
 
 

Chinese goods currently face US tariffs of 30pc under levies that Trump brought in while accusing Beijing of aiding in the fentanyl trade, and over alleged unfair practices.
China’s retaliatory tariffs are currently at 10pc.
China dominates global production and processing of these materials, and on Thursday announced new controls on the export of technologies used for the mining and processing of critical minerals.
 
 

Rare earths have been a major sticking point in recent trade negotiations between the two superpowers. They are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology.
Later, in his post on Truth Social, President Trump said, “The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”, adding that President Xi Jinping “… doesn’t want Depression for his country”.

It is the first time scientists have declared that Earth has likely reached a so-called  “tipping point” — a shift that could trigger massive and often permanent changes in the natural world.
“Sadly, we’re now almost certain that we crossed one of those tipping points for warm water or tropical coral reefs,” report lead Tim Lenton, a climate and Earth system scientist at the University of Exeter, said.
This conclusion was supported by real-world observations of  “unprecedented” coral death across tropical reefs since the first comprehensive assessment of tipping points science was published in 2023, the authors said.
In the intervening years, ocean temperatures have soared to historic highs, and the biggest and most intense coral bleaching episode ever witnessed has spread to more than 80 per cent of the world’s reefs.
Understanding of tipping points has improved since the last report, its authors said, allowing for greater confidence in estimating when one might spark a domino effect of catastrophic and often irreversible disasters.
Scientists now believe that even at lower levels of global warming than previously thought, the Amazon rainforest could tip into an unrecognisable state, and ice sheets from Greenland to West Antarctica could collapse.
‘Unprecedented dieback’
For coral reefs, profound and lasting changes are already in motion.
“Already at 1.4°C of global warming, warm water coral reefs are crossing their thermal tipping point and experiencing unprecedented dieback,” said the report by 160 scientists from dozens of global research institutions.
The global scientific consensus is that most coral reefs would perish at warming of 1.5°C above preindustrial levels—a threshold just years away.
When stressed in hotter ocean waters, corals expel the microscopic algae that provide their distinct colour and food source.
Unless ocean temperatures retu­­rn to more tolerable levels, bleached corals simply cannot recover and eventually die of starvation.
Since 2023, marine scientists have reported coral mortality on a scale never seen before, with reefs turning ghostly white across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans.
“I am afraid their response confirms that we can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” Lenton said.
Rather than disappear completely, scientists say reefs will evolve into less diverse ecosystems as they are overtaken by algae, sponges, and other simpler organisms better able to withstand hotter oceans.
These species would come to dominate this new underwater world, and over time, the dead coral skeletons beneath would erode into rubble.
Such a shift would be disastrous for the hundreds of millions of people whose livelihoods are tied to coral reefs, and the estimated one million species that depend on them.
‘Danger zone’
Some heat-resistant strains of coral may endure longer than others, the authors said, but ultimately the only response is to stop adding more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Exceeding 1.5°C “puts the world in a greater danger zone of escalating risk of further damaging tipping points”, Lenton said, including the collapse of vital ocean currents that could have  “catastrophic” knock-on impacts.
Scientists also warned that tipping points in the Amazon were closer than previously thought, and  “widespread dieback” and large-scale forest degradation were a risk even below 2°C of global warming.
That finding will be keenly felt by Brazil, which on Monday is hosting climate ministers in Brasilia ahead of next month’s UN COP30 conference in Belem on the edge of the Amazon.
In good news — the exponential uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were two examples of  “positive” tipping points where momentum can accelerate for the better, said Lenton.
“It gives us agency back, policymakers included, to make some tangible difference, where sometimes the output from our actions is sometimes disproportionately good,” he said.

• UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’
• India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy
A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment.
The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported.
Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”.
“With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific.
“It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added.
The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid,” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement.
The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world.
 
 

Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government.
New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country.
The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives.
On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy.
However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.”

In addition, bodies of four Israeli hostages who died in captivity in Gaza were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas.
However, at least 154 Palestinian prisoners who were freed on Monday will be forced into exile by Israel, a move that families say has turned their long-awaited freedom ‘bittersweet’, Al Jazeera reported.
In Khan Yunis, thousands of people erupted with joy as Red Cross buses brought back nearly 1,700 former prisoners.
Some climbed the sides of the slowly-moving buses as they weaved their way through the dense crowds gathered at Nasser Hospital, to hug or kiss a loved one they recognised.
“The greatest joy is seeing my whole family gathered to welcome me,” Yusef Afana, a 25-year-old released prisoner from north Gaza, told AFP. “I spent 10 months in prison – some of the hardest days I’ve ever lived.
At Nasser Hospital, men in military fatigues and black balaclavas struggled to keep order as the prisoners wearing the Israel Prison Service’s grey jumpsuits came off the buses.
 
 

Patriotic music blared on speakers, while Palestinian flags flew alongside those of Hamas or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Shadi Abu Sidu, a 32-year-old from Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood, said that he and other prisoners were mistreated in jail. “Even right before our release, they continued to mistreat and humiliate us,” he told AFP.
“But now, we hope to erase those painful memories and begin life anew.”
Some of the newly released prisoners happily let themselves be carried away on relatives’ shoulders. Among the Palestinians released under a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal, about 1,700 were detained by the Israeli army in Gaza during the war, while 250 are security detainees.
Israel agreed to free them in exchange for the release of prisoners held in Gaza, under the first phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war on Gaza.
 
 

In the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah too, a large crowd had gathered to greet another group of roughly 100 prisoners released under the deal. According to NPR, celebrations in the West Bank occurred despite Israeli warnings against doing so. A flier circulated saying anyone supporting what it called “terrorist organisations” risked arrest. Crowds that gathered on hills overlooking Ofer Prison were met with tear gas and rubber bullets. As Israeli armoured vehicles drove up and fired at the crowd, and drones buzzed overhead, the multitudes were forced to scatter.
“No reception is allowed, no celebration is allowed, no gatherings,” said Alaa Bani Odeh, who came from the northern town of Tammun to find his 20-year-old son.
Israeli prisoners, bodies returned
Freed Israeli prisoners, wrapped in their country’s flag, were also welcomed by friends and family members after the end of their two-year captivity.
On Monday, Hamas released all 20 living prisoners held in Gaza, as well as the bodies of four deceased captives.  However, recovering the remains of another 22 Israeli hostages believed to have died remain a challenge. Video footage captured emotional scenes of families receiving phone messages from their loved ones.
Deported
But there was still anguish among the families of around 250 Palestinians, who were set to be deported to third countries. There are no details yet about where the freed Palestinians will be sent, but in a previous prisoner release, detainees were deported to Tunisia, Algeria and Turkiye, Al Jazeera reported.

• Police say inspector martyred; around 50 cops badly injured in violent clashes
• Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’
• Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th
LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.
There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims.
Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured.
Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”.
Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody.
Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes.
Ripples across the country
By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”.
In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers.
In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations.
 
 

Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges.
In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police.
West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables.
“The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.”
Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said.
Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17.
Stalled negotiations
Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down.
“The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.”
According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made.
When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz.
‘State brutality’
Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists.
Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force.
However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”.
“Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

• FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests
• Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended
ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend.
 
 

Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border.
Speaking on Geo News, Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.
At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night.
Mediation offers
For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’.
“I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel.
“I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said.
China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated.
‘Mind your own business’
On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul.
“War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital.
But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters.
Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.”
While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters.
Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal.
However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday.
Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.—Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed

• Phenomenon likely to disrupt Kharif crop harvesting, raise Glof risk
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
According to the latest situation report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, this could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching coping  mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
 
 

In its forecast for October, the report published by UN-OCHA says that the continued marginally negative phases of both the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole will drive rainfall across Pakistan.
Northern Punjab, KP, AJK, and GB are likely to witness below-normal rainfall, while southern areas like Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab may receive near-normal precipitation, it noted.
According to the report, the expected impacts of this phenomenon include possible disruptions to Kharif crop harvesting due to isolated storms, increased risk of dengue outbreaks in stagnant water conditions, higher chances of glacial lake outburst floods in upper areas, reduced river inflows affecting irrigation, elevated smog and air pollution in plains, and adverse effects on livestock health and fodder availability due to above-normal temperatures.
The report also takes stock of the deteriorating post-flood situation, especially in the context of “a diminishing response capacity both by government and humanitarian partners”.
“Despite robust response by local and international actors at the onset of the crisis, three months since, the presence of humanitarian partners and response capacity on the ground decreased.  Pre-positioned stocks and initial emergency funds were used, with humanitarian partners now seeking additional funding for sustained interventions to ensure provision of basic services during the transition period from a humanitarian response to that of early recovery,” the OCHA report says.
Of particular concern is the long-term damage to livelihoods, which threatens recovery and self-sustainability. Crop fields were flooded, devastating harvests, livestock and fodder were swept away, and farm machinery and agricultural tools were damaged or destroyed, wreaking havoc on livelihoods and chances of restarting income generating activities in the near future.
 
 

According to a recent geo-spatial impact assessment conducted by FAO in flood affected areas, flood waters inundated around 1.2 million hectares in Punjab, the country’s food basket, damaging major rice, cotton, and sugarcane fields. The disaster coincided with the critical window for Rabi crop planting, further threatening food security and livelihoods and the ability to bounce back.
Remaining stagnant water in some flood-affected areas is also of concern as it causes significant health risks, including outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, as well as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, which thrive in these conditions.
 
 

With over 229,760 damaged or destroyed homes, many families continue to sleep outside, with little protection from the elements or vector-borne diseases carried by mosquitoes.
Schools and health facilities have lost essential supplies and damaged or covered in thick mud preventing the resumption of classes or provision of health services. Food and fodder stocks were either washed away or now lay waterlogged and rotten, increasing food insecurity and reliance on humanitarian food rations.

The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers.
Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”.
“We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read.
“We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.”
 






In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote.
It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”.
“Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.

The unnamed depression came toward the end of the rainy season, battering land and bursting rivers that had already been soaked by months of rains, while forecasters were focused on tropical storms and two hurricanes on the Pacific coast.
“This intense rain was not expected to be of such magnitude,” President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters.
Admiral Raymundo Morales, Mexico’s Navy secretary, said the flooding was the result of the coming together of warm and cold air fronts over rivers that were already filled to the brink and mountains weakened by months of rain.
Around 100,000 homes were affected, Sheinbaum said. She is set to meet with the finance ministry later in the day to discuss rebuilding efforts, and visit some hard-hit states.
Laura Velazquez, national coordinator of civil protection, said Hidalgo and Veracruz were the states worst affected, with 29 deaths and 18 missing reported in Veracruz, and 21 deaths and 43 missing in Hidalgo.
The rain also destroyed infrastructure such as bridges and left streets filled with mud. Videos and images from last week showed emergency responders wading through deep waters to find stranded residents and get supplies to affected communities.
Authorities have deployed thousands of personnel to help evacuate, clean up and monitor the places that were hardest hit.
Electricity, which had been knocked out in towns across five states, has largely been restored. Authorities said they will also focus on containing the spread of viruses such as dengue, carried by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13223430863f006.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948608/trump-thanks-pm-shehbaz-and-my-favourite-field-marshal-asim-munir-for-gaza-peace-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Trump thanks PM Shehbaz and ‘my favourite’ Field Marshal Asim Munir for Gaza peace efforts</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders.
Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony.
Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.”
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“
PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”.

“You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added.
The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership.
 


“Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.”
“Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.”
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
PM meets other leaders
PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt.
Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan.
Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
 






The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East.
 






The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people.
 






During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people.
“Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.”
The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts.
He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them.

Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”.
“Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X.
“It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”.
He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”.
Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations.
The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices.
The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media.
Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit.
“No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday.
Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/132300192007120.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948698/de-klerk-steers-south-africa-to-last-over-win-against-bangladesh-at-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>De Klerk steers South Africa to last over win against Bangladesh at Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>South Africa’s lower order once again came to the rescue after a top order collapse, edging out Bangladesh by three wickets in a nail-biting finish in the Women’s World Cup in Visakhapatnam on Monday.
Chasing 233, the Proteas were on the ropes at 78-5, but their tail refused to throw in the towel, showing the same grit that saw them turn the tables on India in their previous outing.
A gutsy 85-run stand for the sixth wicket between Marizanne Kapp, who made 56, and Chloe Tryon, 62, steadied the ship and gave the chase a fresh lease of life.
Both batters brought up their half-centuries, but their dismissals reopened the door for Bangladesh, who sniffed an upset.
Then, Nadine de Klerk, South Africa’s player for a crisis, walked in and saw her side over the line.
Her unbeaten 37 off 29 deliveries guided her side home with three balls to spare.
“I am lost for words, actually. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but I’m happy we pulled this off,” said Tryon, who was named player-of-the-match.
“We just wanted to stay calm and wait for the bad balls. We knew we could chase 80 in the last 10 overs.”
When Tryon was run out by a direct hit from Ritu Moni, South Africa still needed 35 off 31 balls with three wickets in hand. De Klerk survived a few anxious moments, including a dropped chance on 26 and made Bangladesh pay dearly.
With eight needed off the last over, she slashed the first ball from Nahida Akter through the covers for four, then sealed the deal in style, pulling the third ball for a six.
The Proteas, who began the campaign in tatters after being bundled out for 69 in a 10 wicket drubbing by England, have now stitched together three wins on the trot to climb to third in the points table and suddenly, a semi-final berth looks well within reach.
For Bangladesh, it was a tale of missed chances. A sharper fielding effort could well have tilted the scales their way.
After a sluggish start which saw them reach 73-2 at the halfway stage, Bangladesh did well to post 232-6 in their 50 overs, thanks in main to a sparkling 51 not out from Shorna Akter.
Coming off just 35 deliveries, it was the fastest fifty of the tournament so far and included three fours and three sixes.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/131247364f0bc27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948540/ptis-sohail-afridi-elected-kp-chief-minister-in-session-marred-by-opposition-walkout' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Sohail Afridi elected KP chief minister in session marred by opposition walkout</strong></a><br><p>PTI MPA Sohail Afridi on Monday was elected the new chief executive of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and despite prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, who pushed ahead with the election despite the opposition walkout, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes.
 
 

Noting that three members of the assembly were out of the country, he announced that Afridi had won the election after securing 90 votes, prompting chants in favour of the PTI leader to ring out in the assembly hall.
Afridi had needed to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the election. Out of a total of 53 opposition members, 51 walked out of the assembly on the call of the opposition leader; the remaining two were not present for the session.
Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said they did not accept Afridi as the new chief minister.
“The PTI is interpreting the law as per their understanding, we are doing it according to our understanding. There are grey areas and now the court has to decide,” he told Dawn.com, adding that the opposition would knock on the doors of the courts.
He further contended that there were now “two chief ministers” in the province as Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted.
It should be mentioned that while Gandapur has submitted two separate resignations to Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, both have been returned over “disparate signatures”. Kundi has summoned Gandapur on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter.
Speaker sends summary to governor
Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”.
 






Have no greed for the seat, will vacate it if directed to do so: Afridi
Before announcing the results, KP Assembly Speaker Swati, in a message to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that “KP still holds the forces dear because soldiers are out there defending the province and continue to make sacrifices”.
Despite that, institutions can not be allowed to run parliament, he said. “The parliament is the representative jirga of the province’s people,” he added.
Afridi then proceeded to deliver an emphatic speech in which he expressed his admiration of and loyalty to party founder Imran Khan.
Speaking in the assembly, Afridi said that he was grateful to Imran for choosing someone who was a mere worker, belonged to a middle-class family and did not have familial links to politics.
“And neither Bhutto, Zardari nor Sharif are attached to my name,” he thundered. He further said that he belonged to the tribal districts and was proud of his background.
He said that a particular mindset had prevailed about tribal districts and its people over the past 78 years. “This mindset dictates that the people of tribal areas are only there to die, that tribal areas should always be far behind.”
He further said that Imran was aware of the deprivation faced by the tribal districts.
“However many times I thank [Imran], it is not enough,” he said. He further said that the tribal districts were ecstatic over the decision to field him as the new chief minister, and were thanking Imran and the party.
“As is the vision of my leader Imran, one does not become a leader by writing Sharif or Bhutto or Zardari with their name,” he said.
Afridi also extended his gratitude to Gandapur, saying that no one in the party had ever hesitated when it came to making sacrifices. “Ali bhai, the grace with which you tendered your resignation … I laud you for that.”
Calling himself a “champion of politics of protest”, he said that he had nothing to lose. “No cars, no bungalows, no riches and no greed for the seat. The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.”
He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.”
During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution.
He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”.
“In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said.
Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism?
“My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”.
He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account.
“They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.”
PTI congratulates Afridi
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election.
“I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said.
 






PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said.
 






PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi.
“Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said.
“Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi.
 






PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united.
“Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said.
 






Opposition decries ‘unconstitutional procedure’; speaker pushes ahead
Prior to the election, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah had spoken in the assembly and termed the election as “unconstitutional”.
During his speech, he held up a copy of the Constitution and said: “According to this Constitution, the procedure is that first your resignation is accepted. Then the administration denotifies the cabinet.”
He said the cabinet had not been denotified and Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted by the governor.
“In the presence of an existing chief minister, the election of a new chief minister is unconstitutional. So we will not become a part of this unconstitutional procedure,“ he asserted.
He also questioned the need for making the issue controversial. “If you already have the numbers, then why not wait a few days and have it be done constitutionally?”
He reiterated that the process was “unconstitutional” and said that the opposition was staging a walkout as “it did not want to be a part of this”.
Following the walkout, KP Assembly Speaker Swati said that Gandapur had sent his resignation to the governor twice and also announced the same in his speech in the assembly.
Swati said that while some people wished for Afridi to not become the new chief minister, the Constitution did not function according to people’s wishes.
“The chief minister of a province is a constitutional office holder in terms of Article 130. Clause eight of this article provides for tendering of a resignation by the chief minister under his hand … I rule that an election for the post of chief minister of KP is being lawfully conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the rules of the assembly,” he said.
Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah addressed the controversy and said: “Our stance is, and we think it to be absolutely correct, that the speaker should not have called the provincial assembly session until the resignation was accepted.”
He also criticised Afridi for his speech, saying it did not befit a chief minister or a provincial assembly.
Criticising Afridi’s view on military operations, he said the PTI should act as a political party if it wanted the state and institutions to engage with it democratically and politically.
Sanaullah questioned how could a provincial government function if it did not cooperate or work together with the federal government, saying Afridi’s speech was akin to “mutiny”. He added that the Centre would try to prevent the situation from deteriorating but if Afridi’s conduct “remains as per his speech, then I don’t think he can conduct himself as the head of a provincial government in accordance with the Constitution and law”.
Gandapur gives ‘advance congratulations’ to Afridi
At the outset of the session, Gandapur gave his “advance congratulations” to Afridi as the treasury benches thumped their desks.
He assured them that the PTI’s fight for justice would continue under the leadership of party founder Imran Khan. He expressed pride at the fact that he had submitted his resignation on October 8 on the directives of Imran.
He also called for allowing the democratic process to continue and to refrain from putting any obstacles in this regard. He further said that everything he had done as the provincial chief executive was a part of record and could be examined.
“A government can only succeed, a province can only succeed if it is self sustainable. Unfortunately, when our government came into power, we only had enough money for salaries for 18 months. But I am proudly saying right now that we have Rs280 million in the treasury,” he said.
He further said that his government provided more than what it allocated under the Annual Development Programme. He stated that under Imran’s vision, he had provided funds to all constituencies.
“In the end, I would like to say that we have a movement, a struggle and that struggle is not limited to Imran Khan. The sacrifice that he is making right now, he is doing it for the good of the nation. We stand with him and will continue to do so,” he said.
He also called for addressing the challenges the province was facing, saying that the law and order situation was more important than engaging in a war of words.
“We have to move forward  and focus on these challenges,” he said.
KP governor returns Gandapur’s resignation over ‘disparate’ signature
Separately, the controversy around Gandapur’s resignation took another turn on Sunday night after Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter.
In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”.
He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”.
 






“Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said.
Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
 






On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role.
The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it.
On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added.
A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others.
PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms.
Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.</p><small>2025-10-13 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13184020282434c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948655/phc-seeks-reply-from-aag-on-ptis-chief-minister-oath-plea' target='_blank'><strong>PHC seeks reply from AAG on PTI’s chief minister oath plea</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Monday sought a reply from the provincial AAG after the PTI submitted a plea seeking the nomination of the KP Assembly speaker to administer the oath to CM-elect Sohail Afridi.
PHC Chief Justice S. M. Attique Shah asked AAG Sanaullah to confirm whether the KP governor has received the summary related to the oath from the assembly secretariat and has instructed him to submit a reply by Wednesday.
“We will look at the matter tomorrow again. Get a response from the governor and let us know,” the judge added.
The development comes after PTI’s Sohail Afridi won the election held in the KP Assembly for the chief minister role. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes.
KP’s Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah Khan decried Afridi’s election as “unconstitutional”, and opposition lawmakers staged a walkout from the assembly.
 
 

Subsequently, in a pre-emptive move, the PTI approached the provincial high court to request that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati be nominated to administer Afridi’s oath.
An application filed by the PTI, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, contended that the KP Governor had “made himself unavailable for the purpose of taking oath of office from” CM-elect Afridi.
“The government of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cannot be allowed to come to a standstill,” it asserted, terming the administering of the CM-elect’s oath as a “matter of great urgency”.

“In view of the foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that the Speaker Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly or any other person considered appropriate may kindly be nominated as the person before whom Sohail Khan Afridi may make oath of the office of chief minister.”
The application was filed under Article 255 (oath of office) of the Constitution by Swati, MPA Shah Abu Turah and MPA Sher Ali Afridi.
PHC Chief Justice Shah took up the application in the late afternoon. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as the counsel for his party.
Separately, addressing the media in Peshawar, PTI’s Barrister Raja said the PHC gave them and Kundi time until tomorrow to “explain his reasons why he does not want to administer the oath to Sohail Khan Afridi or clarify if he would administer the oath”.
If the governor refuses, Raja added, then it will be the “legal and constitutional obligation” of the PHC chief justice to direct another person to hold the oath-taking so that Afridi can officially initiate performing his duties.
 






Following Afridi’s election, Naeem Haider Panjutha, a member of PTI founder Imran Khan’s legal team, posted on X that party members had reached the PHC with the application.
Article 129 of the Constitution states that before assuming office, a chief minister is to be administered the oath by a governor, who is Kundi in this case.
But, Panjutha said the Constitution also authorised the PHC chief justice to administer the oath if the governor refuses. “In any case, the oath-taking will take place today,” Panjutha asserted.
 






Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”.

According to ESPNCricinfo, the right-hander was born in Junagadh in 1929, and his siblings included renowned cricketers Hanif, Mushtaq and Raees Mohammad.
“One of the four Mohammad brothers to represent Pakistan in Test cricket, he featured in 20 matches for his country from 1952 to 1959,” the PCB wrote in a post on X, extending its condolences.
 






PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his condolences to Mohammad’s family in a statement, paying tribute to the batter’s services to Test cricket.
“Wazir Mohammad was a good batsman and an extremely refined human being,” Naqvi was quoted as saying, offering prayers for the family.
 






‘A guiding light’
In Pakistan’s early days, a group of brothers used to play cricket in the compound of a temple at Karachi’s Haji Camp. All five of them, who had migrated to the city from Junagadh in India, were right-handed batters and each highly talented, but the eldest brother wished for one of them to be a left-hander.
“One fine day, he told me, ‘We don’t have a left-hander in our family, why don’t you become one?’“ former Pakistan Test player Sadiq Mohammad narrated to Dawn.com about his brother Wazir on Monday.
“And then I did,” continues Sadiq. “I used to get five chances while others got only one. ‘Bat left-handed hamesha (always),’ he would say.”
The oldest member of Pakistan’s first-ever Test team, that was the level of respect Wazir demanded as not only a brother, but also later on in his short but celebrated cricket career. A lower-order batter himself, he went on to play 20 Tests for Pakistan between 1952-59.
His 801 runs at a meagre average of 27.62 in Tests is a classic case of statistics being untruthful, with his 40.40 in 160 First Class matches fighting his case.
One of the standout achievements of Wazir’s career, in fact, remains his four-hour-long unbeaten knock of 42 in the 1954 Oval Test, which became Pakistan’s maiden win in England.
His century partnership with the country’s first Test captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, in 1956-57 got Pakistan their first win against Australia. Wazir was also the national side’s only century-maker in the 1957-58 win against the West Indies, Pakistan’s maiden against the then great side.
“He scored that against a star-studded West Indies bowling attack featuring Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith,” Sadiq said. “He was such a strong personality and he had waited for the opportunity to save Pakistan. He was a very organised cricketer.”
Sadiq added how Wazir’s immense knowledge of the laws of the game made him a trusted associate for Kardar.
“Wazir bhai had a big impact [on Pakistan cricket] as he knew all laws of the game,” he said. “He guided Kardar on numerous occasions when the captain had any confusion about the rules.”
As per ESPNCricinfo, in the Kingston Test of 1957-58, when Garry Sobers made the record score of 365, the crowd stormed the ground. A patch of the pitch was damaged to the extent that a crater developed. The West Indian declaration arrived at the same time, meaning Pakistan had an awkward 90 minutes to bat that day.
Wazir told Kardar to tell the umpires that, as per the laws of the game, the wicket was not suitable for batting since the wear and tear was not due to natural reasons. The umpires initially showed reluctance to accept Pakistan’s viewpoint, but eventually, after consulting the rule book, they agreed.
As an elder brother, Sadiq said, Wazir was a guiding light. “He used to calm us down, he taught us how, when and when not to take panga (fight) with opponent players. And if we did, he guided us [on] how to handle it.”
Wazir also served as an advisor to the PCB after his retirement before moving to the United Kingdom. His cricketing aptitude and grip over the game’s laws may have been an effect of his disciplined lifestyle.
“He was a very disciplined person; from his childhood till he fell ill recently, he used to sleep as early as nine in the night,” Sadiq said.</p><small>2025-10-13 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/132102148babb13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948688/internet-services-to-face-degradation-amid-repairs-to-submarine-cable-ptcl' target='_blank'><strong>Internet services to face degradation amid repairs to submarine cable: PTCL</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) on Monday announced that users would experience degraded internet services tomorrow (Tuesday) as a submarine cable is being repaired.

Last month, PTCL warned that cuts to submarine internet cables in Saudi waters would likely impact internet services in the country during peak hours.

Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024.

The Amendment was passed by the parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Abid Shahid Zuberi continued his arguments on the case today.
 


The CB hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
During recent hearings, judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
So far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments. Hamid sought the formation of a 16-member bench as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024. Malik contended that the CB had the power to issue a judicial order for the formation of a “full court”.
 
 

On Saturday, a convention jointly hosted by the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Association resolved to continue its struggle against the 26th constitutional Amendment, declaring that the legal fraternity would not accept any judicial verdict that undermines the judiciary’s independence.
The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment.
The case was initially taken up in January, and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail questioned whether it was the right of any party to request a bench of its choice, to which Zuberi replied, “I do not think that any party has the right to select a bench of their choice. But here the case is that we are requesting a full court on some constitutional legal issues.”
The ex-SCBA president added that he had “always insisted that there should be a full court”.
Justice Mandokhail then asked why Zuberi wanted a full court, to which the latter said he would cite the former’s past judgements in favour of the formation of a full court.
Upon the judge asking how many judges were appointed in the apex court currently and what a full court would look like, Zuberi said there were a total of 24 judges. “I am not declaring any judge wrong. All judges are honourable,” he added.
 
 

Justice Ayesha then enquired of the petitioner what his request was, to which Zuberi said that judges who had been appointed to the apex court before the 26th Amendment should hear the case. The LHCBA’s counsel Hamid and BHCBA’s lawyer Malik had also made the same request.
Responding to a question by Justice Mandokhail on the reasoning behind his request, Zuberi argued that the 26th Amendment, under which the CB was formed, “itself had been challenged”.
Justice Mandokhail then wondered whether the CJP, who was elevated to his role after the passage of the contested amendment, would be part of the bench or not, at which Zuberi said that the chief justice himself should decide that.
Justice Mandokhail noted: “The chief justice was appointed under the 26th Amendment. If the constitutional amendment had not been passed, Yahya Afridi would not have become the chief justice, as the timing was specified.
“May Allah grant long life to the chief justice, the senior puisne judge (Justice Mansoor Ali Shah) was set to become the chief justice, but he could not.”
 
 

The 26th Amendment had discarded the seniority principle for the CJP’s appointment and set the selection criteria for the role from the top three senior SC judges.
Justice Mandokhail then wondered, “If we are the beneficiary [of the Amendment], then can we not be on the bench?” Justice Mazhar asked who would hear the case then.
Zuberi clarified that he had not termed them “beneficiaries” of the legislation. Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “So you are saying that the eight judges deciding the case would be wrong. It will be the same thing whether we eight sit or a full court sits,” the judge added.
“Do you think that the eight judges will become biased after sitting in the constitutional bench?” he asked. “Who would decide the case then if the amendment under which the Constitutional Bench has been formed is challenged?”
Zuberi highlighted that a full court meant the “collective minds of everyone”. Justice Aminuddin remarked that the judges were to act as per the Constitution.
At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A of the Constitution, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the SC, “does not address the matter of a full court, but benches”.
Justice Mandokhail remarked that a full court could also be termed a bench, but Justice Ayesha noted otherwise.
Questioning the CB’s powers to form a full court, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was nominated by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and asked whether the bench could include judges who were not selected by the JCP.
Zuberi, echoing the arguments presented by LHCBA counsel Malik, replied, “The constitutional bench can issue a judicial order. […] Full court is not a bench.”
Justice Mandokhail said, “How can we pass a judicial order [for full court] if it is not our jurisdiction? We will say it clearly that we do not have the jurisdiction.”
However, Justice Ayesha asked, “Is there a restriction on passing a judicial order?”
At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked Zuberi if he wanted the full court matter to be sent to the senior puisne judge. The ex-SCBA president responded that the matter should first be forwarded to the CJP, and “if the chief justice recuses from it, then it should be sent to the senior puisne judge”.
Justice Mazhar questioned how the matter would be sent to the CJP as he was “not the head of the roster”.
Zuberi argued: “If you do not have the power, then how were full courts formed till now?”
 
 

He contended that the chief justice could not refuse to constitute a full court after a judicial order for it.
“How can we issue a judicial order if there are objections on the chief justice and the constitutional bench?” remarked Justice Hilali. Justice Mandokhail also asked whether the CB could issue directives to the CJP to “include specific judges in the bench and exclude certain judges”.
Zuberi reiterated that the CB had the authority to issue orders for the formation of a full court.
Justice Aminuddin asked whether a CB could hear a regular case that was fixed for hearing before it, to which the lawyer replied that the case would be sent to a regular bench.
“You are saying that the constitutional bench can hear the case but should not do so,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. Zuberi emphasised that the case about the 26th Constitutional Amendment was an important one, adding that “no Amendment had ever been challenged successfully”.
“Do not pick and choose. Speak on the rules,” said Justice Mandokhail.
Explaining the difference between jurisdiction and judicial power, Zuberi said, “All the judges of the Supreme Court have the same judicial power. Jurisdiction is conferred under Article 175(2) — whether it is appellate, criminal or review.”
Referring to various Sections of the Constitution, Justice Ayesha observed that “jurisdiction is not vested with a bench” but in the court. “Is there a bar under any of these provisions which prevents the constitution of a full court?” she asked again.
“If there is no bar, then the request for a full court is in line with the convention of this court and there have been numerous occasions when a full court has been asked,” she said, recalling that a full court also took up the petitions against the SC Practice and Procedure Act 2023.

Justice Mandokhail remarked, “On the one hand, you are asking for a full court, but on the other hand, you are limiting it to 16 judges. Why not [all] the 24?”
The judge told Zuberi he could only request a full court comprising all judges. He then asked the lawyer whether it would be acceptable to him if the JCP declared all judges part of the CB, to which Zuberi replied in the affirmative.
At one point, Justice Afghan observed, “Whether you like it or not, Article 191A exists. The term ‘full court’ is not present in Article 191A.
“You are saying to send the matter of a full court to the chief justice. Under Article 191A, the chief justice does not have the authority anymore,” he added. The judge also noted that the judges Zuberi wanted to include in the full court were not a part of the CB, which now comprises a total of 13 judges.
 
 

Justice Afghan said Article 191A restricted constitutional matters to CBs only. “In the presence of Article 191A, do you not think that the constitutional bench judges complete the full court?”
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-13 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/131953585fe39f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948681/pakistan-army-wins-gold-at-exercise-cambrian-patrol-2025-in-the-uk-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army wins gold at Exercise Cambrian Patrol 2025 in the UK: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan Army team won the gold medal at Exercise Cambrian Pat­rol-2025, held in Wales from October 3-13, according to a statement from the military’s media wing.

“This year, 137 teams from 36 Countries participated in the exercise and out of all these teams, [the] Pakistan Army’s team, led by Captain Muhammad Saad, showed exceptional performance in the exercise and [was] awarded with the gold medal,” the ISPR said.

The two countries, both of which are looking to diversify trade away from the United States due to tariff announcements, agreed to collaborate on areas such as critical minerals, trade and agricultural value chains, a joint statement said.
“Reviving this partnership will not only create opportunities for enhanced economic cooperation but also help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from shifting global alliances,” it said.
Almost two years of strained relations
The statement came after Canada’s Foreign Minister Anita Anand met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and her counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday.
 






“Both of our governments agree on the importance of elevating the relationship,” Anand said in her opening remarks at the meeting with Jaishankar.
 
 

Relations between New Delhi and Ottawa were strained for almost two years after then-prime minister Justin Trudeau accused New Delhi in 2023 of involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
India denied Canada’s allegations of involvement in the murder and in turn accused Ottawa of fostering separatist groups on its soil.
In June this year, Trudeau’s successor Mark Carney hosted Modi at the G7 summit in Kananaskis in the Canadian province of Alberta.
India is Canada’s top source of temporary foreign workers and international students, as well as an important market for pulses such as lentils and yellow peas.
Canada is home to an influential Sikh community. Indian leaders say there are some fringe groups there that are still sympathetic to the cause of an independent Sikh state called Khalistan to be carved out of Hindu-majority India.</p><small>2025-10-13 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13194242c30b769.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948645/in-jerusalem-trump-hails-historic-dawn-of-a-new-middle-east-after-gaza-ceasefire-deal' target='_blank'><strong>In Jerusalem, Trump hails ‘historic dawn of a new Middle East’ after Gaza ceasefire deal</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump told the Israeli parliament on Monday that the ceasefire he helped broker in the Gaza conflict had ushered in the “historic dawn of a new Middle East”.
“And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said.
“This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“
 
 

Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails.
Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world.
“Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament.
“We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“
 


The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled.
Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported.
“That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest.
 






Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address.
“From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said.
“For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added.
“The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said.
Trump also said he wanted a peace deal with Iran, after the US joined Israel in striking the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites during a brief war earlier this year.
“They got it from one side, from the other, and you know it would be great if we could make a peace deal with them,” Trump said of Iran. “Would you be happy with that? Wouldn’t it be nice, I think. Because I think they want to. “
Trump ‘greatest friend’ Israel has had in White House: Netanyahu
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could pursue new “peace treaties” with Arab and Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond.
“Under your leadership, we can forge new peace treaties with Arab countries in the region and Muslim countries beyond the region,” Netanyahu said, adding that “no one wants peace more than the people of Israel”.
He described Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had in the White House.
“Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House. No American president has ever done more for Israel,” Netanyahu said in parliament before Trump’s address to lawmakers.
 


Israel has said it does not expect all of the dead hostages to be returned today.
Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is also due to return the bodies of the 27 captives who died or were killed in detention, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 during a previous Gaza conflict.
Among those Israel was due to release in exchange are 250 security detainees, while about 1,700 were detained by the Israeli army in Gaza during the conflict.
‘Nothing looks the same’ in flattened Gaza
In Gaza, too, the ceasefire has brought relief, but with much of the territory flattened by fighting, the road to recovery remains long.
“I returned to Sheikh Radwan with my heart trembling,” 38-year-old Fatima Salem told AFP after she returned to her neighbourhood in Gaza City.
“My eyes kept searching for landmarks I had lost — nothing looked the same, even the neighbours’ houses were gone.
“Despite the exhaustion and fear, I felt like I was coming back to my safe place. I missed the smell of my home, even if it’s now just rubble. We will pitch a tent next to it and wait for reconstruction.”
 


Trump’s visit to the Middle East aims to celebrate his role in brokering last week’s ceasefire and hostage release deal — but comes at a precarious time as Israel and Hamas negotiate what comes next.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One at the start of the “very special” visit, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.
“I think it’s going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It’s been centuries,” he said of the fighting.
“The war is over. Okay? You understand that?” the US president added.
Final details
Trump announced in late September a 20-point plan for Gaza, which helped bring about the ceasefire.
Negotiators were still wrangling late on Sunday over the final arrangements for the exchanges, with two Hamas sources telling AFP the group was insisting that Israel include seven senior Palestinian leaders on the list of those to be released.
Israel has previously rejected at least one of those names.
After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt, where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza conflict and promote Middle East peace.
While Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is due at the summit, Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli premier will not attend due to the start of a religious holiday.
In Egypt, Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan, including Hamas’s refusal to disarm and Israel’s failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory.
Trump insisted he had “guarantees” from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages.
A new governing body for devastated Gaza — which Trump himself would head under his own plan — would be established “very quickly”, he added.
Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel.
Hamas urged Trump and the mediators of the Gaza deal today to ensure Israel does not resume operations in Gaza.
“We call on all mediators and international parties to continue monitoring Israel’s conduct and to ensure it does not resume its aggression against our people in Gaza,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,869 people. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands buried under the rubble.</p><small>2025-10-13 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13151744168d9fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948624/china-very-concerned-about-border-clashes-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan-foreign-ministry-says' target='_blank'><strong>China very concerned about border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, foreign ministry says</strong></a><br><p>China is concerned about recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan and has asked the two countries to protect their nationals and investments in the region, Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Monday.
Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use its soil.
Meanwhile, China shares a border with Afghanistan and Pakistan in its western region and has sought to play a mediating role in calming hostilities between the two sides.
“China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in improving and developing Pakistan-Afghanistan relations,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular press briefing.
Beijing hopes that Kabul and Islamabad will “remain calm and restrained, and persist in properly resolving each other’s concerns through dialogue and consultation to avoid escalation of conflicts,” Lin said.
In August, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended a meeting with Pakistani and Afghan counterparts in Kabul, calling for strengthening exchanges at all levels.
In an informal trilateral meeting weeks earlier, hosted by Beijing, China said Kabul and Islamabad had agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties.</p><small>2025-10-13 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13184311ad86b92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948599/noman-derails-south-africa-to-216-6-in-first-pakistan-test' target='_blank'><strong>Noman derails South Africa to 216-6 in first Pakistan Test</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Noman Ali grabbed four wickets to restrict South Africa to 216-6 at the close of play on day two of the first Test in Lahore on Monday, despite a fighting half century from Tony de Zorzi.
Spinners dominated on a turning Gaddafi Stadium pitch as all the day’s 11 wickets went to slow bowlers, with South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy taking a career-best 6-117 to dismiss Pakistan for 378.
Zorzi was holding the fort at the close with 81 not out and Muthusamy on six as South Africa trail by 162 runs in the first innings.
Zorzi batted with guts, knocking nine boundaries and a six, combating Noman, who claimed 4-85.
 


South Africa started off well with 45-0 on the board when Noman removed touring skipper Aiden Markram for 20 and Wiaan Mulder for 17 — both caught behind by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan.
Ryan Rickelton, who scored a punishing 71 with two sixes and nine boundaries, and Zorzi added 94 for the third wicket, taking on the spinners with some aggressive shots.
It was part-timer Salman Agha who broke the stand by forcing an edge from Rickelton with Babar Azam taking a smart low catch in the slips.
Noman returned for his third spell to get Tristan Stubbs caught behind for eight and Kyle Verreynne leg-before for two while Sajid Khan removed Dewald Brevis for a golden duck.
“We need to get them out as early as possible, and a 120-run lead would help us win this Test,” said Noman.
“This pitch will further help spinners in the coming days, so it’s good for us.”
Earlier, it was Noman’s like-for-like left-armer Muthusamy who destroyed Pakistan after they resumed on 313-5, losing their last five wickets for just 16 runs.
Muthusamy, who bettered his previous Test best of 4-45 against Bangladesh in Chattogram last year, said: “It was really nice to add value to the team by getting wickets.
 
 

“It was not ideal to have lost a wicket close to stumps, but we will fight back tomorrow.”
Agha hit five fours and three sixes in his 93 and was last man out, caught in the deep off spinner Prenelan Subrayen, who took 2-78.
Agha added 49 with Rizwan to take their sixth-wicket stand to 163 before Muthusamy ripped out the middle order with three wickets in the 12th over of the day.
Rizwan was the first to go, for 75, when he edged a sharply turning ball to wicketkeeper Verreynne after a knock containing two fours and two sixes.
Two balls later, Noman went without scoring, bowled when he played down the wrong line, and then Sajid Khan followed first ball, caught in the slips.
It became 378-9 when Muthusamy bowled Shaheen Shah Afridi, on seven, for his sixth wicket.</p><small>2025-10-13 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1316295241331f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948637/psx-plummets-by-4600-points-after-weekend-afghan-skirmish-tlp-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>PSX plummets by 4,600 points after weekend Afghan skirmish, TLP crackdown</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 Index plummeted by over 4,600 points on Monday due to continuing political uncertainty, the weekend conflict with Afghanistan and the ongoing crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The benchmark KSE-100 index opened at 163,098.19 points before dropping by 4,654.77 points, or 2.85 per cent, to close at 158,443.42.
Of 482 active scrips, only 74 advanced , 375 declined while 33 remained unchanged.
The PSX had experienced a sharp decline over the previous week as a combination of global and domestic uncertainties dented investor sentiment.
Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Meanwhile, a crackdown against TLP protesters early Monday, who had been camped at Muridke after authorities blocked their route to Islamabad by digging up trenches, added more pressure.
“The new week opened on a sour note amid weekend reports of retaliatory action along the Afghan border and Friday’s global equity declines; risk aversion deepened as government measures against TLP fueled rumours of broader unrest,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities.
He advised retail investors to stay focused on long-term investing with capital that matched their risk tolerance and liquidity needs, and to keep asset allocation disciplined. “While valuations are not excessive, prospective returns are likely to normalise; the outsized gains seen over the past two years are unlikely to be repeated over the next two,” Farooq said.
Last week, the KSE-100 index fell by nearly 3.5pc, weighed down by concerns over the delayed staff-level agreement (SLA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), geopolitical tensions in the region, and widespread profit-taking.
Additionally, selling pressure in insurance stocks, which saw a net sell of $25 million, further dampened market sentiment. Geopolitical risks, particularly last week’s blast in Kabul, added to the unease, heightening fears of escalating tensions with Afghanistan.
Major drag came from Engro Holdings, Systems Ltd, MCB Bank, Habib Bank and Engro Fertiliser, which collectively knocked 732 points off the index.</p><small>2025-10-13 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13175418635b063.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948667/trio-win-nobel-economics-prize-for-work-on-innovation-growth-and-creative-destruction' target='_blank'><strong>Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on innovation, growth and ‘creative destruction’</strong></a><br><p>Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt won the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday for their work on how innovation and the forces of “creative destruction” can drive economic growth and lift living standards across the globe.
Their research explains how technology gives rise to new products and production methods which replace old ones, resulting in a better standard of living, health and quality of life.
“Over the last two centuries, for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. This has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a statement.
Economic growth not guaranteed
The laureates have also shown that such progress cannot be taken for granted, the Academy said, while two of the prize winners highlighted that US President Donald Trump’s trade policies would impinge on growth.
“Economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and counteract, threats to continued growth,” the Academy said.
While most economists view economic growth as a driver of prosperity, there are some who do not see it as an unalloyed good.
The 2024 Economics prize was won by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson for work on inequality and Johnson in particular has pointed to how the benefits of technological innovation can be skewed toward powerful elites.
There is also a fierce debate about what level of growth is sustainable in light of man-made climate change and environmental degradation.
The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m).
Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University in the United States, was awarded half the prize.
Aghion, a professor at the College de France and INSEAD in Paris and at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Howitt, a professor at Brown University in the United States, shared the other half.

Aghion says tariffs are obstacles to growth
The award comes at a potential inflexion point for the global economy with many expecting artificial intelligence to spark a new growth spurt.
It also highlights the strategic risks for Europe of falling further behind the United States and China on technologies of the future as well as the potential costs of barriers to global trade.
Speaking by phone at the press conference, Aghion said de-globalisation and tariff barriers were “obstacles to growth” adding that the bigger the market the more possibilities to exchange ideas, transfer technologies and for healthy competition.
“Anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstacle to growth. So I see there kind of dark clouds currently accumulating, pushing for barriers to trade and openness,” he said.
Aghion called on Europe to learn from the US and China, which he said have found ways to reconcile competition and industrial policy.
“In Europe, in the name of competition policy, we became very anti any form of industrial policy. I think we need to evolve on that and find ways to reconcile industrial policy in areas like defense, climate, AI, biotech,” he said.

Howitt questions returning manufacturing jobs to US
Howitt, who said he had been “absolutely stunned” by the award, was also critical of President Trump’s trade policies.
“It’s pretty clear that these are going to discourage innovation by reducing what we call the scale effect, he told Reuters. “Starting a tariff war just reduces the size of the market for everybody.”
He said that trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US could perhaps make some political sense but was not good economic policy.
“We’re good at designing running shoes, but it’s best for us to leave others to make them,” he said.

Previous winners include Krugman and Friedman
The awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, peace and literature were announced last week.
Those prizes were established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been handed out since 1901, with a few interruptions mostly due to the world wars.
The Economics prize was established much later, being given out first in 1969 when it was won by Norway’s Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands for work in dynamic economic modelling.
Tinbergen’s brother Nikolaas also won a prize, taking home Medicine in 1973.
While few economists are household names, relatively well-known winners include former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, and Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman.</p><small>2025-10-13 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13075431bd56de6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948516/prisoners-convicted-under-ata-not-entitled-to-pardon-says-balochistan-high-court' target='_blank'><strong>Prisoners convicted under ATA not entitled to pardon, says Balochistan High Court</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has ruled that prisoners convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997 are not legally entitled to any form of general or special remission or pardon.
The court declared that Section 21-F of the ATA explicitly excludes terrorists from eligibility for clemency or sentence reduction, leaving no room for interpretation or relaxation.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Najamuddin Mengal announced the verdict while hearing several constitutional petitions filed in 2023 and 2024, dismissing all of them collectively.
 
 

According to the judgement, the petitioners had argued that they were entitled to the president’s pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution and to general or special remission under the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
However, the court held that the insertion of Section 21-F in 2001 was specifically intended to permanently exclude terrorism convicts from the scope of pardons. The bench noted that the amendment was a deliberate legislative act aimed at protecting public safety amid rising incidents of terrorism.
 
 

The court emphasised that the Anti-Terrorism Act is a special law that takes precedence over general laws, including the Prisons Act of 1894. It further rejected the argument that denying remission to terrorism convicts violates Article 25 (Equality Before Law) of the Constitution, stating that terrorism convicts constitute a distinct legal class, and such classification is reasonable and constitutionally valid.
Citing precedents from the Supreme Court cases of Sherwani, Government of Balochistan vs. Azizullah, and Dr Mubashir Hassan vs. Federation of Pakistan, the bench affirmed that reasonable classification is permissible under the Constitution.
The court directed the Home Depar­t­ment, Inspector General of Prisons, and relevant superintendents to immediately revoke all illegal remissions granted contrary to the law and recalculate the sentences of affected inmates.
It also instructed that future pardons or remissions must strictly comply with legal provisions, warning that officers violating the law would face disciplinary action.

Sources said the chimp had been under treatment for months.
Speaking to Dawn, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official Daniyal Sial confirmed her death, saying that “senility” had been declared the cause of death in her post-mortem report.
“Bibi has been under treatment for a long time for multiple health complications, mainly resulting from old age,” he said, adding that she was around 40 years old.
 
 

According to the KMC sources, Bibi was handed over to the zoo after being caught by the police in an operation
Bibi was captured after she and her mate had escaped from a PECHS house in 2000; the male chimp was killed in police operation in the year 2000. She, along with her mate, had escaped from a house in the PECHS area where they had been kept illegally as “pets”.
“The male chimp had to be killed when it had grabbed a police official while Bibi was captured and brought to the zoo where she was later paired with another male chimpanzee. He died three years’ later due to malignant growth on his ear,” explained an official, adding that the zoo is now left with only one surviving female chimp.
Chimpanzees are listed as endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They have already disappeared completely from four countries and are under tremendous pressure everywhere else they live, mainly due to illegal wildlife trade and habitat destruction.
 
 

Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulations and laws, chimpanzees are classified as an Appendix I species, completely banning the trade in chimps and parts, except in rare cases such as scientific research.
“In compliance to the international law, we have the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Flora and Fauna Act 2012, strictly monitoring all movements concerning wildlife,” said Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar.
He pointed out that the Rule 86/Sub-rule 7 of the Sindh Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Rules 2022 didn’t allow import of primates.
“The primates kept in the zoo were among the species once brought to the country under shady deals, prior to the enactment of these laws. Now, there is strict surveillance at the international, national and provincial levels over trans-boundary movement of wildlife species,” he said, adding that these laws banned trade of all wildly caught species.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has also asked Boeing, the maker of these aircraft, to submit a report providing details, including preventive measures at the time of a RAT deployment incident, the regulator said.
This comes after the crew of an Air India 787 Dreamliner — which was flying from the northern Indian city of Amritsar to Birmingham, UK — detected deployment of the power system during the final approach, Air India had said in a statement on Sunday.
Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
In July, Indian investigators had said the RAT had also been deployed during the initial climb before the Air India Boeing 787 crash, which killed 260 people in June.</p><small>2025-10-13 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/130828501e5c5d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948566/im-good-at-making-peace-trump-turns-attention-to-border-skirmishes-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘I’m good at making peace’: Trump turns attention to border skirmishes between Pakistan and Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Monday appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan after border skirmishes between the two countries over the weekend, saying he was “good at making peace”.
Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
The US president, since returning to the White House for his second term in January, had repeatedly insisted in the run up to the Nobel peace prize that he deserved the award for his role in resolving eight conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
The US president touched on the border hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan while speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. Tel Aviv and Hamas are set to carry out a hostage-prisoner exchange as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan proposed by Trump.
 


During the interaction with the media, a reporter stated that the US president was receiving credit from Democrats and Republicans for securing the peace deal in Gaza.
“Where do you think it fits into your legacy?” the reporter asked.
“This will be my eighth war that I’ve solved. And I hear now there’s a war going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back’. I am doing another one’. Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace and it is an honour to do it. I save millions of lives,” he said.
Commenting on the Nobel peace prize being awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, he said: “In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024 … But there are those that say you could make an exception cause a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and completed and great.
“But I did this not for Nobel, I did this for saving lives,” he said.
“Think about India-Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31 [years], one going for 32 [years] and one going for 37 years. And I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good,” he said.
He went on to say that he had settled “a few of the wars just based on tariffs”.
“With India and Pakistan, I said if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I’m going to put big tariffs on you both; like a 100 per cent, a 150pc and 200pc … I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs you could have never settled that war,” he said.
Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
