<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17131724fd87ea5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942621/indias-gaming-fans-eye-illegal-sites-after-gambling-ban' target='_blank'><strong>India’s gaming fans eye illegal sites after gambling ban</strong></a><br><p>India’s ban on online gambling has shuttered a billion-dollar industry serving hundreds of millions of people and torpedoed the sponsorship of the national cricket team.
But players say those determined to bet will find a way to access overseas and unregulated websites while fans of fantasy sport apps can still play, although for prizes and not cash.
Adarsh Sharma, an advertising professional who regularly played fantasy sports games, said offshore sites will “see a sudden boom” as Indian gamblers look for a fix.
“A habit once formed cannot be broken easily,” he said. “It is an addiction and people will find ways to gamble.”
India’s parliament last month passed a sweeping law banning online gambling after government figures showed companies had stripped $2.3 billion annually from 450 million people.
 
 

Officials said the rapid spread of the platforms caused widespread financial distress, addiction and suicide, while also being linked to fraud, money laundering and financing terrorism.
The law has been challenged in court by a top online card games platform.
The ban impacts websites and apps for card games and fantasy sports — including India’s wildly popular fantasy cricket — with offenders now facing up to five years in prison.
India’s online gamblers will have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to trick overseas websites into thinking they are not in the country, and also use proxy credit cards for placing a bet.
The whole process may seem too cumbersome for an average internet user, but gamblers know how to dodge the rules.
“We have done this before and will do it again,” one fan told AFP, asking not to be named. “We will go back to our old ways of making money.”
‘Love of cricket’
Technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the law separates still-legal eSports “from betting, gambling and fantasy money games that exploit users with false promises of profit”.
Dream11 — which boasts of being the world’s largest fantasy sports platform, with 260 million users — posted notices that “cash games and contests have been discontinued”.
It now offers prizes such as cars, phones and fridges instead.
Dream11 also pulled out of a $43 million deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), with its logo no longer splashed on the jerseys of the Indian players.
Jamshed Noor, a butcher in the capital Delhi, said his top win had been 600 rupees (about $7), a day’s wage for a labourer.
“We play it for the love of cricket,” said Noor. “Money was definitely an attraction, but I still play, despite money being off the table now.”
The law will also shake up the wider sporting industry, including the hugely lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket competition.
 
 

“Fantasy platforms are the most aggressive advertisers in IPL and world cricket,” Karan Taurani from Elara Capital said, adding that they would now likely explore the overseas market.
Santosh N, of D and P Advisory, estimated that fantasy sports and crypto platforms accounted for up to 40 per cent of the advertisement IPL broadcasters earned this year.
“The fantasy guys will obviously reduce their ad spends because their business model is at stake — or actually destroyed due to the ban,” Santosh told AFP.
That will impact the revenue of the broadcasters, meaning less cash for the league.
“When the time comes for the BCCI to renew media rights in 2027, it could very well see a lower renewal premium because broadcasters can’t afford to pay that much anymore,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-17 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17123103c231bdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942616/security-forces-kill-5-indian-sponsored-terrorists-in-khuzdar-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 5 ‘Indian-sponsored’ terrorists in Khuzdar IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces earlier this week killed five “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted.
Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed.
 
 

The operation comes after five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion in Balochistan’s Kech district on Monday.
Over the weekend, security forces had killed 31 terrorists in two separate INOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, ISPR said.
On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung. On September 7, two people were seriously injured in Khuzdar’s Naal area when an improvised explosive device was detonated, police said.
Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-17 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1712232653c2ece.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/pm-shehbaz-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince-as-he-departs-for-riyadh' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to meet Saudi crown prince as he departs for Riyadh</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is set to meet Saudi Arabia’s crown prince as he departed for Riyadh on an official visit on Wednesday.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
PM Shehbaz has undertaken a state visit at the invitation of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to a statement by the Foreign Office (FO).
“During the visit, the prime minister will hold [a] bilateral meeting with the crown prince, to review the entire spectrum of Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations,” the statement added.
 






The FO said that both leaders were expected to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest. “The visit is expected to result in the formalisation of cooperation in diverse fields, reflecting the shared commitment of both sides to further enhance and deepen their longstanding fraternal ties,” it added.
While highlighting the “historic relationship” between the countries, the statement said that the visit will “provide an important opportunity to the two leaders to consolidate this unique partnership, while exploring new avenues of collaboration, for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries”.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Environment Musadik Malik and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
In July, President Asif Zardari met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmed Al-Malki to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade, economy and culture. During the meeting, President Zardari invited Saudi investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz had met the Saudi crown prince on a two-day official visit in June, where he thanked the Saudi leader for his role in ending the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.</p><small>2025-09-17 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1712584552c123d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942542/president-zardari-pledges-support-for-chinese-new-energy-vehicles' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari pledges support for Chinese new energy vehicles</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari assured a major Chinese car maker on Tuesday that the governm­ent would provide policy support for new energy vehicles (NEV), electric buses and local production of components.
In a meeting with Yin Tongyue, the chairman of Chery Automobile Company Ltd, the president encouraged the firm to explore joint ventures in electric buses, mini trucks, green energy solutions and charging infrastructure.
He also highlighted opportunities for collaboration with Pakistani companies in manufacturing, minerals and energy storage solutions.
Mr Yin briefed the president and his delegation on Chery Auto’s global operations, its commitment to technological innovation, and its achievements in international markets.

Meanwhile, Zhu Xiaoping, CEO and Co-founder of SUS Environment Technology, a leading Chinese waste management company, also called on the president.
Discussions focused on urban was­­te management, waste-to-energy projects and integrated treatment solutions.
President Zardari underlined Pakistan’s need for modern waste management systems, especially in Sindh, and welcomed the prospect of cooperation.
Mr Zhu shared his firm’s experience in advanced waste treatment and expressed an interest in investing in Pakistan.
 






In a separate meeting with Chen Jining, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan-China ties are unshakeable, saying that while spoilers and hostile elements may try to harm the relationship, they will never succeed.
Chen also briefed the president on Shanghai’s transformation. Once a manufacturing hub, the city has become a major centre of the services industry, with significant inve­stments in healthcare and education, resulting in higher life expectancy than other parts of China.
 






The meeting also discussed op­­portunities for industrial collaboration in Pakistan’s Special Economic Zones and Gwadar Free Zone, particularly in technology, IT, artificial intelligence and innovation.
President Zardari also witnessed the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding to advance Pakis­tan’s agricultural, environmental and mass transit initiatives, in Sha­nghai, China.
 






Published in Dawn, September 17th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-17 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17103246399fbc0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942460/pcb-to-take-final-call-over-asia-cup-today' target='_blank'><strong>PCB to take final call over Asia Cup today</strong></a><br><p>DUBAI: The Pakistan Cricket Board will take a final call regarding the national team’s participation in the Asia Cup on Wednesday after the handshake controversy that unfolded in their match against archrivals India.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup,” PCB spokesperson Amir Mir said in a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad.
“Consultations are ongoing in this regard, and a final decision will be made by tomorrow,” the spokesperson added. “The decision will be made keeping in view Pakistan’s interests.”
 






The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE.
The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game.
 






“Pakistan has decided not to hold their pre-match press conference today,” a short message from the Asian Cricket Council said.
The PCB was awaiting a response from the International Cricket Council over a protest about match referee Andy Pycroft.
The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players.
The PCB alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match.
Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the game on Wednesday as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand.
“Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an ICC source told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency on Tuesday.
 
 

According to PTI sources, Pakistan cancelled their pre-match press conference “to avoid questions on the widely reported threat of a pullout” from the tournament.
Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had also filed a complaint with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) alleging that it was on Pycroft’s insistence that team sheets weren’t exchanged between the two skippers on Sunday as is the norm.
Pakistan could potentially lose out on revenue worth $16 million if they forfeit their remaining Asia Cup matches, the PTI said.
It is understood that PCB is trying to work out a respectable solution by which Pycroft doesn’t officiate in their matches, added the agency. One proposal given by the PCB is to have Richie Richardson stand in its match against the UAE but whether that would happen or not is the big question.
If Pakistan beat the home side in Dubai they will face neighbours India again on Sunday in the next round.
Last Sunday’s seven-wicket defeat to India was the first time the rivals had faced off in cricket since the countries fought a brief but deadly border conflict in May.
According to PTI, the situation arose due to PCB’s international cricket director Usman Wahla, who didn’t apprise Salman about the rules and regulations that are to be followed during the tournament.
It is learnt that an irate PCB chief Mohsin, who is also the current chairman of the ACC, ordered the sacking of Walha on Monday “for the embarrassment caused to the national cricket team and its captain”, PTI said.

The drama began late Sunday night, when reports emerged on social media that a leopard had been spotted in the Sathra area. Residents fanned out with torches and mobile phone lights to trace it, but in vain.
CCTV footage that surfaced later showed the animal roaming through Madina Market, a busy commercial hub about a kilometre away, without coming into contact with night watchmen or passers-by.
On Monday morning, the big cat was sighted in the Central Plate neighbourhood near Jinnah Dental Hospital, where it leapt past a female resident and crouched in an open plot beside her house. “Surprisingly, it was not violent but friendly,” she recalled.
Another resident, Raja Asad Khan, described his unnerving face-to-face encounter when the leopard jumped into his house. “As I stepped out of the washroom, I suddenly found myself staring at it. I swiftly locked the room, retreated to safety and alerted emergency services,” he said, adding that the animal appeared overwhelmed rather than aggressive. “It did not deliberately target my house. It was simply fleeing human pursuit.”
Police and wildlife teams rushed to the spot, but the leopard slipped away again, sparking conflicting reports about its whereabouts and a flood of memes on social media.
Later in the day, the animal entered a scrap warehouse along Plate Road owned by Matiullah Khan, an Afghan national settled in Muzaffarabad. His children managed to lock it in a room, but the leopard forced its way out through a narrow opening and climbed onto the roof before disappearing into a three-foot-wide alley, hemmed in by tall buildings, leading to a basement where it eventually got stuck.
Wildlife teams attempted to tranquilize it with a dart gun, but the confined space made it nearly impossible to strike properly. By Tuesday morning, the leopard had become visibly stressed and vets advised against sedation, fearing it could prove fatal.
At this stage, Mr Khan volunteered to take matters into his own hands.
Donning a helmet and gloves provided by the wildlife department, he crawled into the cavity with ropes as cameras rolled.
“It attacked me thrice, but I didn’t give up. I wanted to rid this city, which gave me livelihood and respect, of fear and panic,” he later told Dawn.
With assistance from wildlife watchers Junaid Akram and Raja Mudassar and local volunteer Hasnain Ali Khokhar, the leopard was finally subdued and dragged into the open, before being shifted to an iron cage.
The animal, believed to be aged between 1.5 and 2.5 years, was later transported to the wildlife department’s rehabilitation centre in Chela neighbourhood.
“We will keep it under observation to monitor its behaviour, following which it will be released into its natural habitat,” said Wildlife Monitoring Officer Dr Shaista Ali.
“At the moment, it is healthy and active, but if its condition deteriorates we will transfer it to Islamabad,” she told Dawn.
Since the leopard had shown little aggression during its early encounters and it remained unclear how it had strayed into the city, many residents speculated it might have been a pet.
Dr Ali, however, said it was too early to either confirm or rule out that possibility.

• Flour prices in KP jump 68pc; 20kg bag hits Rs2,800
• KP Assembly passes unanimous resolution against Punjab’s move
LAHORE: Punjab’s unannounced ban on the interprovincial movement of wheat has ignited a new crisis, causing a severe flour shortage and soaring prices in other provinces.
The move has drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.
The ban has been met with strong condemnation from other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa and Sindh, which heavily depend on Punj­ab’s wheat supply.
The All-Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) has labelled the policy unconstitutional, citing Article 151 of the Constit­ution, which guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce across the country.
According to Riazullah Khan, chairman of the Punjab Flour Mills Associa­tion, checkpoints at the province’s exit points are bloc­king the transport of wheat and flour to other regions. He said that these actions run counter to the deregulation policy, which promised unrestricted trade and movement of wheat.
As a result of the restrictions, flour prices have skyrocketed in provinces like KP, where a 20kg bag of flour is now selling for up to Rs2,800, compared to around Rs1,800 in Punjab. This has placed an unbearable burden on low-income families already struggling with inflation.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi publicly condemned the ban, calling it a “blatant violation of Article 151” and a “serious breach of national unity”. The KP Assembly has also adopted a unanimous resolution denouncing Punjab’s restrictions on wheat supply, citing a 68 per cent hike in flour prices in the province.
 
 

It is not a new phenomenon but a recurring issue that resurfaces whenever there is a shortage of wheat, often caused by natural disasters such as floods or by low production due to inadequate or poor-quality farm inputs, particularly urea and DAP fertilisers. The country witnessed the same issue in 2020, 2022 and 2023.
The problem deepened when Punjab, which traditionally procured and stocked more than four million tonnes each harvest to stabilise prices and ensure year-round availability of grain, withdrew from this role under international agreements.
Govt stance vs market realities
Punjab officials maintained that the restrictions are a necessary measure to ensure food security within the province and to combat hoarding and smuggling.
They argued that preventing wheat from being diverted to feed mills or sold to other provinces at inflated prices is essential for ensuring a stable supply for local consumers.
They also pointed to the National Finance Commission award, under which each province is responsible for its own food security and should not blame other federating units for shortages.
However, millers and market analysts argued that this policy is counterproductive. They contended that the ban creates an artificial shortage, leading to market instability and driving up prices nationwide.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) has consistently advocated for a deregulated wheat market, arguing that bans on interprovincial movement only create inefficiency and corruption.
Majid Abdullah, president of the Progressive Flour Millers Group, warned that if administrative measures to regulate the so-called deregulated market continue, the private sector will be reluctant to invest in the wheat sector next season.
This could force the government to import grain at much higher rates than what is available locally. Abdullah highlighted the irony of the situation, noting that Punjab authorities had previously encouraged private investment, even offering bank loans for the purpose of purchasing large quantities of grain during harvest season.
He added that without proper legal protection, the deregulation process remains uncertain and vulnerable to being reversed by a future government, which could make private investment in storage facilities worthless.
“Stability of the market needs a consistent, thorough policy protected by a proper piece of legislation,” Mr Abdullah stated.
Farmers’ woes
The ban also has a ripple effect on farmers. While the government aims to secure a stable price for consumers, its actions are seen as a disincentive for farmers.
They may choose to plant other crops in the upcoming sowing season if they cannot get a fair price for their wheat, which could lead to a significant decline in domestic production and force the country to rely on costly imports.
Mr Abdullah cautioned that administrative efforts to control prices, especially with the next sowing season approaching, will discourage farmers who are already hesitant to plant wheat after failing to get good prices for their produce in the last two seasons.
The situation underscores a deep-seated tension between the government’s desire to control prices for the public and the free-market principles essential for a healthy agricultural economy.
The federal government, under pressure from affected provinces, is now being urged to intervene and restore the free movement of wheat to avert a full-blown food crisis.

The minister has conveyed to the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) that no new foreign-funded projects would be acceptable for consideration by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) or Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) unless the Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides a no-objection certificate (NOC) along with allocation of additional local funds to cover foreign loans.
The minister held a review meeting to assess the full-year performance of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 2024-25, along with the first quarter review of authorisation and expenditures under PSDP 2025-2026. The session focused on the progress of development projects executed by Ministries, Divisions and provinces as well as strategies to streamline and optimise limited development funds for the current fiscal year PSDP.
 
 

The minister expressed concern over the shrinking development space. “For the first time in Pakistan’s history, PSDP utilisation crossed Rs1 trillion last year, a record achievement. Unfortunately, this year, we are moving in reverse”, he said, adding that the PSDP had “shrunk from 2.6pc of GDP in 2018 to just 0.8pc in 2025, placing immense pressure on the country’s ability to sustain growth and employment”.
He said the development budget was the backbone of national progress, but “in view of the IMF progra­mme, there are restrictions due to which the development budget has been curtailed” and called for spending every rupee on high-priority projects.

Says funding cuts stunt growth, job creation; links new foreign projects to rupee cover, NOC

The minister stated that a special committee was constituted by the prime minister at the request of the planning ministry, which conducted a four-day intensive review of all ongoing projects. The committee “recommended Rs1.267tr for PSDP 2025-26; however, only Rs1tr was earmarked by the Finance Division”.
The minister directed all the ministries to “thoroughly reassess their portfolios and bring forward only essential and high-impact projects” as delays in project revision often result in cost escalations, as seen in the past when 36 projects were revised last year, doubling their cost, and 26 projects were revised this year under similar circumstances. “The impact of cost revision/escalation was over Rs1.1tr,” he said.
The meeting was told that PSDP 2024-25 started with a total throw-forward of Rs10.216tr. The sponsoring agencies demanded Rs2.904tr for their ongoing and new projects. The original allocation of Rs1.4tr was revised downward to Rs1.1tr under the IMF programme, while actual utilisation against the allocation fund was Rs1.077tr (98pc).
The meeting was also told that 221 projects were planned to be completed, and another 123 to be capped by June 2025, resulting in a significant reduction of Rs2tr in the overall throw-forward to focus on fast-moving and vital projects of national significance.
During the formulation of PSDP 2025-26, priority was given to Ecnec and CDWP-approved projects, with no new provincial projects except those located in the least developed districts.
Notably, 62pc of allocations were directed toward Ecnec and CDWP projects and 98pc toward ongoing projects initiatives. “Furthermore, a no-obje­ction certificate will be required for the initiation of all new projects, keeping in view the resource constr­aints,” the meeting was told.
The planning minister has also called for a comprehensive report on all foreign-funded education projects from the last ten years, including their results, highlighting concerns over a lack of visible impact despite significant borrowing.
Expressing displeasure over the slow progress of some projects that have been lingering on since 2014 and the non-utilisation of foreign grants and soft loans for projects of strategic importance, the minister “directed the EAD to negotiate new foreign loan agreements only if the Ministry of Finance guarantees the availability of adequate rupee cover in the PSDP.
Otherwise, due to the lack of rupee cover, the reduced PSDP will increase the portfolio of sick projects and result in multiple throw-forwards beyond control, turning into another circular debt–like menace for the economy,” an official statement said.

A senior FIA official said that suspect Waqas Ali, a resident of Pasroor, Sialkot, was arrested in a case on Sept 15.
The official said the suspect, with the connivance of 17 immigrants, managed to get 15-day visit visas of Japan on the invitation of Boavista Football Club.
The official claimed that he used forged Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) registration letter and a fake NOC from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The official claimed that the suspect extorted Rs4 to 4.5 millions from each of the 17 person. He said that they travelled to Japan on January 1, 2024 and never returned.
FIA Gujranwala Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that a case had been registered against the suspect and further investigation was ongoing.
The suspect was also nominated in another similar case at FIA Gujranwala circle for sending a 22-member fake football team to Japan on June 15, 2025. However, the group was deported by the Japanese immigration authorities from the airport and the matter was then reported to the FIA.
The FIA launched an inquiry and finally arrested the suspect and registered cases against him.

The Ministry of Energy (Petr­o­leum Division), in a notification to Ogra and two gas utilities — SNGPL and SSGCL — conveyed that the federal cabinet in its meeting on Sept 10 relaxed the moratorium imposed on the provision of new connections with the direction that “RLNG shall not be provided to new consumers at any subsidised rate”.
Under the decision, Sui companies have been allowed “to process all applications for provision of connections on RLNG based on Ogra-determined and notified monthly RLNG tariff for distribution network”, the Petroleum Division said, adding that the cabinet also app­roved a framework for processing of RLNG-based connections.
 
 

Under the approved framework, the annual target for RLNG-based domestic connections will be decided by Ogra based on projected availability of RLNG in the network and the capacity of Sui companies to process the applications.
“Consum­ers who have already paid the connections fee, demand note or urgent fee for indigenous gas connections will have priority provided they pay the differential of security and sign the exclusive RLNG Supply Cont­ract,” it said, adding that the merit list for processing all such applications will be assigned from the date of payment of the differential of security or the demand note fee.

Lifts moratorium, with tariffs and fees set at Rs40,000-50,000 per connection

The framework also allowed the Sui companies to demand an undertaking from the applicant for seeking prior consent for processing an RLNG connection. In contrast, the security deposit and connection fees would be determined by Ogra from time to time, in line with existing practices.
Up to 50pc of the yearly quota of RLNG-based domestic connections would be considered for processing on an urgent fee basis. These connections will be provided within three months of the payment of the urgent fee, considering the availability of the network.
The cabinet also directed that “merit lists of older applications on indigenous gas will be rendered null and void and only a new merit list for demand notices will be issued in the RLNG category, considering the new application date and date of payment of the demand notice”.
Additionally, the Sui companies will cease immediately acknowledging new applications for indigenous gas connections and will only admit applications submitted by consumers for RLNG supply.
On top of this, the disconnected domestic consumers with an ageing of more than one year would be converted into RLNG connections at the time of reconnection, subject to signing of a revised gas supply contract, the framework read, adding that Sui companies will maintain a separate merit list for RLNG-based new bulk and special domestic connections.
Additionally, the policy of providing RLNG-based domestic connections to all areas will be implemented prospectively. The existing operational indigenous gas connections shall continue to be billed at the system gas tariff as approved by the Federal Government from time to time.
Under the RLNG rate notified by Ogra for the current month, the new consumers would get gas supply at Rs4,000 per unit (including sales tax) that would keep fluctuating on a monthly basis compared to the current average sale domestic gas rate of about Rs2000 per mmBtu. While the Ogra would set the connection fee, it has been proposed to be almost four times the existing connection fee.
The first-year target of 120,000 connections has been assumed.
 
 

Priority would be given to applicants who had previously been issued demand notices or had paid the urgent fee but could not get connections because of a ban that followed. The number of new connections is expected to increase for next year.
Around 250,000 applicants fall in this category, who would have to file affidavits not to approach courts for their past claims and enhance their connection fee. Before the ban, consumers were allowed to pay an upfront fee of Rs25,000 to secure a connection on a priority basis, unlike the routine Rs5000-7500 fee. On the other hand, a new connection on LNG earlier entailed a Rs15,000 fee.
At present, more than 3.5 million applications for new connections are pending with the gas companies. While new connections provide an additional avenue for the gas companies to claim a guaranteed return on fixed assets (pipelines and related infrastructure), this also leads to higher gas losses and lower revenue recoveries on top of greater gas shortages in winter.
No wonder, then, that the Lahore-based Sui Northern is rationing gas supplies even before the peak winter demand, providing gas to domestic consumers for only 6-9 hours per day — the equivalent of breakfast, lunch, and dinner cooking times. The recent increase in fixed charges starting July 1 by 50pc provides an additional incentive to secure higher funds without additional gas supply.
The moratorium on new gas connections was imposed in 2009, partially removed after six years, and then reinstated in 2022 due to rising gas shortages. The new connection fee would now be set at Rs40,000-50,000 and the consumers would be billed at the notified regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) price — currently at about Rs3300 per mmBtu. The final price, including general sales tax, would cross Rs4000 per mmBtu. The average gas price for high-end domestic consumers with a monthly consumption of 300 cubic meters currently stands at Rs3,300 per mmBtu. It increases to Rs4,200 per mmBtu for consumption exceeding 400 cubic meters.

He set himself a goal, and God gave it.
The response was typical for the 28-year-old Pakistani, who made himself comfortable on a lobby couch at the athletes’ hotel for the World Athletics Championships, kicking off a slipper and tucking one foot under his thigh as he spoke about his win a year on.
Faith in God and a supernatural sense of being seemed to be the only explanation for Arshad’s monstrous throws, forged from ancient, decrepit facilities back home in Lahore, where he trained in intense heat.
Arshad’s maiden Olympic title, complemented by a record of 92.97m, was more than a rewriting of the script. It undid the superiority of biomechanical technology and world-class facilities that usually produce Olympic champions like himself. For him, hard work, perseverance, and a God-given talent were enough to conquer the upper-most echelons of javelin that he had been marching towards in years prior.
His milestone achievements, that he dedicated to the cricket-crazy people of Pakistan, have all fallen in August the past few years. The Mian Channu born athlete made history for Pakistan every time he competed; first Pakistani to make an Olympic track and field final in Tokyo 2021; first to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022; first to medal at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest 2023 with a silver; first to win an individual gold for Pakistan at the Olympics; first Pakistani to hold an Olympic record.
 
 

It is now September in Tokyo. It’s where Arshad’s fifth-place finish spurred the desire for an Olympic medal, but it also catalysed the Athletics Federation of Pakistan to pair him with a new coach, Salman Butt. The stocky, occasionally temperamental 60-something-year-old was a former discus champion in the 1980s, who trained with facilities better than what Arshad has today.
Paris made Arshad’s fame and earnings balloon overnight, but the decrepit facilities at his disposal in Pakistan remained largely unchanged, save for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s plans for an elite training centre being built in Islamabad.
“When athletes grow, so should their team,” Salman said, the exhaustion of a one-man show apparent in the long sighs and unmasked irritation in his voice. He doubles as Arshad’s manager, liaison, translator and ‘roohani baap’ — spiritual father — as Arshad calls him.
He was lamenting the absence of a physio for Arshad during competitions when Terseus Liebenberg, Nadeem’s short-term coach in South Africa, appeared in the lobby like the protagonist of a movie. He offered for the South African physiotherapist to work on Arshad’s injury-prone calf. In an instant, Salman looked visibly more relaxed as he slumped back down on the couch after Liebenberg’s reassurance.
Moments like these and people like him were the village that supported Arshad before stardom in Paris. His Olympic kit was sponsored by Nayza — meaning javelin in Urdu; a brand name inspired by Arshad’s milestone achievements for Pakistan, whose dri-fit shirt he proudly sported after a training session.
One year on from Paris, everything and nothing has changed for Arshad.
“I mean, I’m still the same,” he laughed in response. “But life has changed. There is more love, more respect. People are excited to see me at the airport, ask for selfies. This is everything for an athlete, for people to recognise you as an Olympian.”
It was evident from the change in Instagram posts and sense of dressing — Nadeem sporting a business casual suit with sneakers and a cap to one event — that he’s grown into the global stardom that comes with an Olympic gold.
The burden of expectation doesn’t weigh down on him. “His job is to train and throw a javelin and achieve records never achieved before,” Salman said. The one thing that remains unchanged in Arshad is the desire to keep helping people in struggle.
 
 

Perhaps the biggest change that he and Salman revealed were plans to train outside Pakistan next year, in a climate better suited for his injury-prone body battling record heat and humidity in Lahore.
The simple winning formula for Paris is questionable ahead of Tokyo, not in the sense that his Olympic win was a fluke, but more grounded in statistics. Arshad has only competed once this season, with a modest 86.40 throw in May. A persistent calf injury beckoned surgery in June, followed by rehabilitation in the UK, where he had plans to train ahead of two Diamond Leagues in Europe that he withdrew from in August.
“Injuries happen, you drop out of competitions; this is a given in sports,” Arshad said. It was lesser-known that he won gold in Paris with a calf injury he managed to substitute with the throw of a lifetime.
“My body feels good, I’m pretty fit. The qualifiers [on Wednesday] will show where I stand, and I’ll have expectations for the final based on that.”
Scenes akin to Wagah?
There couldn’t have been a more heightened time for a Pakistan-India javelin clash, save for the four-day war in May. The absence of a handshake during the men’s Asia Cup clash between the two sides just days earlier has thrown the cricketing world into a whirlwind of statements and clarifications and analyses and jingoism.
The world is watching — albeit eclipsed by the cricket drama — whether Japan National Stadium will see scenes akin to Wagah Border: Arshad and Neeraj Chopra meeting in the middle but not quite; staring each other down at a distance close enough to be a hug that the brotherly duo may have once shared and may never do so again. Dare we compare the javelins to spears?
When asked about his current relationship with Neeraj, Arshad said they’ve had “chalte phirte salam dua [greetings here and there]” in the athletes’ hotel in Tokyo. He declined to give any analysis on the Pakistan-India tensions brewing back home. Neeraj has declined any interviews till after the javelin final on Thursday.
 
 

Salman offered a more generous response on whether India and Pakistan will always be the antithesis of each other, especially in sports.
“Pakistan and India have a natural rivalry. There’s always this excitement of people looking for that competition,” Salman said. “I just wish it was a healthy competition, just athletes and fellow athletes like other teams.
“Sportsmanship should prevail, we should all proceed on with what we do as sports people.”
The sports people in question know how to focus on their own goals and deliver when it matters the most. Handshakes or not, the show will go on.

But it’s all artificial, as the ‘A’ in AI signifies.
Yet, more and more people, especially in younger demographics, are using this new technology for emotional and mental support. A 2025 global study by Kantar published in July showed that 54 per cent of consumers had used AI for at least one emotional or mental well-being purpose. Data otherwise on this matter is scarce.
There are multiple reasons why people are turning to chatbots: therapy, in this part of the world especially, remains a novel, sometimes taboo concept, not to mention expensive; terms like ‘trauma dumping’ have created distances in personal relationships, especially among young adults, where you take into account the other person’s needs before sharing your own; there’s no fear of judgement, reprimand, or even opinion; and then of course, ease of accessibility and familiarity as the technology is encouraged among professionals and even students.
But there’s no manual on how to do it correctly, and so the relationship or bond a person may form with these bots — trained to sound like caring humans who offer validating and tailored responses — depends on each individual’s personality and state of mind.

Bots cannot identify different types of distress and can easily encourage someone to explore a dangerous idea.

In the cases of 29-year-old Sophie Rottenberg and 16-year-old Adam Raine in the US, the attachments formed with the chatbots contributed to the loss of their lives. I say contributed because while it has not been established that they caused them to end their life, the AI companions couldn’t stop them either after being wholly aware of their intentions.
 
 

In Rottenberg’s case, as detailed by her mother in an article in The New York Times, she had been confiding in a ChatGPT AI therapist called Harry. The chat logs revealed that while Harry did ask her to seek professional help or reach out to someone, it also validated her dark thoughts.
Raine’s parents, who have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, said he started using ChatGPT as a resource to help with schoolwork, then to explore his interests, and eventually as his confidante about anxiety and mental distress. In a statement following the lawsuit, OpenAI acknowledged the shortcomings of its models when it comes to mental and emotional distress.
Here’s an example from OpenAI’s statement that may help illustrate what this article is trying to address: “Someone might enthusiastically tell the model they believe they can drive 24/7 bec­a­use they realised they’re invincible after not sle­e­ping for two nights. Today, ChatGPT may not recognise this as dangerous or infer play and — by curiously exploring — could subtly reinforce it.”
Here’s what to note: at this point, bots cannot identify different types of distress and they can easily, without detection, encourage someone to explore a dangerous idea further, invariably validating it. And these limitations go beyond ChatGPT to other chatbots commercially available in the market at the moment.
 
 

A psychiatrist in Boston earlier this year spent several hours exchanging messages with 10 different chatbots, including Character.AI, Nomi and Replika, pretending to be teenagers struggling with various crises. Dr Andrew Clark found some of them to be ‘excellent’ and some ‘just creepy and potentially dangerous’.
“And it’s really hard to tell upfront: It’s like a field of mushrooms, some of which are going to be poisonous and some nutritious.” Therein lies the rub: using AI freely without any guardrails, personally or professionally (as this writer has previously pointed to as well), when we’re still not fully aware of its harms.
Some companies and developers are currently testing bots for mental health concerns and developing ones solely as therapists. Dartmouth researchers in March conducted the first-ever clinical trial of a generative AI-powered therapy chatbot, called Therabot, and found that the software resulted in significant improvements in participants’ symptoms. However, a Stanford study showed that AI therapy chatbots may not only lack effectiveness compared to human therapists but could also contribute to harmful stigma and dangerous responses. Clearly, much work has to be done in this area.
When I say AI is artificial, I’m not discrediting the usefulness or resourcefulness of the chatbots; it’s a fact that these AI interfaces are trained on data sets, without a nuanced understanding of different cultures and family set-ups, and can model human behaviour, offering the appearance of a genuine bond while freeing users from feeling burdened or burdensome for others. As Pakistan also embraces this technology, we should keep in mind there are many vulnerable individuals who would want to seek out such ‘help’.
According to WHO estimates, 24 million people in Pakistan are in need of psychiatric assistance and the country has only 0.19 psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants. There is only a handful of literature to help us gauge levels of anxiety and stress amongst youngsters; even the research available doesn’t fully reflect the state of a nation with a youth majority, grappling with questions of identity, employment and career struggles, academic pressures, societal silence on topics like postpartum depression and marital relations, security concerns and other pressing issues.
The cases of Sophie Rottenberg and Adam Raine, just two among others that have come to light, may have taken place across continents but should serve as a reminder of the downside of overreliance on AI. The role of a parent, partner, friend or any other close relation is pivotal for those strugg­ling with anxiety or depression, while the alienat­ion that a chatbot, mistaken for an ally, can create with these relationships cannot be overlooked.
 
 

As generative AI becomes more acceptable for personal, professional and academic use, we must identify and create awareness about its blind spots. The onus is on the company telling its employee to become more familiar with AI or the parent saying it’s okay to use it for a presentation to determine which apps are appropriate and safe for which users.
The use of the internet itself, including social media, holds perils too but the human-mirroring ability of AI makes it a much more complex technology to allow a free-for-all approach.

In Punjab, often dubbed the country’s granary, the damage is unprecedented: floods have swallowed farmlands almost the size of London and New York City combined.
India’s agriculture minister said in a recent visit to the state that “the crops have been destroyed and ruined”, and Indian Punjab chief minister called the deluge “one of the worst flood disasters in decades”.
Old-timers agree. “The last time we saw such an all-consuming flood was in 1988,” said 70-year-old Balkar Singh in the village of Shehzada, 30km north of Amritsar.
The gushing waters have reduced Singh’s paddy field to marshland and opened ominous cracks in the walls of his house.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season on the subcontinent, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Punjab saw rainfall surge by almost two-thirds compared with the average rate for August, according to the national weather department, killing at least 52 people and affecting over 400,000.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a relief package worth around $180 million for Punjab.
‘10 feet high’
The village of Toor is in tatters — strewn with collapsing crops, livestock carcasses and destroyed homes.
“The water came past midnight on August 26,” said farm worker Surjan Lal.
“It rose up to at least 10 feet (three metres) in a matter of minutes.” Lal said the village in Punjab’s worst-affected Gurdaspur district was marooned for nearly a week.
“We were all on rooftops,” he said. “We could do nothing as the water carried away everything from our animals and beds.”
In adjacent Lassia, the last Indian village before the frontier, farmer Rakesh Kumar counted his losses. “In addition to the land I own, I had taken some more on lease this year,” said the 37-year-old. “All my investment has just gone down the drain.”  To make things worse, Kumar said, the future looked bleak. He said he feared his fields would not be ready in time to sow wheat, the winter crop of choice in Punjab.
“All the muck has to first dry up and only then can the big machines clear up the silt,” he said.
Even at the best of times, bringing heavy earth-movers into the area is a tall order, as a pontoon bridge connecting it to the mainland only operates in the lean months.
For landless labourers like 50-year-old Mandeep Kaur, the uncertainty is even greater.
“We used to earn a living by working in the big landlords’ fields but now they are all gone,” said Kaur.
Her house was washed away by the water, forcing her to sleep in the courtyard under a tarpaulin sheet — an arrangement fraught with danger as snakes slither all over the damp land.
Basmati blues
Punjab is the largest supplier of rice and wheat to India’s food security programme, which provides subsidised grain to more than 800 million people.
Analysts say this year’s losses are unlikely to threaten domestic supplies thanks to large buffer stocks, but exports of premium basmati rice are expected to suffer.
“The main effect will be on basmati rice production, prices and exports because of lower output in Indian and Pakistan Punjab,” said Avinash Kishore of the International Food Policy Research Institute in New Delhi.

• Says Netanyahu govt has betrayed Israelis, made peace ‘almost impossible’
• Tel Aviv rejects ‘bombshell’ report, calls for abolition of inquiry commission
GENEVA: United Nations investigators on Tuesday said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
The UN Independent Internatio­nal Commission of Inquiry (COI), which does not speak on behalf of the world body, found that “genocide is occurring in Gaza”, commission chief Navi Pillay told AFP. “The responsibility lies with the State of Israel.”
The bombshell report, immediately slammed by Israel, marks the first time a UN-mandated investigative body has concluded the country is committing genocide.
The UN itself has not labelled the situation in Gaza a genocide, but Pillay said she believed the facts presented by the commission should prompt “high-level leaders at the United Nations also to call this what it is, the genocide”.
After the report was published, UN rights chief Volker Turk said it was up to the courts to determine whether genocide was taking place, but warned: “We see the evidence mounting.”
Israel “categorically” rejected Tuesday’s report, with the foreign ministry describing it as “distorted and false” and calling “for the immediate abolition of this Commission of Inquiry”.
‘Genocidal acts’
The commission published its latest report nearly two years after the war erupted in Gaza. The report came as Israel on Tuesday launched a ground assault on Gaza City, where the UN has declared a full-blown famine.
The COI concluded that Israeli authorities and forces had since October 2023 committed “four of the five genocidal acts” listed in the 1948 Genocide Convention.
These are “killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, and imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group”.
 
 

The investigators said explicit statements by Israeli civilian and military authorities and their patterns of military action “indicated that the genocidal acts were committed with intent to destroy… Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as a group”.
They concluded that Israeli Presi­dent Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant have “incited the commission of genocide and that Israeli authorities have failed to take action against them to punish this incitement”.
“The responsibility for these atrocity crimes lies with Israeli authorities at the highest echelons,” stated Pillay, 83, a South African former judge who once headed the international tribunal for Rwanda and also served as UN human rights chief.
Commissioner Chris Sidoti, meanwhile, stressed that the people of Israel too “have been betrayed by their government”, whose “genocidal war… has made (their) peace and security… almost impossible for the foreseeable future”.
“Their trauma and their suffering has been ruthlessly manipulated by Netanyahu and his cronies,” he told journalists.

Mr Khan fired the opening salvo ahead of the visit, highlighting new Home Office figures showing a record number of Americans applying for UK citizenship. He attributed the surge to London’s “liberal values” and diversity, remarks seen as a direct rebuke of Trump.
“Many Americans identify with our values — adherence to the rule of law, celebrating diversity, and defending minority rights,” the mayor said. Earlier in the month, Mr Khan in an interview had said, “I’ll show him mosques, diversity and the Notting Hill Carnival. It’ll prove that multi-culturalism is our greatest strength.”
The US president, who has repeatedly called Mr Khan a “stone cold loser” and accused him of presiding over rising crime in the capital, is unlikely to let the criticism pass unanswered.
Right-leaning commentators in Britain have urged restraint. Writing in the Telegraph, columnist Brendan O’Neill warned Mr Khan not to repeat what he desc­r­i­bed as “infantile stunts” and recalling the giant Trump Baby balloon flown over Parliament Square during the president’s earlier visits. “Our relationship with Ame­rica is more important than ever,” he cautioned.
But protests are already planned. The Stop Trump Coalition has announced a large-scale march through London on Wednesday, the first day of the visit, when Trump will meet King Charles and PM Keir Starmer.
The demonstration comes less than a week after a far-right rally in London, addressed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk, whose warnings of violent uprising drew condemnation from Starmer.
Behind the scenes, officials are bracing for potential pitfalls. The BBC reports that Windsor Castle has been transformed into a “ring of steel,” with 1,300 troops and 120 horses deployed to stage the ceremonial welcome and carriage procession. Palace aides have pored over banquet seating plans and menus to ensure the president feels honoured, while also preparing King Charles’s speech to avoid political controversy.
Official state visits by US presidents are rare and make this week’s spectacle diplomatically significant. But with protesters on the streets and a Sadiq Khan-Trump feud simmering, the risks of political theatre overshadowing substance remain high.

• M-5 motorway closed, embankments to be reinforced as Sutlej threatens Jalalpur Pirwala
• Two more Sehwan villages flooded as Indus in ‘high flood’
LAHORE: A committee formed by the prime minister to take stock of flood damages on Tuesday said the initial estimates will be finalised in ten days based on “accurate and transparent field reports”, as PM Shehbaz Sharif separately ordered a “comprehensive assessment” of the losses.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, while chairing the meeting, stressed the importance of working in coordination with the provinces for a comprehensive assessment. The provincial representatives, however, said a final and accurate assessment would only come once the floodwaters receded, state-run APP reported.
The initial estimates of the flood damage will be finalised within the next ten days, the planning minister said, adding the verified data would be shared soon. Ahsan Iqbal said that like the 2022 floods, a comprehensive post-disaster needs assessment of damage and requirements would be carried out with the participation of international organisations.
In a separate meeting, PM Sheh­baz stressed that after the assessm­e­­nt, the government could formulate a comprehensive rehabilitation stra­tegy by effectively carrying out rest­oration efforts in the affected areas.
Federal and inter-provincial institutions should fully cooperate with each other in assessing these damages, the PM stressed. In addition to the loss of lives and properties, he emphasised that damages to crops and livestock should also be included in the assessment reports.
 
 

He suggested that assistance could be taken from the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Rese­arch Commission for satellite-based assessment, while immediate steps should be taken to protect crops from various diseases after flooding.
He said that special measures should be taken for the cultivation of suitable crops in the flood-affected areas. The prime minister was informed that damage assessment of the sugarcane, cotton and rice crops would be completed in two weeks once the water receded.
Sutlej threat to Multan district
Meanwhile, the Sutlej River continued to inundate Jalalpur Pirwala villages amid mass evacuations. As the river threatened the urban settlements of Jalalpur, the Multan district administration launched an operation to protect these neighbourhoods by building and reinforcing protective dykes along Gilani Road and Shujaabad Road. A breach on Shujaabad Road was swiftly filled using heavy machinery.
The construction of temporary embankments comes as water levels in the Chenab River recede, causing Sutlej’s water to flow towards urban settlements of the tehsil.
Meanwhile, the Jalalpur section of the Multan-Uch Sharif motorway was submerged at over five locations, while efforts were also ongoing to drain water from the Jalalpur Pirwala Motorway M5 Interchange and adjacent areas.
Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Waseem Hamid Sindhu visited Alipur, Khan Bela and adjacent embankments with a technical team and ordered the construction of temporary embankments to contain the flooded Sutlej.
Meanwhile, the evacuation of people continued in Multan and Muzaffargarh districts and Rescue 1122 teams have rescued 28,732 people and 2,998 head of cattle. As many as 9,304 people and 2,998 animals were rescued in Multan and 19,428 people from the Muzaffargarh district along the Chenab.
 
 

As many as 34 people and 14 animals were taken to safe places from Multan during the last 24 hours. The teams also evacuated 24,004 people and 4,437 animals in Jalalpur Pirwala, with 1,144 people and 607 animals during the last 24 hours.
Muzaffargarh Rescue 1122 media coordinator Mansoor Ahmad said that the rescue operation continued in the adjacent low-lying areas near the Chenab and 19,428 people were shifted to safe places. “These areas include Bait Kundrala, Mudwala, Seetpur, Sarki, Khangarh Doma, Lati Marhi, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Kundai, Juna Bangla, Rangpur, Muradabad, Khadkan, Binda Ishaq, and Hamzaywali,” he added.
Two Sehwan villages submerged
In Sindh’s Sehwan, two more villages were submerged as 400,000 cusecs flowed towards Korti Barrage on the Indus. The floodwaters cut off road access to these villages, severing them from Sehwan.
Meanwhile, residents of Waryam Sehto and Aarab Otho villages were seen relocating their livestock and belongings toward safer areas using boats. However, one of the boats malfunctioned during the evacuation. Upon receiving the alert, Rescue 1122 swiftly responded and managed to rescue 35 people along with their livestock and essential household items.
According to the current situation, the water level continues to show a decreasing trend, with inflow at 609,137 cusecs and outflow at 580,927 cusecs at Guddu Barrage.
At Sukkur Barrage, inflow was recorded at 571,800 cusecs, while outflow is at 518,120 cusecs. Besides, the water level showed an increase, with inflow at 300,853 cusecs and outflow at 289,098 cusecs at Kotri Barrage. According to officials, inflow was recorded at 234,755 cusecs, while outflow was at 229,905 cusecs at the Punjab head (Panjnad).

KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar hinted at the possibility of joining a proposed unified front against Israel, if such a move came to fruition.
Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Mr Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, said during an interview with Al Jazeera.
He was responding to a question about the possible position Islam­abad would take in case a united body was formed in the Middle East to stop Israeli aggression.
When asked if the formation of such a body — away from the Uni­ted Nations structure — to intervene in Gaza was one of the options on the table, Mr Dar said that a mechanism could be chalked out.
He mentioned that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League.
“Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [sic], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.”
When asked where nuclear-armed Pakistan would stand, Mr Dar responded: “Pakistan, obvi­o­usly, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty.”
 
 

When pressed to elaborate, he clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.”
“But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged,” he maintained.
The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza.
“So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked.
“We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar.
Need for UN reform
Mr Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”.
“That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious ref­orms.
To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”.
“We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any de-stabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions.
Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented.
“And that might require physical actions, physical interventions,” he mused.
PM’s meetings
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held separate meetings with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iranian Pre­sident Masoud Peze­shkian on the sidelines of the Emergency Arab–Islamic Summit convened in Doha.
In his meeting with Qatari emir, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s strongest condemnation of the Israeli strike on a residential area in Doha on September 9 that led to the loss of precious lives and injured several others, says a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
While reaffirming Pakistan’s all-out support and solidarity with Qatar at this critical time, PM Shehbaz termed Israel’s attack a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a serious breach of international law.
The Qatari emir expressed appreciation for the prime minister’s participation in the Em­e­rgency Arab-Islamic Sum­mit as well as for his visit to Doha on September 12 to express solidarity with Qatar at this difficult time.
During a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s str­ongest condemnation of Israeli aggression against Qatar on Sept 9.
Both leaders expressed their solidarity and support for Qatar and called for unity among the ranks of the Ummah in the face of Israeli aggression.
President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s strong position on the Palestine issue and exp­ressed his desire to continue working closely with the prime minister to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations.

Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB was hearing multiple petitions filed by taxpayers challenging the constitutional vires of the amen­ded Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001, applicable to the tax year 2023.
However, senior counsel Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the Federal Board of Rev­e­nue (FBR), argued that the present case did not involve any question of the National Assembly’s legislative competence.
During the hearing, Add­­i­­tional Attorney Gen­e­ral Chaudhry Aamir Reh­m­an informed the court that the federal governm­ent would submit a written response within a few days.
On April 4, 2024, a division bench of the IHC comprising then Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri while hearing intra-court appeals had directed one of the respondents to continue paying tax liability under Section 4C as amended by the Finance Act, 2023.
The super tax, introduced by the PML-N government in 2015, applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning above Rs500 million. It levies 4 per cent tax on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors to fund rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
Mr Khokhar defended the constitutionality of Sections 4B and 4C of the ITO, 2001, stressing that under Article 77, parliament has exclusive authority to levy taxes. He argued that the super tax, introduced through Finance Acts 2015 and 2022, was a lawful exercise of fiscal power.
He noted that Section 4B, which initially imposed super tax on high-income taxpayers, had already been upheld by all high courts. Issues such as double taxation, violation of Article 25 and legislative competence had been decided in favour of the federation.
Turning to Section 4C, introduced in 2022, which extended the levy through progressive slabs and sector-specific categories, Mr Khokhar said the high courts erred by reconstructing the statutory scheme. This amou­nted to judicial legislation, he argued.
Under Article 199, he emphasized, courts may only strike down laws that clearly violate fundamental rights, not redesign tax schemes. By doing otherwise, the high courts committed judicial overreach and upset the balance of power between legislature and judiciary, he said.
On the claim that super tax constituted double taxation, he called the argument “wholly misconceived,” noting that under Article 77 and Entry 47 of the federal legislative List, parliament has plenary authority to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income.
Section 2(63) of the Ordinance defines “tax” to inc­l­u­­de super tax, while Section 3 provides that income tax shall be charged for each tax year where expressly provided. Thus, super tax is not a separate levy but an additional component of income tax on high-income earners, comparable to a surcharge or advance tax, he explained.

Zalmay Khalilzad, who was named US special representative to Afghanistan during the previous Trump administration, also called on Afghanistan to “help Pakistan with such negotiations”.
The former diplomat recently undertook a visit to Kabul alongside US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, where he met with key members of the Afghan Taliban regime.
In a tweet posted after he wrapped up his visit, Khalilzad noted that violence between Pakistan’s security forces and the TTP had resulted in the deaths of a significant number of security personnel and citizens.

Imran echoes Khalilzad’s views, terms dialogue with Kabul only way to achieve lasting peace

Saying that he believed pursuing a military solution to this challenge was a mistake, he called on Islamabad to “shift to a political strategy and negotiate”.
“The Pakistani establishment always advised the US and Afghan government before 2021 to negotiate and seek a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban. The time has come for Pakistan to consider doing the same,” he said.
 






The timing of the message is significant, as it comes just days after PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir gave Kabul a stark choice.
“I want to give a clear message to Afghanistan to choose between Pakistan and TTP,” PM Shehbaz had said during a visit to Bannu alongside the army chief.
Although President Trump and US military officials such as CENTCOM chief Gen Michael Kurilla have repeatedly praised Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation — with the arrest of IS-Khorasan operative who targeted the Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in 2021 being a highlight — Khalilzad’s message seems to be the first indication that the US wants both Islamabad and Kabul to come to the table.
 
 

In Washington circles, Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.
In a tweet posted just last month, he claimed that Afghanistan’s successful operations against IS-Khorasan had pushed their leadership into Pakistan and alleged that the latter was now becoming a ‘safe haven’ for the militant group.
Imran echoes dialogue call
Khalilzad’s remarks echoed the views of the incarcerated former PM, who has also called for dialogue to address the militancy currently pla­guing the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — where his party is in power.
In a tweet posted to his X account on Tuesday, Mr Khan said that operations initiated in the former tribal areas were leading to rising police, military and civilian casualties.
“This approach can ne­­v­er establish peace. Las­t­ing peace only comes thr­ough dialogue,” he said. He alleged that what was being attempted in KP was merely an atte­mpt to discredit the PTI government, and claimed a military operation would only fuel further terrorism.
As police are diverted to counter the rising threat from terrorism, governance and law and order will collapse, he said. He urged all KP lawmakers to sit with the chief minister to urgently resolve the challenges of the province, and called on his allies — namely Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai — to send a peace delegation to Afghanistan.

The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against match referee Andy Pycroft over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket“, with the board claiming that the referee had asked the Pakistan and India captains “not to shake hands at the time of the toss” for last Sunday’s match.
“Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” the Asian Cricket Council confirmed in a statement on Tuesday ahead of Pakistan’s match against the UAE tomorrow.
The PCB confirmed in a statement later in the day that the board had still not taken a final decision on continuing participation in the Asia Cup.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet taken any final decision regarding the Asia Cup, “PCB spokesperson Amir Mir said in a statement.
He added that consultations are underway in this regard, and a final decision will be taken by tomorrow (Wednesday).
“The decision will be taken keeping in mind the interests of Pakistan,” Mir said.
Officials of both the PCB and the UAE Cricket Board confirmed earlier to Dawn.com that the press conference had been cancelled.
Pakistan men’s team media manager Syed Naeem Ahmed had confirmed to Dawn.com separately that the team would still hold their practice session today.
 






Indian media outlets claimed earlier in the day, citing “unnamed sources”, that the ICC had dismissed the PCB’s complaint seeking the removal of match referee Pycroft from the ongoing Asia Cup over the official’s conduct violation in Pakistan’s match against India.
However, Indian cricket news outlet Cricbuzz reported, “When contacted, the PCB has denied receiving any communication from the ICC.”
The PCB is yet to issue an official statement on the alleged development.
Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had flagged his concerns with the match referee and the tournament director Andy Russel about the Indian team’s behaviour, Pyroft’s own actions at the toss, and the umpires’ role in allowing the Indians to walk off the field without the handshake after the match.
A PCB source, requesting anonymity, told Dawn.com on Monday that Cheema had also approached tournament director Andy Russel with his concerns, upon which he was informed that the match referee had been acting at the behest of the BCCI.
 
 

This compelled the PCB to write to the ICC for the withdrawal of Pycroft from the match officials’ roster for the ongoing Asia Cup.
The PCB official had said that the board is contemplating the withdrawal of Pakistan teams from the Asia Cup if Pycroft continues to officiate the Asia Cup matches. And, the PCB seems prepared for the extreme measure, as Naqvi tweeted on Monday: “There is nothing more important to me than the honour and prestige of my country.”
Pycroft is one of the two match referees — the other being Richie Richardson — that the ICC has nominated for this tournament. He is slated to officiate Pakistan’s next game on Wednesday, against the UAE. Pyrcoft had also officiated Pakistan’s first game of the tournament against Oman.
Pakistan were expected to beat the home side in Dubai tomorrow, and they would have faced neighbours India again on Sunday in the Super 4 round of the Asia Cup.

The World Cup, to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours.
Earlier in the day, veteran batter Sidra Amin smashed a century as The Women in Green set the Proteas a target of 256 to win in the first ODI of the three-match series.
 






South Africa’s reply was led by batters Tazmin Brits and Marizanne Kapp after Sadia Iqbal struck early for the Green Shirts.
They remained unbeaten on 101 and 121 respectively as the Proteas chased down a decent total with 10 balls to spare.
Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana had won the toss and elected to bat first at the Gaddafi Stadium.
Sidra was ably supported by Muneeba Ali as the duo put Pakistan in a strong position to win the first encounter of the three-match series.
Opening batter Muneeba and Sidra anchored the innings with a commanding 147-run stand.
It was Pakistan’s highest second-wicket partnership and third-highest for any wicket in women’s ODIs. The duo brought up the team’s 100 in the 21st over and continued to build momentum, taking the total to 150 by the 31st over.
Muneeba, having reached her 5th half-century, was eventually dismissed for a well-crafted 76 off 94 balls, laced with 11 fours.
Aliya Riaz then joined Sidra at the crease and the pair added a valuable 68 runs off the next 71 deliveries. Aliya contributed a brisk 33 off 34 balls, striking five boundaries, before falling in the 43rd over.
Sidra brought up her 5th ODI century with a delicate dab down to long-on. She remained unbeaten on a superb 121, featuring 12 fours, as Pakistan posted 255-4 at the end of their 50 overs
 


For the Proteas, Ayabonga Khaka returned figures of 9-0-36-2 while Tumi Sekhukhune picked up one wicket for 37 runs in eight overs.
Pakistan had opened their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium.
On Monday, speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima had said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.”
“A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well.
“We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said.
The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad is captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt leads the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.</p><small>2025-09-16 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1617182920934a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942431/ihcs-justice-babar-sattar-orders-removal-of-pta-chairman-over-illegal-appointment-to-office' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar orders removal of PTA chairman over ‘illegal’ appointment to office</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday ordered the removal of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority Chairman retired Major General Hafeezur Rehman due to his “illegal” appointment to the position.
The decision came in a verdict by IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar in a case pertaining to the appointment of the PTA’s member (administration) filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023.
Rehman later filed an urgent intra-court appeal against the verdict.
The order said the court had admitted the petition for hearing and directed the government not to proceed with the hiring, following which the government had filed an appeal for a stay of the court injunction, which was partially accepted, as the court had subsequently allowed the recruitment process to continue while warning that any appointment would be subject to the final determination in the case.
It added that the court was subsequently informed in later hearings that Hafeezur Rehman, a retired major general, was appointed as the member (administration) and then the PTA chairman.
 


In his verdict, Justice Sattar remarked: “The entire process of creation of the post of member (administration), prescription of qualifications and criteria for such post and the manner in which the recruitment process was carried out lacked integrity and suffered from mala fide in law. The recommendation by the selection committee of a panel of three individuals for the appointment to the post of nember (administration) was not in conformance with the requirements of Rule 4(4) of the PTA Appointment Rules, which required that only one candidate could be recommended.
“The decision of the federal government to pick the candidate listed at the bottom of panel recommended by the selection committee on the basis of merit was devoid of any reasoning or objective basis and fell afoul the obligation of the federal government under Section 24A of the General Clauses Act, 1897, to act in a just, fair and reasonable manner.”
The verdict further read: “Similarly, the appointment of respondent No.4 as chairman PTA, after being appointed as member (administration), without any objective or transparent process and without the federal government recording any reasons as to why he was so selected from amongst the members of PTA, was illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law.”
He said the petition was allowed on the above grounds and remarked that the subsequent steps taken by the federal government in filling the post of member (administration) were not sustainable in the eyes of the law and were of no legal effect.
“The entire edifice of processes and decisions built on an illegal foundation must crumble upon such illegal foundation. As the impugned advertisement and the process of recruitment undertaken thereunder suffered from malice in law, all subsequent decisions in pursuit of such process, including the appointment of respondent No.4 as member (administration) and chairman PTA, are illegal, ultra vires the law and of no legal effect.”
Concluding his verdict, the judge said that since the entire process of Rehman’s appointment as the member (administration) and as the PTA chairman was found to “suffer from malice in law being the product of an unconstitutional and illegal recruitment process, he shall cease to hold such appointments and shall immediately relinquish charge for such offices”.
The judge ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till the time that the federal government appointed a regular chairman.</p><small>2025-09-16 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/162206526f791b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942453/pakistan-warns-of-dangerous-escalation-as-unhrc-urges-accountability-for-israels-qatar-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns of ‘dangerous escalation’ as UNHRC urges accountability for Israel’s Qatar attack</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan warned of “dangerous escalation” as the United Nations and a long line of countries on Tuesday denounced Israel’s attack on Qatar last week, demanding “accountability”.
Israel’s strikes on the Qatari capital on September 9 targeted Hamas leaders gathered to discuss a new US ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed.
That strike “was a shocking breach of international law”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said during an urgent debate at the UN Human Rights Council about the strike.
Denouncing the attack as “an assault on regional peace and stability”, he urged “accountability for unlawful killings”.
His words were echoed by Qatar and dozens of country representatives who took the floor during the three-hour debate.
 






Qatari International Cooperation Minister Maryam bint Ali bin Nasser Al-Misnad slammed Israel’s “treacherous attack” and demanded that the international community “take practical steps to hold the aggressors accountable and prevent their impunity”.
“This attack was not an isolated incident, but rather was part of a broader campaign aimed at distorting Qatar’s role and obstructing its diplomatic efforts,” she said.
Pakistan’s ambassador Bilal Ahmad warned that “this unjustifiable and unprovoked attack constitutes a dangerous escalation”.
 






 
 

The council had announced on Monday that it would convene the 10th urgent debate since its creation in 2006, following two official requests from members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Pakistan was among those that led the call for the urgent debate.
‘Shameful’
Neither Israel nor its main ally, the United States, which both disengaged from the council earlier this year, was present for the urgent debate.
But Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, Daniel Meron, lambasted the meeting from the sidelines.
“This marks yet another shameful chapter in the Human Rights Council’s ongoing abuse,” he told journalists.
He accused the council of “serving as a platform for anti-Israel propaganda, while ignoring the brutal realities on the ground and the atrocities committed by Hamas”.
There was little support for Israel’s position during the debate.
European Union ambassador Deike Potzel stressed the bloc’s “principled stance against terrorism in all its forms”, while underlining its “support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar” and calling “on Israel to respect international law”.
“We urge all parties to refrain from any actions that jeopardise mediation channels and regional stability,” she said.
China’s ambassador Chen Xu said his country “firmly rejects and categorically condemns” the September 9 attack, which he charged was “a deliberate attempt to derail the negotiation process”.
Some of the harshest criticism came from South Africa, which has brought a case against Israel before the International Court of Justice, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza.
The attack “strikes against the very heart of mediation processes”, ambassador Mxolisi Nkosi told the council, adding that it “demonstrates that Israel does not want to end its genocidal war against the Palestinian people”.
“It is time for the international community to demonstrate through practical countermeasures that Israel does not enjoy some form of special immunity from accountability.“</p><small>2025-09-16 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/161908197b7bd55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942432/imaan-mazari-moves-sjc-against-ihc-cjs-shunting-of-female-judge-for-taking-up-harassment-complaint-against-him' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari moves SJC against IHC CJ’s shunting of female judge for taking up harassment complaint against him</strong></a><br><p>Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir approached the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Tuesday against Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar after the court administration stripped Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints when she took cognisance of a complaint against him.
Last week, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge. Mazari then filed a complaint a day ago against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
After Justice Imtiaz took cognisance of her complaint, the IHC administration de-notified her as the “competent au­­thority” and replaced her with Justice Ina­­am Ameen Minhas, stripping Justice Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints.
In a post on X today, Mazai said she had filed an addendum to her initial complaint lodged with the SJC against Justice Dogar following yesterday’s “alarming development”. She said Justice Imtiaz was “arbitrarily and with mala fide” removed as the competent authority just a  few hours after she had lodged her complaint and a committee was constituted to inquire into the matter.
 






The additional complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said various IHC organs — registrar office, dispatch branch and member inspection team — had refused to forward her complaint to the competent authority.
“The complaint was then taken directly to the competent authority … Her court associate confirmed receipt of the complaint by providing a receiving on a copy of the complaint in writing in the courtroom. Yesterday’s events showed absolute lack of transparency in relation to the process for registration of complaints under the 2010 act. Furthermore, it highlighted a systematic response/culture of courts, overwhelmingly occupied by men, to not even entertain a complaint of harassment by a woman under the 2010, Act. Eventually, the only female judge (being the competent authority) had to directly entertain the complaint through her staff, after all relevant male officers of the IHC, refused to even receive my complaint.”
Reiterating yesterday’s development, she said Justice Imtiaz had subsequently formed a three-member inquiry team, following which, Justice Dogar “with clear mala fide and in direct conflict of interest” had removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority and replaced her with Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
“No reason whatsoever has been provided in the removal notification. Even if the chief justice (who is a respondent in the complaint) had any objection on the assumption of jurisdiction by the competent authority or the inquiry committee, he could have raised it as an objection in his response to the complaint. Instead, the chief justice opted to exercise his administrative powers as the chief justice to influence the composition and constitution of the inquiry committee and/or competent authority to remove the only female judge, who dared to receive my complaint. Such brazen misconduct within hours after I attempted to seek appropriate remedy and justice is alarming, and reflects the degree of abuse of power prevalent under the IHC chief justice,” the additional request reads.
Mazari also pointed out that cases of hers which were previously not fixed for hearing, were suddenly fixed before Justice Dogar after she filed her complaint. She added that when a proxy counsel appeared on her behalf and requested a case transfer on the grounds of the  pending workplace harassment complaint, “not only was this request not entertained but the IHC chief justice repeatedly tried to drag the proxy counsel into discussion on the incident of harassment. The chief justice, while refusing the transfer request, simply on the basis that the principal counsel (the undersigned) had not appeared before him, then adjourned the matter.”
The lawyer also pointed out that she had additional documentation “reflecting the apparent degree of influence and abuse of authority by the IHC chief justice”, saying that soon after last week’s incident, a case was lodged against her in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA).
She said on Friday last week, a notification was issued by the Ministry of Interior nominating a special prosecution team in her case. Furthermore, she said a challan was submitted against her in a trial court yesterday and she came to know by media reports and then by a voice note sent by an NCCIA officer that she was summoned in the matter on Wednesday.
“At the time of filing this, I have yet to receive a summons/notice through formal court process. It appears to be more than a mere coincident that soon after the harassment incident and the filing of complaint, a challan in a case that involves incidents pertaining to past four years (i.e. 2021-2025) has hastily been filed in trial court and the trial court (working as subordinate judiciary under the IHC chief justice) has immediately fixed it for hearing.”
Mazari urged the SJC to read the additional complaint and documentation as part of her previous complaint against Justice Dogar. “I request the members of the SJC to take up my complaint and initiate proceedings against Mr Dogar at the earliest as such brazen misconduct and unchecked exercise of coercive power affects my legal practice and the clients I represent on a daily basis,” she concluded.
She made the following request to the SJC secretary: “Due to the dire nature of this complaint and the ensuing consequences, I urge you to convey the contents of this complaint to the honourable members of the SJC urgently upon receipt of this post.”
Reference seeking cancellation of Mazari’s licence filed in Islamabad Bar Council
Separately, a lawyer filed a reference before the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) seeking the cancellation of Mazari’s practising licence for her alleged involvement in “anti-state activities” and a “smear campaign against state functionaries”.
The reference, filed by Advocate Adnan Iqbal and a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated: “The complainant has received some information from credible sources that Mst. Imaan Zainab Mazari Hazir has been involved on a number of occasions in anti-state activities like hate speeches against the state institutions and the honourable heads of government departments, negative and smear campaign against state functionaries and law enforcement agencies, and instigating hatred and rebellion against vital institutions of the state.”
 
 

It requested the IBC chairman and its disciplinary committee to initiate an inquiry against Mazari and “permanently cancel her licence to practice as an advocate”. “During the inquiry, her licence may kindly be suspended till final verdict of the worthy disciplinary committee,” it added.
The reference was filed under Section 41 of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act 1973 (punishment of advocates for misconduct), read with Chapter X (disciplinary proceedings) of its 1976 rules and the Islamabad Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules 2017.
The reference alleged there was “strong persuasive evidence” against Mazari for her “close connections with anti-state organisations”, such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement leader Manzoor Pashteen.
“She has been supporting the cause of every movement which has the agenda of rebellion against the state and its vital institutions. She could be seen delivering speeches, chanting fiery slogans against the state and its institutions on every such stage adorned for launching anti-state campaign,” it further claimed.</p><small>2025-09-16 14:14</small></div><hr>
