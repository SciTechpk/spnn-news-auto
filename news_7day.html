Governor blames RAW for terrorism wave
Talking to the media, the governor said that there was ‘evidence’ that Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) was involved in the recent wave of terrorism in Pakistan.
He said the motive of the hostile neighbour was to spread chaos in the country, but the Pakistani nation was united to foil such nefarious designs.
He said the nation along with the armed forces of Pakistan had given a befitting reply to the enemy on May 10. The governor vowed to give an active response to RAW and its facilitators.
Talking to reporters, MQM-P leader Dr Sattar said that the situation in Balochistan had deteriorated to an extent that innocent passengers from other parts of the country were being targeted.
He said that his party would not sit idle until “RAW and Indian proxies are eliminated from Pakistani soil”.

Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
“Something I’m very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,” Trump said.
“You had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.
“It was getting worse and worse, wasn’t it? […] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their nuclear capability, totally knocked out,” he said, referring to the US strikes on Iran’s three nuclear sites.
 


Pakistan claimed it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, the Pakistan Air Force downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
India also claimed it downed “a few planes” of Pakistan. Islamabad has denied any losses of planes but acknowledged that three air bases suffered hits, while saying that 26 Indian targets were hit.
Trump has repeatedly said he prevented a “nuclear war” between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even crediting Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration doubled down on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.
Asked about Indian officials’ repeated denials of Trump’s role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.
Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.”
Trump’s statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.
India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
 
 

India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism.
The April attack in Pahalgam killed 26 men and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.
New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p><small>2025-07-19 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191039300387215.jpg?r=103936' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925071/govt-to-compensate-flood-and-rain-hit-people-punjab-assembly-told' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to compensate flood and rain-hit people, Punjab Assembly told</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman told the Punjab Assembly on Friday that the government will announce support for those adversely impacted by the inclement weather prevailing in the country.
“The MPAs whose districts have experienced devastation [due to rains and flooding] should identify those areas, and the government will compensate farmers for their losses there,” the minister stated in response to a demand by the treasury MPA, Mehwish Sultana, seeking that the flood-affected areas be declared calamity-hit.
Acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the ongoing monsoon, the minister said: “We have received more rainfall than expected during the season,” confirming that the government has decided to provide financial assistance to compensate for the damages caused by the rains. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would soon announce financial aid for the bereaved families of those who died in the calamities, while those who have suffered financial losses will also be compensated,“ he added.
 
 

The session also saw a heated debate regarding alleged corruption within the Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department. Treasury member Ahsan Raza directly accused the shrines’ custodians (matawallis) of corruption and demanded accountability for the funds donated to various shrines. “Where has the money from philanthropists gone? We are facing corruption,” the MPA said.
Admitting corruption within the department, Parliamentary Secretary for Auqaf, Malik Waheed, said: “Which department doesn’t have corruption, but we are trying to run the system in a better way.” He, however, urged the members to provide evidence of corruption. “If corruption has occurred anywhere in the department, point it out, and I will conduct an audit and present it to the house.”
During the session, three new legislative drafts were introduced by Punjab Law Minister Sohaib Bharath – The Punjab Agricultural Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2025, The Punjab Horticulture Authority Bill 2025, and The Punjab Senior Citizens Welfare Bill 2025.
Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar referred all the bills to the relevant committees for review for a period of two months.
Upon completing the agenda, the chair adjourned the assembly proceedings until 2pm on Tuesday. Before adjourning, he announced that the Senate election for a general seat in Punjab would be held in the assembly on Monday. Voting will take place from 9am to 4pm. Special cards have been issued to MPAs for the polls and no one will be allowed to cast a vote without the card, he said.
Earlier, the session began over two hours behind its schedule. Prayers (Fateha) were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent floods, rains and storms across the province.
Opposition’s ‘public assembly’
In a show of solidarity with their suspended colleagues, the opposition PTI lawmakers staged a “public assembly” outside the provincial house. This unconventional session served as a platform for the opposition to voice their strong criticism of the government on various fronts, including the handling of recent floods, rising commodity prices and alleged political victimisation.
Ejaz Shafi, acting as the speaker for this “outdoor” assembly, allowed the opposition members to speak on points of order.
MPA Imtiaz Sheikh fiercely criticised the government, stating that the development projects being showcased by the administration have been “washed away in floodwaters.” Retired Col Shoaib Awan and Tayyab Rashid also joined in, accusing the chief minister of engaging in political theatrics and suppressing the opposition. They highlighted the dire situation in Punjab, asserting that the province is “drowning,” crops are submerged and houses are destroyed, yet the government remains “indifferent.”
Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar declared, “Until our suspended members are reinstated, we will not enter the assembly.” He painted a grim picture of Punjab’s current state, saying that the situation has become “quite critical.”
Bhachar criticised the government’s response to the floods, saying the calamity has exposed the weaknesses of its development projects. He pointed out the massive human cost, with “63 people dead and 290 injured” due to rains and floods, asking, “Who is responsible for this?”
He also attacked the government on economic issues, highlighting the drastic increase in petrol prices from Rs134 to Rs272 in a coupleof years, asking, “Who is the thief?” He further alleged that the sugar mafia has taken over the province.
Bhachar highlighted the alleged restrictions on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan in meeting the party leaders and workers in jail. He accused the government of “doing everything to suppress the PTI.”
He also presented a resolution against the devastation caused by floods and the soaring prices of sugar and petrol, that was passed by the “public assembly.” Following the completion of the agenda, Shafi adjourned the “session” indefinitely.

The tariff is based on an average five per cent unrecoverable bills and is indexed to inflation and exchange rate variations for a six-year period ending in FY30.
The newly approved multi-year tariff (FY24-FY30) for KE is over Rs8 per unit higher than the national average tariff of Rs31.59 per unit notified for the current year. This means taxpayers will bear the additional cost through the federal budget in order to maintain uniform electricity rates across the country.
“Notwithstanding the notification of the attached decision of the Authority, the consumers of K-Electric shall not be charged the tariff outlined therein; rather, they shall be charged the uniform tariff as applicable to the consumers of ex-Wapda Discos as determined by Nepra and notified under the Act from time to time, in accordance with paragraph 5.6.3 of the National Electricity Policy, 2021”, Nepra said in gazette notification issued on Friday.
Last month, the Power Division announced that it had challenged Nepra’s May 27 determination on KE’s multi-year tariff, alleging that it had extended nearly Rs750 billion in undue financial favour to the private utility over seven years — at the cost of the national exchequer, consumers across the country, and taxpayers.
In a statement issued on June 2, the Power Division said that six separate tariff interventions approved by the regulator would result in a financial impact of about Rs453bn over seven years. Additionally, the higher fuel cost benchmark for FY25 alone would result in an extra Rs41bn burden, which, even if held flat, could amount to Rs287bn over the full control period.
Despite the formal challenge, Nepra did not acknowledge the Power Division’s review petition in its gazette notification.
The Power Division further alleged that Nepra had allowed KE to include losses in its tariff that were not actually incurred, with an estimated seven-year financial impact of over Rs200bn. It maintained that only actual losses, following a proper write-off process, should be permitted.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claimed that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan, attended by various chambers via Zoom.
The strike call was initially issued by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators.
“We have not supported the KCCI strike as it was announced by one chamber alone,” Mr Magoon said. He maintained that the FPCCI, representing chambers from across the country — including Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Multan, Khanewal, Sheikhupura, Sargodha, Quetta, and Peshawar — had unanimously decided to postpone the strike after the government agreed to address major concerns related to the Finance Act 2025.
“Only the KCCI and the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) are not on the same page,” he added, dismissing the possibility of a decisive nationwide strike.

FPCCI ‘postpones’ strike; Karachi Chamber sticks to shutdown in absence of written commitment

However, KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani insisted that a peaceful strike would be observed on Saturday, having secured backing from numerous trade and industrial organisations. “If the government fails to provide written assurances following our meeting with SAPM Haroon Akhtar, we will be compelled to extend the strike. We are not satisfied with verbal commitments,” Mr Bilwani said, warning that further shutdowns could extend to multiple days or even the full week.
 
 

Criticising the bureaucracy, he noted, “Businessmen work seven days a week, while government officials work only five.”
He warned that unresolved issues may force industries to relocate abroad, particularly to Dubai.
KCCI has expressed serious objections to Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act, which it says grant sweeping and arbitrary powers to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Mr Bilwani said the decision to go ahead with the strike was reaffirmed after an unfruitful meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on July 16, during which demands to suspend five key anti-business measures remained unmet.
These include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, repeal of Section 21(S) which penalises cash transactions above Rs200,000, scrapping of Section 40C mandating the e-Bilty system, revocation of SRO 709 introducing a disputed digital invoicing system, and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
LCCI President Mian Abu Zar Shaad stated that the chamber had decided to join the strike in solidarity with the broader business community. “The problems persist despite meetings with the government. We now demand implementation rather than assurances,” he said.
Meanwhile, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh told the media that a charter of demands had been presented to Mr Haroon, who agreed to withdraw the contentious measures. “There will be no strike on Saturday,” Mr Sheikh claimed, adding that the SAPM’s recommendations would be forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

In a message on the occasion of Kashmir Accession Day, he affirmed that the government and people of Pakistan will continue to extend diplomatic, moral and political support to Kashmiris.
“Kashmir Accession Day is celebrated every year on July 19, in memory of the Srinagar session of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference held in 1947,” he noted.
 
 

“On that day, the brave people of Kashmir passed a resolution to accede to Pakistan for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.”
He said the story of the Kashmiri people’s unending sacrifices, which began in 1947, continues to this day. Despite the brutal oppression, the “spirit of Kashmiri people remains unbroken. In fact, their desire for freedom has only grown stronger over time”.

In a three-two majority decision, the CB had ruled that the transfer of three judges from different high courts to the IHC was in accordance with the Constitution.
The petition, filed through senior counsel Idrees Ashraf on behalf of ex-PM Khan, contended that the June 19 judgement treated permanently transferred judges differently in terms of emoluments and privileges under Article 200, creating inequality among similarly placed judges — a move that is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
This is the eighth such appeal filed before the apex court. The earlier petitions were by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — as well as by the Lahore High Court Bar Association, Lahore Bar Association, Karachi Bar Association, PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen, Raja Muqsid Nawaz Khan and Riasat Ali Azad.
In his petition, Mr Khan argued that the CB had failed to distinguish between the “functions” and “powers” of the president under the Constitution, as he performed functions only on the advice of the cabinet or the prime minister.
The reference to “powers” in the June 19 order, the petition argued, erroneously implied autonomy that was constitutionally impermissible. Article 200 neither granted nor implied any independent discretion to the president to initiate or finalise judicial transfers, the petition said, adding that as a ceremonial head, the president always acted on the advice of the executive.

Argues CB order eroded judicial independence, bypassed appointment process, violated equality among judges

The CB erred in remanding the matter to determine whether the transfer was “temporary” or “permanent”, describing it as a judicial question. Delegating it to the president, the petition added, undermined judicial autonomy and violated the principle of separation of powers.
 
 

Articles 200(1) and 200(2), which have existed in tandem since the 1956 Constitution, indicated that judicial transfers were temporary, the petition  contended, adding that Clause (2), which stated that the transferee judge continued affiliation with the original high court, reinforced this temporariness.
Interpreting such transfers as “permanent” required inserting language not found in the constitutional text — a judicial overreach amounting to rewriting the Constitution, the petition stated.
Unlike India, where Article 217 explicitly declares a vacancy upon transfer, Pakistan’s Constitution does not create such a vacancy.
Therefore, a transferred judge retained affiliation with their parent high court and original seniority, the petition said.
Seniority, it argued, was an administrative matter within the judiciary, not an executive function. Allowing the president to determine seniority risked executive interference in the judicial hierarchy and autonomy, the petition contended.
Article 175-A governs judicial appointments and does not overlap with Article 200. Interpreting Article 200 to allow filling vacancies through transfers renders Article 175-A redundant and creates constitutional disharmony.
Moreover, treating permanently transferred judges differently in terms of emoluments and privileges under Article 200 results in inequality among similarly situated judges, which is discriminatory and unconstitutional.

During an interaction with a select group of reporters on Friday, Mr Naqvi said the plan was meant for the smooth coordination of the civil armed forces, which fall under the interior ministry, with the military and other stakeholders for effective counterterrorism operations.
One of the proposals was to ap­­point a retired or serving two-star general to head this wing, he added.
The minister noted that paramilitary and civil armed forces including the Frontier Corps, Rangers, Pakistan Coast Guard, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and newly established Federal Constabulary that fall under the administrative control of his ministry were involved in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency operations across Pakistan.
 
 

“There is a need for smooth coordination of the civil armed forces department with all stakeholders to improve delivery, efficiency, and end the pendency,” he said, explaining that several options were being considered including the appointment of a retired or serving major general to head this department.
He made it clear that such an appointee would work under the interior secretary and would have nothing to do with the working of other departments of the ministry, which deal with internal security, immigration and anti-corruption.
He said that the necessity of a federal force had arisen, which paved the way for the conversion of the Frontier Constabulary into a nationwide ‘Federal Constabu­lary’. He assured that the decision would have no impact on the personnel already serving in the force.

Separately, Muhamad Zubair, 36, was sleeping in a room near Aara village when a falling rock hit the roof, causing it to cave. Zubair died at the spot while the two other persons were injured.
Meanwhile, scores of villages in Chakwal were still plunged into darkness as the power supply could not be restored even after three days.
According to Iesco, 99 high tension and 48 low tension poles and 65 transformers were damaged due to intense rainfall.
Iesco Superintendent Engineer Waheed Ahmed Abbasi told Dawn it would take at least 48 hours to fully restore the power supply.

A heavy monsoon spell on Thursday claimed over 60 lives and left almost 300 citizens injured in just 24 hours — mostly in Punjab’s northern districts — prompting the authorities to put emergency services on high alert.
Rawalpindi was among the worst-hit districts where torrential rains triggered a flash flood in Leh Nullah, inundating the city and its suburbs. In Chakwal, the overflowing River Soan — into which Leh Nullah flows — breached a dam, flooding entire villages in the district and parts of Jhelum. The army had to be deployed to rescue hundreds of people stranded on rooftops or elevated areas. While less affected districts like Lahore experienced another round of urban flooding, they were spared a major disaster, despite showers throughout the day.
 
 

According to the disaster management authorities, the intensity of the monsoons this year is 60pc to 70pc higher than it was last year. The authorities are now warning of at least four more heavy monsoon spells — similar in strength to Thursday’s — before the end of August. These warnings have brought back disturbing memories of the devastating floods of 2022. Yet no province, much to the chagrin of vulnerable communities in the country, has prepared itself to tackle such a situation.
While climate change has undeniably made this year’s monsoon more intense, especially in Punjab, it would be disingenuous — if not outright irresponsible — to use that as an excuse for administrative failures year after year. As in past years, the ongoing showers have again exposed the authorities’ lack of preparedness and their failure to implement the steps needed to mitigate the crisis despite early warnings of excessive rains from the disaster management agencies ahead of the rainy season. Those only blaming climate change are, in effect, attempting to absolve themselves of accountability for bad urban planning and poor governance.
 
 

The billions spent by the provincial government on publicity campaigns to boost its political image could have, instead, been used to strengthen Punjab’s defences against flooding in the cities and improve disaster management and emergency response systems. Politicians often speak of the need for climate adaptation and resilience to tackle extreme weather events. Yet, most places remain underfunded and neglected.
The devastation in northern Punjab highlights the urgent need for a fully funded, comprehensive climate adaptation strategy to address both structural vulnerabilities and institutional inefficiencies. Thursday’s events must be seen not as an isolated disaster, but as a warning of what lies ahead. Unless we act now, we will find ourselves trapped in the same conversation, mourning greater loss of life and bearing new economic burdens. The cost of continued inaction always exceeds the price of prevention.

And yet, astonishingly, the most predictable health threats associated with the season are routinely neglected.
The most common monsoon health hazards include: acute watery diarrhoea and cholera, especially in Sindh and southern Punjab, where flooding contaminates drinking water; dengue and malaria outbreaks, common in urban lowlands like Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar due to standing water and poor drainage; skin infections, scabies and leptospirosis in displaced populations; maternal and child health crises, particularly in hard-to-reach flood-affected areas where routine services collapse.
The Met Department issues repeated advisories about monsoons and its intensity, but response prioritisation at the national level remains inconsistent. In theory, the NDMA coordinates with the Ministry of National Health Services and provincial health departments to preposition stockpiles (for example, cholera and antimalarial kits).
In practice, response remains post-disaster, not anticipatory. Some glaring examples can be traced back to the 2022 floods. Response teams arrived after major outbreaks had begun and did not anticipate preventive action. The National Institute of Health (NIH) maintains an Emerg­ency Operations Centre and disease surveillance unit, but real-time district-level health risk analysis is rarely available to front-line responders in advance. There’s no standardised health risk heat map integrated into the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) monsoon preparedness plans, and health supplies are rarely pre-deployed based on forecasted risk.
In Pakistan, trigger-based health action is limited to “simplified early action protocols” by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society for floods (for example, in the Kabul River basin) focused on WASH and cash; no health kit pre-deployments have been activated as yet. By contrast, Bangla­desh established early action protocols across sectors, including health, WASH and cash triggered by riverine flooding forecasts, and Nepal has been piloting anticipatory health responses in recent years, mainly around floods and food security. Where finance-based forecasting is concerned, Pakistan mainly uses pilots through PRC plus the International Federation of Red Cross for heatwaves, droughts and floods that remain small in scale, whereas Bangladesh has institutionalised FbF at the national level with pre-approved finance and scenario-based triggers. In Nepal, active plots are embedded in DRR strategies, often tied into food security anticipatory schemes. Integration into local health programmes is weak in Pakistan, with ad hoc coordination between PDMA and the health department. Nepal has integrated community clinics into a pre-activation mechanism viz the FbF task force.
The government buy-in for anticipatory health remains siloed. The monsoon contingency is led by NDMA and not integrated into health planning. Bangladesh launched an early action protocol in 2019 under its disaster management & relief ministry that targets multiple sectors, including health, and Nepal is taking steps towards formally including health in DRR and climate planning via federal initiatives and donor programmes.

In practice, response remains post-disaster, not anticipatory.

While Bangladesh has institutionalised anticipatory health action, particularly in cyclone and flood-prone districts, linking it to national health supply chains and forecast-based triggers, Pakistan remains reliant on post-disaster surge capacity, with no formal anticipatory health activation system at the provincial level. Some of the challenges in provincial disaster systems are:
Fragmented governance: In most provinces, health and disaster management departments do not share real-time risk or stockpile information. There is no unified logistics platform (for instance, digital inventory dashboards or GIS-based heatmaps) integrating forecasted flood zones with vulnerable health infrastructure.
Weak institutional mandates: PDMA planning documents (like monsoon contingency plans) often mention disease risk in general terms, without assigning clear anticipatory roles to district health officers or logistics focal person.
Operational capacity gaps; For example, in Balochistan and KP, flood-prone areas like Dera Allah Yar or D.I. Khan lack cold-chain storage or mobile health capacity that can be pre-positioned or activated based on risk forecasts.
Finance and procurement lags: Even when forecasts allow for seven-to-10-day early warning, emergency health funding is rarely unlocked in time due to central-level approval bottlenecks and procurement delays.
Lack of coordination with non-state actors: INGOs and UN agencies often run parallel anticipatory pilots, but these are not integrated into government SOPs, creating duplication or misalignment in logistics planning.
However, despite long-standing structural gaps, there are important signs of progress in aligning health and disaster preparedness in Pakistan. In 2023, the NDMA piloted a joint monsoon simulation exercise with the NIH and provincial stakeholders, marking a first step toward unified early planning; the country’s National Adaptation Plan now explicitly references climate-sensitive disease surveillance and heat-health action plans, signalling a growing awareness of health risks in a changing climate; donor-supported systems such as the WHO and Early Warning Alert and Response Network are slowly improving post-disaster disease tracking and analysis in flood-affected regions.
However, progress remains piecemeal and project-based. Without sustained provincial ownership, cross-sector coordination, and dedicated domestic financing, anticipatory health logistics will continue to be the exception not the norm. With rising temperatures, more intense monsoons, and the shifting geography of disease vectors, climate change is no longer a distant threat. It is a health emergency unfolding in real time.
Pakistan needs to: formally embed anticipatory health action into disaster risk management protocols; ensure such efforts are resourced through health sector budgets, rather than relying solely on donor-driven projects; build systems that are backed by real time data, integrated early warning and multisector planning.
Pakistan needs a ‘Climate and Health Resilience Policy’ that bridges institutions, anticipates climate-driven disease threats, and enables action before and not after the next outbreak.

One hopes it marks the beginning of system-wide changes in our antiqua­ted administrative structure and processes. This experiment’s success will depend not only on the calibre of the newcomers but also on the way the supporting ecosystem evolves. To begin with, scre­ening, short-listing and interviewing should follow objective parameters — for instance, mat­ching ex­­p­erience with job requirements, a demonstrated record of adaptability and innovation, strong interpersonal skills and problem-solving abilities.
The risks in this pilot should be recognised. Those selected will either conform to existing pra­ctices and make only cosmetic changes to survive, while the more conscientious ones would quit, reinforcing the belief of proponents of the present system that outsiders are not fit for the job.
What changes are needed to revamp the ecosystem? Those selected through this open, competitive process should enter into performance agreements with key performance indicators and be given the authority, resources and powers to discharge their duties while being held accountable for non-performance, nepotism, favouritism, corruption, etc. Every file from the secretary should not end up at the PM Office or CM Secretariat. A lack of trust in secretaries, second-guessing their judgement and looking for pliable or gullible individuals to toe the line undermines the dispensation of unbiased advice. Presently, those who don’t toe the line are shown the door. Thus merit and experience are disregarded. To prevent this, security of tenure should be guaranteed.
The main obstacle faced by newcomers are the 1973 Rules of Business — a colonial legacy not meant for a developing state. The first task is to revise these Rules as civil servants are bound to act in strict compliance with the processes and procedures embodied in this compendium. They are encouraged to maintain the status quo rather than to promote a dynamic and modern administrative structure. Too much emphasis on ritualistic compliance with procedures, rules and form has replaced concerns about the outcome for welfare and justice. Secretaries and heads of departments should be empowered to take decisions without multiple references, clearances, approvals and concurrences. Financial, administrative and procurement powers should be delegated in proportion to authority. The separation of functions and responsibilities across the Secretariat, the attached departments and autonomous bodies should be incorporated in the Rules to expedite the execution of policies and programmes. In the current weak system of audit and public procurement, compliance with outdated procedures rather than considerations for value for money, discourages principal accounting officers from pursuing effective low-cost solutions and risk-taking. Not taking decisions has become the norm

Without changes to the hierarchy, newcomers can’t introduce efficiency to governance.

Newly recruited secretaries can’t work in isolation but at the apex of the entire chain of command. If changes are not made to the hierarchy, one can’t expect the new incumbents to introduce efficiency to the governance structure. Each division’s tiers should be reduced from six to three and the staff-officer ratio should be at 2:1 following the adoption of e-government.
The key to the high-quality performance of public sector institutions lies in attracting, retaining and motivating civil servants of high calibre and integrity throughout the system — at the entry, middle management and top levels. These can be accomplished by introducing a merit-based recr­ui­tment system, continuous training and skill upgradation, objective performance evaluation linked to promotions and increments, early retirement of non-performers, equal opportunity in career progression, adequate compensation, proper performance evaluation, financial accountability and result-oriented compliance.
Monetising all perks and reducing the size of the Grades 1-16 staff can free up resources for paying higher cash compensation to mid-level and top managers and experts. A proposal to establish a ‘National Executive Service’ where all government officers, cadre, non-cadre and ex cadre, compete transparently after reaching Grade 19 to fill higher Secretariat positions with high pay scales, supplemented by laterally inducted technical experts, is already on the table. Success at the entry level examination at 24 years should not entitle one to reach the top without regard for performance and potential.
Public services, such as education, healthcare, potable water, sewage and waste disposal, and pu­­blic transportation, are best performed at the lo­­cal level; sadly, the lack of professional expertise hinders the capacity of elected local governments. Citizens are met by unqualified and rude clerical and junior officials. A reversal of roles is needed, whereby young and competent officers serve on the front lines of metropolitan corporations, municipal committees, district and tehsil councils. Assistant and deputy commissioners, assistant and superintendents of police and district executive officers of devolved departments should be legally empowered to resolve citizens’ issues.
One way to improve transparency and accountability, reduce transaction costs, provide convenience to citizens, minimise arbitrary discretionary powers, curb corruption and track performance and output is through digitalisation and e-government tools. Mandatory training in e-filing, messaging, document sharing, retrieval, reporting and archiving will smoothen the transition from a paper-based environment.
Along with e-government, another way to introduce a citizen-centric approach is by simplifying the rules and regulations, codifying and updating them and widely disseminating them through websites, data centres or information kiosks. Online access to government functionaries and e-filing for services can help enforce internal accountability, while allowing citizens to conduct hassle-free transactions. The establishment manual, accounting and audit rules, finance manuals and procurement rules should be revised to align with modern management practices. These manuals, after being updated, should be uploaded on to government websites to be easily accessible to all within and outside the government.
In sum, inducting professionals from outside government will work only if selection is open, competitive and based on merit, the Rules of Business are changed, the system-wide value chain from induction to severance is strengthened, hierarchical tiers are reduced, service delivery is entrusted to competent officers at the local level, e-government is practised and manuals and rules and procedures are aligned with modern management practices.

The sugar industry and meat export in Sudan, and encouraging Pakistani private sector stakeholders to explore investment in sugar processing, technology transfer, and slaughterhouse infrastructure are pivotal sectors in which Pakistan can join, Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, told Sudanese Ambassador to Pakistan, Salih Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Siddig, during a meeting here on Friday.
Reaffirming his commitment to transforming Pakistan into a hub of international agricultural cooperation, Mr Hussain said that such partnerships will not only contribute to regional prosperity but also align with Pakistan’s broader agenda of achieving sustainable development through strategic diplomacy and innovation in agriculture.
The minister enlightened the Sudanese envoy the ministry’s vision to forge new international agricultural alliances that align Pakistan’s strategic objectives of enhancing food security, boosting investment, and promoting South-South cooperation.

Minister tells Sudanese envoy such partnerships will enhance food security

The minister emphasised the deep-rooted cultural, religious, and historical relations between Pakistan and Sudan, describing them as a solid foundation for stronger collaboration in agricultural trade, education, and technology.
He briefed the Sudanese ambassador on Pakistan’s advanced research institutions and technical expertise in crop production, irrigation, and livestock health as ideal resources for Sudan’s agricultural development ambitions.
Sudanese Ambassador Salih Mohamed informed the minister about Sudan’s demographic composition and reaffirmed the goodwill and trust that exists between the two nations.
Mr Tanveer took note of the geopolitical situation in Sudan and appreciated the country’s efforts to maintain peace in the post-secession era.  He reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to cooperate in humanitarian and development domains through sustainable agriculture-based solutions.
He welcomed Sudan’s keen interest in educational collaboration, particularly in securing additional seats for Sudanese students at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad.
Mr Hussain further noted the health standards upheld by Sudan in its livestock exports to Gulf markets and recognised the country’s strength in producing disease-free meat.
He encouraged closer cooperation in veterinary science, breeding, and poultry management, ensuring Pakistan’s support in providing technical assistance where needed.
He also appreciated the contribution of the Pakistani diaspora in Sudan, especially in skilled trades and technical services.

Presiding over a meeting on civil service reforms, the PM said the civil service played a key role in the practical performance and implementation of the government’s policies across various ministries and sectors.
Calling the comprehensive and effective reform of the civil service a government’s priority, he directed the inclusion of input from public representatives and those of government officials in administrative and institutional reforms of the civil service.
Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal briefed the prime minister on the proposed civil service reforms. He said there was significant room for improvement in the current system of recruitment, promotion, training, and capacity building of government officials within the civil service structure.

Unveils plan to hand out e-bikes to students on merit; thousands of EVs to be provided on easy govt-supported loans

E-bikes for students
While heading a meeting on Electric Vehicles (EV), the PM said  encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) would help save billions  of dollars in valuable foreign exchange spent on fuel, support  environmental protection efforts, and promote the local industry.
The prime minister directed officials to prepare a comprehensive action plan to make electric vehicles accessible to the common citizen. He announced that the federal government would provide electric bikes to top-performing students of all educational boards across the country including the federal board.
He vowed that jobless individuals would be provided with electric rickshaws and loaders on priority. He ordered a third-party validation of the entire process of EV distribution and the government support mechanism to ensure transparency.
The PM directed the launch of awareness campaign about the government assistance programmes for obtaining EVs.
A briefing was given in the meeting regarding the current status of EV manufacturers and the government’s supportive measures to make them accessible to the common people.
The meeting was informed that the government was taking steps to facilitate the acquisition of electric bikes, rickshaws, and loaders through low-cost loans and easy terms. It was further apprised that over 100,000 electric bikes and over 300,000 loaders would be made available to the public under easy loans and at low costs through government support.
The meeting was informed that under this scheme, students who perform well at the intermediate level would be provided free electric bikes, while a special quota of 25 per cent was allocated for women. The remaining quota was distributed among the provinces based on population ratio, the PM was briefed. However, he directed the officials concerned to increase Balochistan’s quota up to 10 per cent.
Due to this scheme, the meeting was told, four new battery manufacturing companies were commencing operations in the country.

• Plan hinges on withdrawal of five ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates
• Peshawar chapter livid after its president denied ticket in favour of ‘affluent individual’
• Candidate denies late-night media reports on withdrawal from race
• JUI-F senator claims his party turned down ‘last-minute offer’ from PTI
PESHAWAR: As political parties hold negotiations over seat adjustments for the upcoming Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI’s Peshawar chapter seems to be at odds with the party leadership and has vowed to contest the polls independently.
On Thursday night, leaders of opposition parties had met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at the CM House to chalk out the modalities of seat adjustment.
The opposition delegation was led by KP Assembly Opposition Leader Dr Ibadullah.
Sources said that the initial understanding developed would see the PTI get six out of 11 Senate seats, comprising four general, one technocrat and one reserved for women.
In contrast, the opposition would receive five seats, including two seats each for JUI-F and PPP (one general and one technocrat each), and one general seat for the PML-N.
This agreement, however, hinges on the withdrawal of PTI candidates Irfan Saleem, Ayesha Bano, Irshad Hussain, Khurram Zeeshan and Waqas Orakzai. But these candidates are seemingly bent upon contesting elections and have refused to bow to party pressure.
In an attempt to defuse the crisis, the PTI’s top leadership, including Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and General Secretary Salman Akram Raja rushed to Peshawar and held talks with the dissidents on Friday.
At least two rounds of meetings remained inconclusive, and the party’s 38-member political committee was expected to make a final decision.
While there was no official word from either side till the filing of this report after midnight, media reports suggested the final round of PTI meeting ended, with the protesting aspirants agreeing to withdraw from the contest.
However, one of the candidates while talking to Dawn denied the media reports, explaining that they had not taken any such decision in the meeting.
Insiders said that the body may like to stick to the deal negotiated with the opposition. If that is the case, then the dissenting PTI figures are unlikely to withdraw their candidature.
Earlier, Irfan Saleem told Dawn that the PTI-opposition arrangement benefits only “pro-establishment elements”.
“Given the current scenario, we’re not ready to withdraw. The number of Senate seats PTI is getting under this arrangement is less than our actual strength in the provincial assembly,” he said.
But he added that if the PTI’s share in the Senate seats could be increased, they were ready to withdraw their candidacy.
‘Peshawar’s Imran Khan’
On the other hand, PTI’s Peshawar chapter has been up in arms against the party leadership for ignoring workers in the process of awarding Senate
tickets, and has threatened to stage a protest outside CM House and lay seige to the KP Assembly on polling day.
The rift deepened following the denial of a Senate ticket to Mr  Saleem, a longstanding party worker and president of PTI’s Peshawar chapter.
“Irfan Saleem is Peshawar’s Imran Khan,” said former district general secretary Jalal Khan at a press conference at Peshawar Press Club on Friday. He was joined by former city president Ihtisham Khan and several tehsil heads.
He said that Mr Saleem had been associated with the PTI for the last 23 years and has rendered tremendous sacrifices for the party before and after the May 9, 2023, violent protests.
“PTI workers in Peshawar were happy when Irfan Saleem was nominated, as he had previously been denied tickets for both the National and provincial assemblies,” he added.
Jalal Khan accused the leadership of dropping Mr Saleem in favour of affluent candidate Mirza Afridi.
He said Mr Saleem suffered a lot at the hands of the law enforcement agencies after the May 9 events, whereas Mr Afridi condemned the incident during a press conference, contrary to party policy.
He also alleged that Mr Saleem’s name was removed from the list of candidates through a conspiracy orchestrated by Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif.
On July 15, the PTI KP chapter had recommended five names to Chairman Barrister Gohar for general seats, including Murad Saeed, Irfan Saleem, Faisal Javed, Khurram Zeeshan and Azhar Mashwani.
A letter accompanying the recommendations said the names were listed “in order of priority, reflecting their dedication, service to the party and ability to represent PTI’s vision at the national level”.
However, Irfan Saleem’s name was dropped following a meeting between Imran Khan and Barrister Saif at Adiala Jail, reportedly to accommodate Mirza Afridi.
JUI-F ‘not interested’
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza told DawnNewsTV on Friday that the PTI had also approached it for a potential alliance for the Senate elections.
Mr Murtaza said a senior PTI leader had recently contacted him to propose contesting the Senate elections jointly.
However, the JUI-F has turned down the offer, citing its prior  commitment to other opposition parties.
“I told PTI that we have already  given our word,” Mr Murtaza said, confirming that the JUI-F would not  entertain a last-minute alliance with PTI.

• Law introduced to meet EU’s GSP+ conditions requiring limitation of death penalty to the ‘most serious crimes’
• PTI leader slams govt over ‘poor’ disaster response
ISLAMABAD: A bill seeking to abolish the death penalty for harbouring hijackers and for publicly stripping a woman of her clothes was among the four bills passed by the Senate amidst voices of dissent from both sides of the aisle.
The Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, aimed at aligning Pakistan’s laws with its international obligations under the GSP+ trade agreement with the European Union (EU), which requires limiting capital punishment to the most serious crimes, was moved in the House by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
The bill proposes the replacement of the death penalty under Sections 354-A and 402-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with life imprisonment.
Currently, Section 354-A states: “Whoever assaults or uses criminal force against any woman, strips her of her clothes, and exposes her in public shall be punished with death or life imprisonment, along with a fine.”
PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar remarked that the crime of stripping a woman in public is as serious as murder and stressed that death penalty for this offence should remain unchanged.
Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir questioned whether the death penalty for terrorism would be abolished.
Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) lawmaker Samina Mumtaz Zehri observed that the laws concerning crimes against women should be made stricter, not lenient. She warned that easing punishments would embolden criminals. She pointed out that the conviction rate in such cases is already low due to weak prosecution, and emphasised the need for reforms in the police and judicial systems.
“This is not right. This is not going to help the country or its people,” she said, opposing the amendment.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, argued that harsh sentences did not necessarily deter crime. He cited the example of European countries where death penalty did not exist, yet the crime rate ws just 2pc.
He added that in Pakistan, the death penalty currently applied to over a hundred offences. He noted the punishment for stripping a woman in public was originally seven-year imprisonment, and was converted to capital punishment during the regime of Gen Zia in 1982.
The Senate also passed the Extra­dition (Amendment) Bill to address procedural delays in extradition requests, and the Pakistan Citizen­ship Act (Amendment) Bill, enabling Pakistani diaspora members to resume their Pakistani citizenship.
Poor disaster response
Meanwhile, the government came under fire in the Senate over what was described as a lack of preparedness that led to loss of lives and immense suffering during the recent rains.
Speaking on a point of public importance, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar said: “The loss of precious lives and the severe hardships faced by the people due to the recent rains are a clear indication of the government’s unacceptable negligence and incompetence.”
He stressed that this was not the first instance. Despite early warnings from the meteorological department about the monsoon’s arrival, government institutions were not prepared.
He noted: “Roads and neighbourhoods were flooded, people were forced to spend nights on rooftops, and the state machinery remained a silent spectator. This wasn’t just a natural disaster — it was a failure of governance.”
He raised critical question is there any effective system in place at the government level to deal with emergencies or not? The people go through the same ordeal every year, and the government makes the same old promises and explanations every year.
He urged the chair that the House should be told: “Where were the NDMA and the provincial institutions? where was the emergency plan? what steps were taken to improve the electricity, water and sanitation systems? Why was immediate assistance not provided to the victims?
Mr Zafar demanded a comprehensive report on the government’s response to the rains and called for the formation of a special parliamentary committee to investigate the matter and suggest reforms to prevent such negligence in the future.
He concluded: “It is not only the right of those who lost their lives, but the constitutional and moral responsibility of the state to protect the life, property, and dignity of every citizen. For God’s sake, don’t wait for the next disaster. Reform now so that no mother is forced to search for her child in floodwaters again.”
In response, the Deputy Chairman, who was presiding over the session, said a detailed discussion on the matter would be held on Monday, as several motions were scheduled.
However, Ali Zafar pressed again: “Deputy Chairman Sahib, the time for debate is over. Don’t wait — act now. Decide on the proposed committee.”
The chair stated that it was not only the responsibility of the federal government but also of the four provincial governments to act during such emergencies. As other members stood to speak, the chair concluded the session, citing the approaching time for Friday prayers.

Thai police this week arrested a woman accused of bedding at least 11    monks in violation of their vows of celibacy, before blackmailing them with thousands of secretly taken photos of their trysts.
The monks are said to have paid nearly $12 million, funnelled out of their monasteries, funded by donations from laypeople hoping to increase their merit and prospects for reincarnation.
The scandal provoked outrage over hypocrisy in the monkhood, concern that their status shields them from scrutiny, and soul-searching across society about the role of religion.

“I’m not involved in the religion like I used to be,” 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver Mongkol Sudathip told AFP. “I don’t have full respect for it anymore.”
King Maha Vajiralongkorn has cancelled invitations to more than 80 monks who had been due to attend his upcoming 73rd birthday celebrations, citing “inappropriate behaviour that caused mental distress among the Thai people”.
While the 11 monks have been stripped of their robes, the kingdom’s National Office of Buddhism has vowed to “restore public trust” with a sweeping police probe into the grubby affair.
‘Splurging attitude’
Theravada Buddhism has been the spiritual backbone of Thai identity for more than two millennia, and still shapes national laws banning alcohol on religious holidays and protecting sacred objects.
Thai men are traditionally expected to ordain as monks at least once in their lives for a period lasting as short as a few weeks or as long as decades.
The clergy are bound by 227 strict rules, including a ban on masturbation, touching women and even handling objects directly from them.
Monks traditionally survive on alms, food offerings and a modest $170 monthly stipend, but some pocket fees for lectures, blessings and ceremonies — blurring the line between faith and fortune.

In a TV interview, the woman at the heart of the scandal said she had developed a “splurging attitude” as her monk lovers lavished her with shopping trips worth up to $90,000 a day.
Motorcycle taxi driver Mongkol said he now prefers to donate to hospitals or schools for underprivileged children. “It feels more meaningful than giving money to temples,” he told AFP.
This month’s scandal is not the first to rock the monkhood.
In 2017, police raided Wat Dhammakaya temple north of Bangkok, arresting its former abbot over allegations of laundering $33m in public donations.
This May, police held another monk in the capital over allegations of embezzling nearly $10m from a temple for an online gambling network.

Buddhism scholar Danai Preechapermprasit said repeated scandals — especially among senior monks — have “shaken people to the core”.
“People question whether donations are used for spiritual significance or personal desire,” he told AFP. “I think Thailand has reached a point where it’s difficult for monks to even walk down the street.”
A powerful lawmaker has pledged tighter regulations within three months, including mandatory donation disclosures and laws treating monk misconduct as a criminal offence.
“This case does not represent Buddhism as a whole,” said national police chief Kitrat Panphet on Thursday, pledging a new task force to probe misbehaving monks. “It’s about a few individuals doing wrong,” he said.
‘Never lose faith’
In Buddhist tradition, monks are viewed as the Buddha’s spiritual heirs, entrusted with preserving and passing on his teachings.
But at Wat Bowonniwet in Bangkok, one of Thailand’s most revered temples, only 26 monks were ordained this year, a steep drop from nearly 100 before the Covid-19 pandemic.
A monk there, speaking to AFP anonymously, blamed societal changes after the pandemic, which forced people into isolation, saying nowadays “people prefer to live outside the temple life”.
But independent Buddhism expert Jaturong Jongarsa said temples are increasingly being treated as “a garbage dump”, where families send drug addicts or LGBTQ youth to be “corrected”.
“Temples are no longer seen as the sacred spaces they once were,” he told AFP. “People send their problems to the temple and hope they’ll go away.”
Still, not all Thais have lost faith.
Camphun Parimiphut, a 52-year-old security guard from Maha Sarakham in Thailand’s northeast, said: “Buddhism is about the teachings, not the individuals who fail it”.
Because of corruption scandals, he now avoids giving money to monks, preferring to donate only food. But his devotion remains steadfast.
“You can lose faith in monks,” he said. “But never lose trust in Buddhist teachings. They still teach us how to live a good life. “</p><small>2025-07-18 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18233800ab0e6e3.jpg?r=234058' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925037/us-rejects-who-global-pandemic-response-accord' target='_blank'><strong>US rejects WHO global pandemic response accord</strong></a><br><p>The United States has rejected an agreement adopted by members of the World Health Organisation to improve preparedness for future pandemics following the disjointed global response to Covid-19, the American government said on Friday.
The State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement they had transmitted on Friday the official US rejection of the legally binding pact, which was adopted in Geneva in May after three years of negotiations.
The pact aims to ensure that drugs, therapeutics and vaccines are globally accessible when the next pandemic hits. It requires participating manufacturers to allocate a target of 20 per cent of their vaccines, medicines and tests to the WHO during a pandemic to ensure poorer countries have access.
US negotiators left discussions about the accord after President Donald Trump began a 12-month process of withdrawing the US, by far the WHO’s largest financial backer, from the agency when he took office in January. Its exit means the US would not be bound by the pact.
“Developed without adequate public input, these amendments expand the role of the WHO in public health emergencies, create additional authorities for the WHO for shaping pandemic declarations, and promote the WHO’s ability to facilitate ‘equitable access’ of health commodities,” the US statement said.
“Terminology throughout the 2024 amendments is vague and broad, risking WHO-coordinated international responses that focus on political issues like solidarity, rather than rapid and effective actions,” said the statement, jointly issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy, who has a long history of sowing doubt about vaccine safety, had slammed WHO in a video address to the Assembly during its vote, saying it had failed to learn from the lessons of the pandemic with the new agreement.
Kennedy and Rubio said on Friday that the rejection protects US sovereignty. The pact leaves health policy to national governments and contains nothing that overrides national sovereignty, however.</p><small>2025-07-18 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181926180b5eff0.jpg?r=192813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924989/medium-level-flood-at-punjabs-kalabagh-and-chashma-on-indus-river-due-to-monsoon-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood at Punjab’s Kalabagh and Chashma on Indus River due to monsoon rains</strong></a><br><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh and Chashma on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, prompting the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to issue a high-level flood warning for the two points, as water flows surged due to heavy monsoon rains.
Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc and claimed at least 63 lives across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.
“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and glacial melting,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.
According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 6pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage with falling water inflow and outflow at the former, and rising flows at the latter.
There was a low-level flood at Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm.
By 6pm, water flow around at Guddu was normal, while Sukkur and Tarbela were still registering low flood.

In view of the situation, the PDMA issued a warning for an expected high-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma during the next 24 hours.
“Activate flood monitoring and early warning systems,” the advisory said. It also ordered authorities to strengthen embankments, establish relief and medical camps, as well as stockpile essential medicines and food.
According to NDMA’s website, 15 people have died across the country in the last 24 hours as a result of the rains, while 53 have been injured. Eleven of these deaths were reported from Punjab.
Since June 26, 193 people have lost their lives in rain-related incidents across the country and 544 others have been injured, the website data said.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 114 deaths and 437 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 21, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.
In a statement, the PDMA urged residents living alongside the rivers to evacuate the areas with their cattle. “The Punjab government will fully take care of you and your livestock,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia was quoted as saying.
Alerts had been issued to the Sargodha and Dera Ghazi Khan commissioners as well as the deputy commissioners of Mianwali, Layyah, Bhakkar, Kot Addu, Rajanpur and Muzaffargarh.
It directed the local administration, the agricultural, health, wildlife, livestock and transport departments, and Rescue 1122 to remain alert and be fully prepared. The PDMA stressed to ensure ample fuel stock for rescue operations.
 


Flood level at Kalabagh has been moderate since at least 6am, according to data issued by the PDMA earlier today.
In a statement, the authority said that the water levels at the Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej rivers were normal, as well as those at Dera Ghazi Khan’s irrigation system.
“The water level in Mangla Dam is 47 per cent and 79pc in Tarbela, whereas the water levels in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi are up to 36pc,” said the statement.
Rains continue in Lahore, expected in south Punjab & Sindh
Meanwhile, rains continued in Lahore, with the city recording as much as 111mm of rainfall at Nakhuda Chowk, according to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa).

According to a PMD advisory issued at 7:15pm, a system of rain is present over south Punjab’s DG Khan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Sadiqabad and surrounding areas which is likely to reach Sindh’s Ghotki, Sukkur, Kashmore, Jacobabad, Lazgan, Khairpur, Sanghal, Umerkot and Mirpur Khas due to which rain with strong winds and thundershowers are expected in the above mentioned areas during the next 3 to 5 hours.
Yesterday, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and left dozens dead.
This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by APP.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza, in a statement, directed the Lahore Electric Supply Company to ensure uninterrupted power supply. He advised citizens to avoid electric cables and poles, as well as areas where water accumulates.
 






Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed and Vice-Chairman Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmad visited various low-lying areas of Lahore, including Nakhuda Chowk, Bhaati Gate, Circular Road, Akbari Gate, Delhi Gate and Kotwali.
The Wasa top officials were briefed on the water drainage operations, a statement by the agency said. Ghufran ordered the teams to speed up their efforts and ensure that the machinery was fully functional.
 






Over 1,000 rescued along Potohar plateau: PDMA
Amid the ongoing situation, the PDMA DG directed the administration to stay on high alert.
“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.
Detailing the PDMA’s rescue efforts in a statement, he said that “more than 1,000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.
“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” Kathia claimed.
The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.
 


DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.
Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.
Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.
According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.
Widespread monsoon rains expected across KP from July 20-25: Met Office
Another spell of monsoon rains accompanied by wind and thundershowers across most parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from the evening of July 20 to July 25, according to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to the Peshawar Regional Met Office, a new monsoon weather system is expected to enter the province during the said period. The system is likely to be further intensified by an incoming westerly wave, which may result in widespread rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds in multiple districts.
The areas likely to be affected include Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral (Upper & Lower), Dir (Upper & Lower), Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan (Upper & Lower), Kolai Pallas Kohistan, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, and North and South Waziristan (Upper & Lower).
The KP PDMA warned that the rains may include scattered heavy to very heavy downpours in some areas, along with lightning and strong winds, which may pose risks of urban flooding, landslides in hilly terrain, and disruption in daily routines.
Through a letter to all deputy commissioners, the PDMA has advised the authorities across the province to remain alert and take precautionary measures during the forecast period. The public and tourists too have been advised to take precautionary measures.

Pakistan and the US concluded a critical round of trade negotiations earlier this month, reaching an understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors.
While both sides reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb had a “productive meeting” with Lutnick and Greer in Washington DC, with both sides satisfied with progress made in enhancing trade ties.
“They (Pakistan and the US) reaffirmed their commitment to exploring opportunities to strengthen these ties in all possible areas of mutual benefit,” the statement read.
“Finance Minister Aurangzeb emphasised that the US remains Pakistan’s largest trading partner and underscored Pakistan’s interest in expanding cooperation in both traditional and non-traditional sectors, including IT and tech sector, minerals, and agriculture, to foster a mutually beneficial relationship.”
According to the finance ministry, both parties “expressed optimism” that ongoing trade talks would yield positive outcomes and economic benefits for Islamabad and Washington.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.

Sawan, also known as Shravana, is considered a holy month in the Hindu calendar where many observe fasts and refrain from consuming meat, alcohol and even onions and garlic, according to Indian daily The Hindu.
The Hindu reported that a group of demonstrators stormed the outlet in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh and confronted the staff, demanding that the restaurant’s operations be stopped.
“Visuals of the incident circulated widely on social media showed members of the outfit carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans such as ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’, while forcibly pulling down the shutter of the KFC outlet,” the newspaper added.
 






According to The Times of India, Pinky Chaudhary, the chief of the group, said, “Our message is clear: we are asking that all non-vegetarian outlets to refrain from serving such food during the Kanwar Yatra. If they want to remain open, they should serve vegetarian options only.”
The Hindu reported that opposition parties assailed the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the incident, holding it responsible for “a deterioration in law and order”.
The Indian Congress party’s National Secretary, Shahnawaz Alam, was quoted by the newspaper as saying: “Such actions are a violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. When there is no ban, how can individuals storm a food chain and force it to shut down?
“It is a design to create disorder in society through groups that have become mainstream after the BJP assumed power. Holy occasions are being used to fuel tension on communal lines,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-18 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/182001101e2feb2.jpg?r=200137' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925028/humaira-asghar-case-report-finds-no-sedatives-or-any-toxic-substance-in-body' target='_blank'><strong>Humaira Asghar case: report finds no sedatives or any toxic substance in body</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi University laboratory on basis of samples sent from actor Humaira Asghar’s body came to the conclusion that there were no traces of sedative or toxic substance in it, raising a strong possibility that the medico-legal section will likely to declare it as a “natural death”, it emerged on Friday according to a report and police officials.
A police investigative report released on Wednesday found that the evidence so far indicated that the actor’s death — whose body was discovered in a Karachi apartment on July 8 — was accidental or due to natural causes.
“No traces of any sedative, psychiatric, narcotics or any poisonous substances are found,” according to the contents of the report prepared by experts associated with the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences of Karachi University (KU) and obtained by Dawn.com.
The Gizri police had sent the samples of the 42-year-old actor’s hair, lung and liver collected by Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Doctor Bakhtawar Khan on July 8. The KU lab performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) technique to analyse the said samples, the report said.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the police have received the report of the late actor’s body samples.
The senior officer hinted at the possibility that medico-legal officers and doctors would likely call it a “natural death”.
The South DIG said the investigators have also obtained the “medical history of the late actor from a private hospital in Clifton in the recent past”.
South-DIG Raza said that investigators have also received a DNA report from Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology Laboratory at the KU. Sharing findings of the forensic lab, the senior officer said the report stated that there was a “human blood on a stain section taken from shirt and trousers of Humaira Asghar.”
However, the DIG said it was a “meager amount of blood that might have been caused by biting insects.” He said as per concerned procedure, the MLOs and doctors would determine the exact cause of death in light of these findings of the both labs of the KU.
He said the police would submit the reports to the doctors and they expected that they would give their final version about cause of death on Monday.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore last week following a sparsely-attended funeral.
Earlier in the month, police formed a special investigation team to probe the actor’s death, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment on July 8.
The notification calling for the formation of the investigation team had directed them to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed had confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
 
 

The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing arts, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays.

Due to the widening trade gap and higher external debt servicing, the country posted a current account deficit of $103 million in May compared to a $47m surplus in the preceding month and $1.2bn in March.
According to SBP data, the current account saw a surplus of $2.1bn, compared to a deficit of $2.1bn during the previous fiscal year.
 






Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted the developments in a post on X, stating that the surplus was the highest in 22 years.
“[The] country’s current account for June 2025 closes in $328m surplus, taking full-year surplus to over $2.1bn,” he wrote.
Schehzad added that remittances surged by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach a “historic” $38bn.
He added that in the current fiscal year, textile exports increased by 7.4pc year-on-year to $17.9bn, while IT (information technology) and IT-enabled services exports climbed to $4.6bn — a year-on-year increase of 44pc.
“Last, but not the least, [the] Pakistan Equities Market (KSE-100) crossed 140,000 points, making a historic mark in its history, with market value crossing Rs 16.8 trillion (close to $60bn),” he wrote.
 






Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the current account surplus, calling it “very welcome”.
“Foreign exchange reserves have exceeded $19bn due to government measures,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from his office.
“The main reason for the stability in current account surplus is a significant increase in remittances and exports,” he added. “Improving financial and economic indicators show that the country’s economy is on the path of stability.”
Commending his team, the PM said that the government is taking priority steps to provide a business and investment-friendly environment in the country, according to the statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18193444c66bbfe.png?r=193650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925022/fo-says-pakistan-has-dismantled-terrorist-outfits-amid-us-designation-of-group-blamed-for-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>FO says Pakistan has ‘dismantled’ terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.
The statement follows the US State Department’s decision on Thursday to designate a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) — responsible for the Pahalgam attack — as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.
The April 22 attack — which resulted in the deaths of 26 people — sparked a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
According to a BBC News report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
“TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,” the State Department said in a statement.
In a statement today, the FO said, “Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities.
“Pakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,” it added.
“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.”
The FO highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, including the apprehension of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the “mastermind” of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport.
The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were “still inconclusive”.
“While the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,” it added.
The FO’s statement also urged the international community to “adopt objective and non-discriminatory policies” to address terrorism.
“Terrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),” the FO asserted.
In 2022, an anti-terrorism court awarded a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart­ment.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 removed Pakistan from a list of countries under “increased monitoring”, also known as the “grey list”, after four years.
“It has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,” then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181855368e515e3.jpg?r=185602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925023/13000-to-15000-pakistani-students-go-to-uk-for-permanent-residence-every-year-senate-panel-told' target='_blank'><strong>13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to UK for permanent residence every year, Senate panel told</strong></a><br><p>Around 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the United Kingdom for permanent residence every year, a Foreign Office (FO) official told the Senate on Friday.
“Every year, 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the UK for permanent residence,” a FO representative told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis in a meeting chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada.
“Pakistani students prefer to settle in the UK rather than return to the country,” the official added.
“These students are willing to work even for minimum wage.”
According to the official, Pakistani students then become part of the UK labour market.
The FO representative told the panel that there are currently 1.8 million Pakistanis living in the UK.
“Pakistani citizens face difficulties [in the UK] due to lack of English proficiency,” the official added.
Earlier in the week, UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
On Wednesday, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK.
In May, a British government official said that the government may restrict visa applications from students living in countries — including Pakistan — that are considered most likely to claim asylum in a move designed to bring down annual net migration.
The move came after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party was punished in local elections in England last week by voters angry over issues, including illegal immigration.</p><small>2025-07-18 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181505518810c8c.jpg?r=150613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001/2-martyred-2-injured-as-gunmen-attack-balochistan-constabulary-convoy-in-mastung-govt' target='_blank'><strong>2 martyred, 2 injured as gunmen attack Balochistan Constabulary convoy in Mastung: govt</strong></a><br><p>A Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a blast that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.
According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.”
“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.
Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.
He continued, “Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.”
“A formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,” he added.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing Fitna-Al-Hindustan — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
 






Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.
“According to initial reports, the acting DSP’s vehicle was targeted,” Rind said in a statement.
The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.
Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.
The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.
On July 16, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an attack on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.
In a separate incident on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162937d2d0756.jpg?r=162946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925009/security-forces-foil-infiltration-bid-by-terrorists-on-pak-afghan-border-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported on Friday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“Pakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by Khawarij along the Pak-Afghan border,” PTV News reported, citing security sources.
Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
PTV said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, Khawarij tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.
“The Khawarij advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,” the state broadcaster said.
All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.
Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, PTV added.
“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the Khawarij separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” PTV News said.
ASI, constable injured in quadcopter attack: police
A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP’s Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.
“The injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,” DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was “crucial for combating terrorists in the district”.
The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.
“National unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,” the DPO said “Police alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.”
Earlier this month, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.
On July 9, security forces killed eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.
Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:11</small></div><hr>
