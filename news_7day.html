The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president.
Strict security measures were enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom.
The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain.
It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani.
Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action.
Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants.
According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today.
However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said.
As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location.
Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers.

 

He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear.
Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest.
They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials.
The Islamabad Bar Council, IHCBA, and the district bar association jointly condemned the arrests, terming them an attack on the legal fraternity and the rule of law. Bar members warned that if such actions continued, a movement similar to the 2007 lawyers’ movement could be launched.
Further, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest.
Talking to Dawn, Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council.
He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said.
Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence.
The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings.
Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted.
‘Fascism at its peak’
Earlier in the day, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.”
The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association “sadly could do nothing”.
“Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X.







Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors.







In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”.
“All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said, referring to the case against Imaan and Hadi over controversial social media posts.
“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post.
‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’
The ex-minister shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest.







“We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X.
He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.”
Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk.
The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car.
He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle.







Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”.
He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike.
“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted.
Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”.



The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple.
The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday.
The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers.
“The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.



The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident.
It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”.
The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”.
Cases against the duo
The main case against Imaan and Hadi, which pertains to a controversial social media post, stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year.
ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances.
Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

 

Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, about a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC has granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025.

In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Trump appeared unaware that 457 British soldiers died during the conflict, following the September 11 attacks on the United States.
“They’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,” Trump told the US outlet, referring to Nato allies. “And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he added.



Trump also repeated his suggestion that Nato would not come to the aid of the United States if asked to do so.
In fact, following the 9/11 attacks, the UK and several other allies joined the US in Afghanistan from 2001 after it invoked Nato’s collective security clause, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which treats an act of aggression against one or more members as an attack on all.

 

As well as British forces, troops from other Nato ally countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and others also died.
“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato forces was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesman said.
“We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.”
‘Heroes’
Care Minister Stephen Kinnock earlier said he expected Starmer would bring the issue up with Trump.
“I think he will, I’m sure, be raising this issue with the president … He’s incredibly proud of our armed forces, and he will make that clear to the president,” he told LBC Radio.
“It just doesn’t really add up what he said, because the fact of the matter is the only time that Article 5 has been invoked was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11,” he added in an interview with Sky News.
Defence Minister John Healey said Nato’s Article 5 has only been triggered once.
“The UK and Nato allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan,” he said. The troops who died were “heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.”
Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died aged 18 in Afghanistan, told The Mirror newspaper that Trump’s remarks were “extremely upsetting”.
Emily Thornberry, chair of the British parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, denounced them as “so much more than a mistake”.
“It’s an absolute insult. It’s an insult to 457 families who lost someone in Afghanistan. How dare he say we weren’t on the front line?” the Labour Party politician said on the BBC’s Question Time programme on Thursday evening.



According to official UK figures, 405 of the 457 British casualties who died in Afghanistan were killed in hostile military action.
The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.</p><small>2026-01-23 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23170959c580643.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968619/death-toll-from-karachis-gul-plaza-inferno-reaches-71-search-operation-in-final-stages' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno reaches 71; search operation in ‘final stages’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll of Karachi’s Gul Plaza blaze crossed 70 on Friday as rescuers found more remains from the rubble of the gutted shopping centre.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed issued an updated list of 71 deceased. Of the 16 identified so far, nine were identified through DNA tests, which have been performed for 49 samples.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed.
As more bodies were recovered from different parts of the building, officials cautioned that the final toll can only be determined once the identification of the remains is completed.
Meanwhile, officials expressed the hope to complete their search efforts on Friday.
South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told reporters that the search operation was in the “final stages”. “The search in the wreckage will be completed today,” he said.
Stating that a total of 77 missing persons had been reported, he said the recovery efforts were being made under the supervision of the Sindh Building and Control Authority’s (SBCA) team.

 

The director general (DG) of Sindh Rescue 1122, Brigadier (retd) Wajid Sibghatullah Mahar, said rescue personnel were to continue their recovery efforts in “10 to 15 per cent” of the building’s area that they had been unable to access before.
“There are some concerns that we have not been able to reach the ground floor, where the fire erupted. We hope to find bodies from there,” the Rescue 1122 DG told the media.
Defending Rescue 1122’s efforts, Mahar asserted that the teams had modern equipment, the inferno had turned into a third-degree fireby the time rescue personnel reached the site.
The official further said that 15 to 20 people were rescued and evacuated when the blaze erupted.
“Either the fire safety system was not present in the building, or it was not activated,” Mahar said. He revealed that the latest technology had been used over the past three days to aid the search process, in order to locate any individual who survived the blaze.
The Rescue 1122 DG added that based on the information so far, the fire erupted in a flower shop, from where it spread through the duct. However, he added, the police were still investigating why the fire spread quickly.
CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures after Gul Plaza tragedy
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also briefed the provincial assembly on the incident on Friday, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance.
Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution.
About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people.
The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation.
“This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted.



The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year.
“My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said.
He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans.
The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years.
The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed.
He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.
‘FIR to be registered based on info so far’
CM Murad informed the Sindh Assembly that the fire erupted at a ground-floor shop at 10:14pm on January 17, with the first call received by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) from a shop owner’s son.

The first fire brigade was dispatched at 10:27pm from a fire station near the Civil Hospital Karachi, Murad said, adding that Rescue 1122 received the first call at 10:36pm. “We have also verified these records through CCTV.”
The Sindh CM said that he has issued directives to a minister to register a first information report (FIR) of the incident based on the information so far.
“Whoever is responsible for this will be punished,” he vowed, adding that he was withholding some details for now.
“Wherever government institutions have any negligence, they will get punishment accordingly […] including me, if I have been negligent.”
The chief minister also noted that people had gathered at the site in large numbers despite being told not to when the rescue operation began.
During his address, CM Murad also took a jibe at those “politicising” the incident and bringing up the topic of the 18th Amendment — an apparent reference to remarks made by leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).

 

At this point, Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq interrupted the chief minister’s speech, at which Sindh Assembly Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah repeatedly asked the former to sit down or leave the hall.
Later during his speech, the chief minister asserted, “They do not understand the Constitution […] Where is it written that the Centre can control any part of a province? There is no such thing.”
The chief minister also went into the history of Gul Plaza, noting that the then-Karachi Municipal Committee had transferred the place in the name of the East India Company in 1884. In the 1980s, the building was sold with the then-Karachi Building Control Authority approving the plans for it.
Pointing out that the 99-year lease was not renewed as due in 1983, the Sindh CM said it was finally renewed in 1991 — “after the building had been constructed”.
“Who was the Karachi mayor on 28/9/1991 who approved the lease before the 18th Amendment?” Murad asked, adding that it was Farooq Sattar. He also noted that an ordinance was passed in 2001, followed by the regularisation of shops with the mayor’s approval in 2003.</p><small>2026-01-23 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23154515742a64f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968615/snow-blankets-parts-of-kp-murree-met-office-forecasts-more-rain-snow-from-jan-25-27' target='_blank'><strong>Snow blankets parts of KP, Murree; Met Office forecasts more rain, snow from Jan 25-27</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER/ SHANGLA/ RAWALPINDI: Commuters and residents faced difficulties on Thursday as snow blanketed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Murree.
While a restriction was placed on the entry of vehicles into Murree, a rescue operation was under way in Tirah.
Meanwhile, the Met Office said more rain and snowfall was expected in different areas from Sunday night till Tuesday under the influence of a westerly wave.
Rescue efforts in Tirah
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said on Friday that a comprehensive rescue operation was ongoing to help the people affected by heavy snowfall in the province.
“The operation is ongoing in Tirah valley, Painda Cheena, Dawatoi and Bagh Maidan on the directives of Rescue 1122 director general,” he said in a statement.
“Twenty-three operational vehicles of Rescue 1122 and rescue teams comprising more than 100 personnel are taking part in the rescue operation,” he said.
In an update at 5:30pm, Rescue 1122 said 50 stranded vehicles and around 100 affected people had been rescued in Tirah.
“The affected people have been shifted to safer locations, and the rescue operation is ongoing,” the Rescue 1122 statement said.
It should be mentioned that the residents of Tirah have been vacating their homes amid a planned military operation against militants in the restive valley. Hundreds of displaced families were stranded on the road on Thursday due to the prolonged registration process, which was suspended in the evening due to heavy snowfall that began in earlier in the day.
A statement issued by the Khyber Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) office on Friday said efforts were underway under the directives of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to shift internally displaced persons (IDPs) stranded due to recent snowfall to safe locations.
“The stranded families were shifted to Painda Cheena School and hostel, and a consignment of relief goods was also delivered at the location during the night,” it said.
The statement further said that all the families were provided with blankets, while children were given sweaters and other essential items.
“Due to timely relief operations by the provincial government, Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps and the district administration, all families remained safe. All affected families were provided immediate relief,” the statement said.
According to the DC office, relief activities continued from Nangrosa to Dawatoi and from Dawatoi to Bagh Maidan.
“Under the supervision of Rescue 1122 teams, children and women were evacuated first, followed by men,” it said. Rescue and relief operations continued late into the night to ensure that all families could be rescued, the DC office said.
On Thursday night, KP CM Afridi had highlighted that the people of Tirah were stranded in the snowfall due to the “forced evacuation”.
“The district administration as well as the resources of the entire province are being used to help them. People are trapped in about three places,” he said.
Afridi said some people were being transported to nearby homes as well as to areas designated by the district administration. He also said that contact could not be established with some people due to a lack of mobile signals and blocked roads.
“I am personally monitoring all the rescue activities. All departments have been instructed to rescue people and provide relief,” he said.







Shangla receives heavy snowfall
Meanwhile, KP’s Shangla district received a heavy amoung of snowfall, blocking major roads, including the Karakoram Highway, and disrupting the power supply to most areas.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), snowfall was reported in most parts of the province’s north on Thursday night, which continued till Friday morning.
It said the heavy snowfall caused the blockade of roads in various districts. However, efforts were underway to reopen the roads.
Attaullah Khan, a resident of Kotkay, told Dawn that his village had received 17 inches of snow last night. He said residents were anticipating that this snow would resolve the water shortage in during the spring.
“I remember this heavy and constant snow was received in our village years ago. We are totally dependent on snow because we use spring water which comes from the mountain tops,” Khan said.
Bakht Alam Khan, the tehsil council chairman of Chakesar, said the community had been praying for snowfall. He said a prolonged snow drought had severely affected agriculture and worsened water shortages in the area.
He said the road blockades due to the snowfall was temporary but would also help them fulfil their water needs.
Shujat Ali Khan told Dawn that Bisham had last received snowfall in 2013. He said the weather had brought joy to the people, especially the children.
Restriction on entry of vehicles into Murree
Snowfall also started in Murree on Thursday evening, and a Met official told Dawn on Friday afternoon that some areas in the city had received up to two feet of snow until then.
“Up to 14 inches of snow was recorded in the Sunny Bank area while Galliyat and areas in the north of the city experienced even more snowfall,” he said.
Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that a restriction had been placed on the entry of vehicles in the city in view of the weather situation.
However, no road had been closed thus far, and tourists who had reached Murree earlier were getting around the city without any restriction.
The district administration was monitoring the situation, he added.
District Emergency Officer Kamran Rashid told Dawn that some vehicles got stuck at Chitta Mor and near Mussiaree on the Murree Expressway, but they had been rescued.
Building collapse in Lower Chitral
In Lower Chitral’s Damel, at least six people were killed in a building collapse caused by landsliding, according to a Rescue 1122 statement.
The statement said four people had been reported missing, and the site of the incident was located in a remote area.
Weather forecast
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast more rain and snowfall from Sunday night till Tuesday in different parts of the country.
“A westerly wave is likely to approach western parts of the country on January 25 (Sunday) and likely to grip upper parts of the country on January 26,” the Met Office said.

In the wake of the arrest, journalists and parliamentarians issued strong condemnations and urged justice for the two lawyers.
Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court today in the controversial tweets case, after failing to appear yesterday despite repeated summons.
Opposition Leader Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said in a post on X that the arrest of the lawyers on their way to court “highlighted the troubling pattern of state overreach and procedural irregularities that undermine the principles of fair trial and due process enshrined in Pakistani laws and international conventions”.
“Such actions by the state not only expose institutional weaknesses but risk a complete judicial breakdown, eroding public trust in the rule of law,” he said.
The opposition leader added that Imaan and Hadi should be immediately presented for bail and allowed to defend themselves.
“Stop silencing dissent and the advocates of human rights,” Abbas said.







The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance strongly condemned the arrest, stating in a post on X that the arrest is being treated as an “attack on civil liberties”.
“Strong reactions are being witnessed across the country in political, legal and human rights circles,” the TTAP said.
“In a statement issued by the spokesperson of the movement, it was said that the Constitution of Pakistan grants every citizen full right to peaceful political activities and freedom of expression; however, in the current situation, these constitutional rights are being continuously violated,” it added.
The alliance said that arrests of this nature not only weaken the democratic system “but also promote an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in society”.







The TTAP “demanded that supremacy of the Constitution and law be ensured in the country, the chain of political revenge be stopped immediately, and basic rights of all political and social activists be protected”.
It added that in the National Assembly, TTAP chief and opposition leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said on the floor of the house that targeting people based on political viewpoints is a violation of the Constitution and democratic values.
“He said that freedom of expression and basic civil rights in the country are being continuously snatched away,” the statement said.
Achakzai was further quoted as saying that using the law to defend the interests of “powerful people” was condemnable and eroding the public’s faith in state institutions. The TTAP chief demanded Imaan and Hadi’s immediate release and a transparent and impartial probe into their arrest.
Human rights body Amnesty International termed Imaan and Hadi’s arrest “the latest escalation in a sustained campaign of judicial harassment and intimidation by the Pakistani authorities” in a statement on X.
Amnesty noted that the couple was arrested while heading to court and cited eyewitness reports that law enforcement personnel used undue force and provided no grounds at the time of arrest, “raising serious concerns about their safety”.
“Amnesty International is alarmed by the manner of the arrest, lack of adherence to due process and by the authorities’ continued pursuit of spurious and retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Imaan and Hadi for their human rights work and dissent,” the post read.
“This familiar playbook of harassment and intimidation must end. Amnesty International calls on the Pakistani authorities to immediately release Imaan Mazari‑Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha and drop all charges targeting them solely for their work defending human rights.”







Former PTI federal minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, despite disagreeing with Imaan’s views, also criticised the arrest.
“While I find Imaan Mazari’s views on Balochistan to be foolishly misdirected, no individual should face state repression for their opinions,” he said.
Hussain said that the lawyers’ repeated arrests highlighted “the growing irrelevance of professional legal bodies” and called on lawyers “to reclaim their agency and restore the ‘red line’ around their freedom and dignity”.







PTI leader Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra took to X and wrote that neither Imaan nor Hadi “have ever been a threat to the state, certainly not in being a voice for the voiceless”.
“The continuous overreach of a regime that knows it is unpopular and illegitimate, and has decided to clamp down on the truth as a result, by any manner possible, is something that is eroding the strength of the state and the public’s trust,” he wrote.
He suggested that they “would be wiser to create a Pakistani board of peace to sort matters within”.
“Fear, repression and coercion are no substitute for legitimate rule,” Jhagra wrote. “Ultimately, we are only increasing the price [that] the entire country will need to pay.”







Former senator Afrasiab Khattak called the arrest “a brazen attack by the usurpers on human rights and rule of law”.
“But fascist tactics can’t save the usurpers from wrath of the people who will definitely make them accountable,” he added.







Similarly, former senator Mushahid Hussain Syed also expressed his outrage over the arrest, branding it “a travesty of law and all norms of justice”.
“[The] rule of law must prevail and both should be released forthwith!” he wrote in a post on X.







Meanwhile, former member of parliament Bushra Gohar also condemned the incident, saying, “Speaking up for human rights and standing against oppression isn’t a crime.”







Barrister Khadija Siddiqi said on social media that the Islamabad police had allegedly manhandled the lawyers and “forcibly dragged them to arrest them”, while phones recording the arrest had been seized by the police.
Siddiqui called it an “abhorrent state of affairs, an absolute shame and disgrace for the Islamabad Bar president”.
“No condemnation can be enough!” she said.







Dawn’s foreign affairs and national security correspondent Baqir Sajjad, said, “Under international human rights conventions, every person deserves a fair trial and due process.
“Denying this and state overreach in under-trial cases expose weakness, not strength. Those facing court must always be given a real chance to defend themselves. Justice demands no less.”
He added that judicial compromises and breakdowns did not serve anyone, but rather eroded judicial independence, trust and the rule of law.
“Principles aren’t optional,” Sajjad added.







Journalist Arifa Noor called on the government to condemn the incident, calling it “absolutely pathetic”.
“Will the government and its allies condemn this and make some effort, any effort, to get Imaan and Hadi released?” she said, reposting footage of the arrest posted by Maryam Nawaz Khan.







Journalist Mariana Baabar said that the judiciary was trampling its own laws by not producing first information reports (FIRs), saying that Hadi and Imaan were “prepared. Unafraid.”







Meanwhile, journalist Asma Sherazi said, “This shows the weakness of (the) government, not Imaan and Hadi. Release them and don’t make mockery of justice.”







Journalist Ahmad Noorani also called the incident “highly condemnable”.







Journalist Hamid Mir said that the arrest of Imaan and Hadi “will make this couple more powerful and more respectable”.







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan “strongly condemned” the action, demanding the “immediate disclosure of their whereabouts”.







Aurat March Islamabad called upon “all members of civil society, students, lawyers, and every conscious citizen to join us in resistance” against the arrest. “We must stand together against this blatant attempt to silence the voices of dissent and legal advocacy,” the group wrote on X.







Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah, in a statement, also condemned the arrest, saying, “Over the past months, this peculiar case has been distorted and convoluted beyond recognition. ‎It has clearly turned into a witch hunt and an ulterior-motivated vendetta”.
“‎It is time to commend and appreciate all the legions of human rights defenders (HRDs), activists, lawyers and media-persons across Pakistan and globally, as well as political workers, who are standing up to be counted unconditionally, unequivocally in solidarity with Imaan and Hadi,” she stated.‎</p><small>2026-01-23 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23172351056c4b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968624/central-bank-seen-cutting-rates-again-after-december-surprise' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank seen cutting rates again after December surprise</strong></a><br><p>The central bank is expected to cut its key policy rate by 50 basis points at its upcoming meeting, a Reuters poll showed, as easing inflation, improving foreign exchange buffers and a stabilising rupee bolster the case for further monetary easing despite lingering risks.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet on Jan 26 (Monday).
Of the 10 analysts surveyed, seven expect the SBP to cut rates by 50 basis points, two see a deeper 75 basis point reduction, while one expects the central bank to hold rates unchanged, following a surprise cut in December that ended a four-meeting pause.
The median forecast points to a 50 bps cut.
That would cement a change in direction from the SBP’s aggressive tightening cycle after rates peaked at a record 22 per cent in 2023, with cumulative cuts since mid-2024 totalling 1,150 bps so far.
Analysts projecting a 50 bps move cited moderating inflation, higher foreign exchange reserves and a better balance of payments outlook, while flagging the need for caution given persistent core inflation and geopolitical risks.
The inflation outlook has eased marginally and external buffers have strengthened, giving the SBP room to support growth, said Waqas Ghani, Head of equity research at JS Global Capital , adding that expectations remain anchored despite elevated non-food inflation.
Those expecting a larger cut argue that macroeconomic conditions are now aligned for more decisive easing.
Pakistan appears on the verge of returning to a single-digit policy rate, said Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, pointing to improving growth momentum, stable reserves and inflation running below the central banks medium-term target.
A 50 basis point cut would bring Pakistan’s policy rate to 10.5 per cent.
The cautious camp, however, warned that risks remain.
Fawad Basir, head of research at KTrade, cited geopolitical uncertainty and its impact on fuel prices as a reason for a measured pace of easing, while AKD Securities expects the central bank to hold rates until July.
The survey follows data showing inflation slowed to 5.6pc year-on-year in December, with prices falling on a monthly basis due to lower perishable food costs, though non-food inflation remains elevated.
The SBP has said inflation stayed within its 5-7pc target range during July-November but warned core inflation remains sticky and headline inflation could rise temporarily toward the end of the fiscal year due to base effects.
The International Monetary Fund, in a report, has cautioned against premature monetary easing under Pakistan’s $7 billion loan programme.</p><small>2026-01-23 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23155126893fcf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968603/diplomatic-win-in-joint-session-govt-again-defends-decision-to-join-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>‘Diplomatic win’: In joint session, govt again defends decision to join Trump-led Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday again defended its decision to join the Board of Peace led by US President Donald Trump, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the leaders and senior officials of 19 countries, including Pakistan, who gathered in Davos on Thursday and put their names to the founding charter of the Board of Peace — a move that has been denounced by the opposition.
Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the onslaught in Gaza. It was originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year onslaught on the Palestinian enclave, but the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Thursday had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people.
The matter was again debated in a joint session of Parliament on Friday, summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and presided over by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
Arguing in defence of the government’s decision to join the board during the session, Iqbal said this “diplomatic win” should be celebrated.
He began his speech by recalling nuclear tests by Pakistan in 1998. “We set an example of Pakistan’s liberty and sovereignty when the then-US president called five times […] Pakistan was being pressurised from the world, but we took the decision [to conduct the tests] with courage,” he said.
Amid a noisy protest from the opposition benches, he asserted, “We don’t need to be taught about Pakistan’s defence and integrity. We are the defenders of Pakistan’s freedom and sovereignty.”
He went on to emphatically state that with the PML-N in power, “there can be no danger to Pakistan’s integrity and sovereignty.”
Iqbal said the government and armed forces had proved during a four-day conflict with India in May that anyone intending to harm the country would get a befitting reply. “So nobody can taunt that we are cowards and negligent.”
The minister said it was very easy to deliver speeches on Palestine in the House, adding that “our hearts have been wounded by the cruelty” that had been witnessed in the Palestinian enclave.
“But Muslim countries took a collective initiative to end that bloodshed,” he continued, further stating that the opposition was refusing to accept the “peace that the people of Palestine have celebrated”.
He went on to say that had the government decided not to join the Board of Peace, opposition members would have been decrying that Pakistan had been not been given any importance, that it had been isolated. They would have questioned why Pakistan was not a part of that big an initiavtive of peace, Iqbal said.
Listing other Muslim countries that joined the Board of Peace, Iqbal asked were they not Muslim countries and brother countries of Pakistan. “Have they joined [the Board of Peace] to contribute to the bloodshed of Muslims?”
The minister said prominent Muslim countries were given a chance through this initiative to play their role for the rights of the people of Palestine and for peace in Palestine.
He stressed that the government’s stance was the same as that of the people of Pakistan: “that Israel was an aggressor and a cruel country, which — Netanyahu has the blood of Muslims and Palestinians on his hands.”
“Our moral stance has not changed at all,” he said, adding that the government decided to join the board on the basis of this stance. “So that we can play our role along with our brother countries for peace in Palestine.”
He said that a major reason behind “the halt to bombardment” in Palestine was the role of eight Muslim countries that worked with the Trump administration on a ceasefire plan for Gaza.
“And the people [of Palestine] accepted that ceasefire, and they appreciated that the ensuing peace gave them an opportunity to begin their lives anew,” he maintained.
The minister added: “Our stance regarding Palestine is unchanged. We still believe that the state of Palestine is the right of the people of Palestine. Pakistan supported this in the past and, it supports it today as well.”
Speaking before Iqbal, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas took exception to the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace without taking Parliament into confidence.
“The board will further add to the miseries of the people of Palestine. What Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu could not do will begin in the name of Board of Peace,” he decried.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also voiced opposition to the decision, claiming it was taken because of the “fear of Trump”.
He accused the US president of strengthening Israel against Muslim countries such as Iran.
Earlier, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence.
In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.”







“The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read.
It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”
Joint session passes 3 bills
The joint session also saw the passage of three bills — the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 — amid protest by the opposition.
During the session, opposition members, led by opposition leaders in the Senate and NA — Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — gathered near the speaker’s dias and protested against the bills.
President Zardari had returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA. With regards to the Daanish Schools Authority Bill, a statement by the Presidency had quoted Zardari as saying: “In the case of the establishment of Daanish schools in the provinces, prior consultation with the respective provincial governments is essential.”
A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting.
The PML-N leader said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had met a PPP delegation, comprising Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, and Farooq H. Naek, to assure the ruling partner that the proposed legislation would not impact the 18th Amendment, which had devolved education to provinces.
When the Daanish Schools Authority Bill was presented in the joint sitting, the JUI-F objected to it.
JUI-F Senator Murtaza contended that President Zardari had returned the bill unsigned and had termed it contrary to the Constitution.
The bill, however, was passed.
The Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025 was presented by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chaudhry while PPP MNA Shazia Marri also proposed an amendment in the legislation, both of which were approved.
The JUI-F also recommended some amendments to the bill, which were rejected.
PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui presented the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, which was passed amid protest by opposition members.
JUI-F chief Rehman termed the legislation “unconstitutional and unlawful”, calling for it to be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. He said the bill was contrary to Islam.
In the legislation’s defence, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry contended that the bill would provide protection to not just women but men as well.
Gul Plaza inferno
In the joint sitting, members of both Houses of Parliament passed a resolution expressing solidarity with the victims of Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno, calling on the Sindh government to introduce “systemic reforms” ensuring that the tragedy is not repeated.
The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms.
“The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read.
It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali, who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire.
In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.”
“Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well.
It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.”
The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”.
It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.”
Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi.
“Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”.
During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population.
Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”.
She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”.
Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest
Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”.
The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts.
Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”.
“Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”.
Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.</p><small>2026-01-23 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231553542ca09ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968618/scotland-yard-probes-attacks-against-two-pakistani-dissidents-living-in-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Scotland Yard probes attacks against two Pakistani dissidents living in UK</strong></a><br><p>British counter-terrorism police are investigating a series of what authorities have described as “highly targeted” attacks against two Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, according to a report published by The Guardian on Friday.
Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command took over the investigation following four attacks that began on Christmas Eve in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire. One person has been arrested, and one of the incidents involved the use of a firearm.
The attacks targeted two prominent supporters of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. One of the victims told The Guardian that his attackers appeared to be “fair-skinned, white or wearing masks” and said he feared for his life.
The first two attacks took place on Christmas Eve. In Chesham, Buckinghamshire, two men broke into the home of a dissident shortly after 8am and vandalised the property.
The second attack occurred at the Cambridgeshire home of rights lawyer Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a human rights lawyer and former member of Imran’s cabinet.
Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, was recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court. He also faces extradition efforts. In December, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.
Akbar, 48, told the newspaper he was attacked just after 8am when he opened his front door.
“A masked man started punching me, after asking, ‘are you Shahzad Akbar?’ I must have got 25-30 punches on my face,” he said. He added that the attacker appeared “trained”, with “proper footwork like a boxer, going only for my face”.
“My children and wife … were terrorised and screaming,” Akbar said, adding that he managed to push the attacker out of the house.
Following the incident, counter-terrorism officers assumed control of the investigation.
On police advice, Akbar and his family moved out of their home and went into hiding. He said that on December 31, he briefly returned to the property, and minutes after he left, a second attack took place.
“Six minutes after my departure, two men were seen on the CCTV, faces covered,” Akbar said. “One man with a firearm shot straight into the front window; three shots were fired and the window was pierced through.”
He said another attacker attempted to start a fire by throwing a burning rag through the window, but neighbours came outside, prompting the attackers to flee.
A third attack occurred on January 10. Akbar said one man “sprayed some chemicals on the outer wall and then broke windows with an iron bar” before fleeing after alarms were triggered. Police said racist graffiti was also sprayed on the exterior of the house.
Akbar said he believed he was targeted because of his political views. “I am a Pakistani dissident living in exile here,” he told The Guardian. “I am an open critic of the Pakistani regime.”
“I cannot say who did it. However, one thing is certain: it was a targeted attack and the people who attacked were probably hired by someone,” he said.
Akbar also said he had been the victim of an unsolved acid attack at his home in 2023.
“I fear for my life and for my family’s lives,” he said.
According to The Guardian, counter-terrorism officials have warned of an increase in attacks in the UK carried out by criminal proxies acting on behalf of states such as Russia, Iran and China against critics of their regimes.
Britain’s Foreign Office has been criticised for failing to speak publicly about the attacks.</p><small>2026-01-23 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22110310503baf2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968042/the-interminable-wait-between-life-and-death-at-gul-plaza-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>The interminable wait between life and death at Gul Plaza in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>It wasn’t so much about the announcement or the declaration of death, muttered Qaiser, but the hours, minutes and seconds between the knowing and the not knowing — the brief yet interminable time of feeling suspended. On Tuesday, the elderly, bespectacled man entered his fourth day of waiting outside what used to be Gul Plaza.
Patches of dust, soot and perspiration stained his white shalwar kameez. His eyes drifted everywhere all at once, always searching but never landing anywhere. Every time a reporter approached him for an interview, he traded it for information: “Here is my phone number, please share the list of the dead whenever you get it,” he requested, and then proceeded to narrate his story.
“My begum loved to shop, and she found the perfect partners in my daughter and bahu,” Qaiser recalled. On Saturday evening, the three women ventured to Gul Plaza — a paradise for shopaholics in Karachi — with a strict 10pm curfew. It was broken, and since then, Qaiser had remained encamped in front of the shopping centre.
As of Wednesday, dozens of people who were trapped inside the plaza when the fire erupted were still missing. So far, 71 bodies or their remains had been recovered.


Fire trucks continue cooling work at Karachi’s Gul Plaza.

Outside Gul Plaza — now just an empty shell — fire trucks and water tankers stood close by, sporadically spraying water to cool the thick smoke emanating from the building. At a short distance, Edhi and Chhipa ambulances lined the road, the drivers inside them taking turns to rest their backs. Near the rear end of the mall, which had since caved in, dumper trucks made hourly rounds to clear carcasses and debris.
On the main road facing the plaza, a crowd of spectators had converged on the footpath, watching intently; dozens of others stood on the rooftops of nearby buildings to get a better view. Camps had also been set up nearby, and the volunteers seated there were quick to distribute water bottles to firefighters, policemen and rescue officials.
Movement never eluded Gul Plaza — not in life, nor in death. But even as rescue work continued, the air hung heavy with the weight of the wait, suspended in anticipation like a defendant about to hear the verdict.
Waiting for help to arrive
For Muhammad Shujat, who worked at an electronics shop at the plaza, patience was running thin on the fourth day. “It is better to die once than to die 100 times each waiting minute,” his shrill cry echoed through the morning breeze. “It is agony.”
Like Qaiser, he hadn’t been home since late Saturday night. He recalled leaving his shop “fully intact” at 9:30pm — the shutters were locked and the day’s earnings secured. “Around 10:45pm, I started getting calls that a fire had erupted at Gul Plaza.”
The 40-year-old reached the plaza within 15 minutes from his residence in Orangi Town, otherwise a 45-minute drive, where he was welcomed by chaos, screams and tears — all of which had been playing inside his brain on loop.
“I tried to get into my shop, which faces the main road, and frantically tried to secure the merchandise, but the flames were huge, unforgiving. All I could do instead was watch my livelihood burn before me and wait … wait for fire tenders, for divine intervention, for a miracle.”


Rescue teams clear debris of Gul Plaza building that collapsed after a blaze ripped through it.

Help did come, but a little too late. The first tenders arrived at the site nearly two hours after the fire broke out, Shujat recalled, and within five minutes they ran out of water. “Once again, we were told to wait, this time for water tankers that were coming from Sohrab Goth and Nipa Chowrangi.”
But by the time they arrived, Shujat’s shop — which, according to him, held items worth Rs3 billion — was reduced to ashes. There was nothing left to save.
“Theek hai [that’s fine],” he said. “They were merely objects, merely money, merely materials that can be built again … but what about the people? Faisal sahab, the neighbour; Asif sahab, the friend; Usman and Kamran, the porters — who will bring them back?”
Shujat’s remarks were not rhetorical; they were very much a question. He was waiting for them, even if dead, and he was ready to risk his life to get them out. “I am tired of waiting. I am ready to jump inside if I have to. I need them back.”
As he spoke, Shujat’s voice pitched higher, loud enough to attract the attention of policemen and Rangers personnel on duty. They began closing in on him to prevent any potential commotion, but before that could happen, Qaiser jumped in.
“Bhai, even I am frustrated … but we must wait,” he coaxed the fellow griever and then proceeded to embrace Shujat, who broke down instantly. Both found a spot at the footpath and sat together, waiting.
Waiting for empathy
A few steps from them, two men in yellow jackets inscribed with ‘Khidmat-i-Khalq Foundation’ walked back to a fire truck owned by the welfare organisation.
“It is hell inside … 100 degrees Celsius,” one of them announced.
“The building will fall … the walls are cracking, they are withering … sab kuch jal k raakh hogaya hai,” said the other.
Among them was Muhammad Khizer Khan, the head of the foundation’s Karachi division and one of the first to arrive at Gul Plaza that night. “On reaching the site, we got our fire trucks working,” he recounted to Dawn.
But what fight could two vehicles put up against a monster breathing flames?


One of the many help desks set up by welfare groups outside Gul Plaza.

According to his team’s findings, the fire broke out in the air conditioning unit and then spread toward the artificial flower shops on the mezzanine floor. “After waiting for two hours, when the KMC (Karachi Metropolitan Corporation) fire trucks finally arrived, they did not have snorkels, so the blaze on the top floors was not catered to.”
During every minute spent waiting, the fire gained strength, intensity, and control — eventually, it became a third-degree blaze. “Every time, we wait for the government to come up with a better response, every time we wait for them to act promptly, every time we fall for the empty promises they make to us.”
Suddenly, an announcement was made. A body was found, but it was unidentifiable — just bones. The engine of one of the Chhipa ambulances revved; the vehicle bounced over the road dug up for the rapid bus transit construction, off to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital. Several people, including Qaiser and Shujat, gathered, shooting questions, but they were all told to head to the medical facility and get DNA tests done. Chaos ensued.
Ehsan Waleed, whose cousin was missing, was among those searching. “We keep running here and there … when we go up to them, they tell us to wait; when we ask questions, they tell us to calm down. What do we do?” he asked.
“From the first day, we have been telling rescue officials to set up an information desk here (there is one at the district commissioner’s office) to facilitate and guide the families.
“They said they will. We are all still waiting.”
When the men in uniforms wait
For his part, Javed Irshad, deputy director of the KMC Fire Brigade, told Dawn that the department received a call regarding the Gul Plaza inferno a little after 10:30pm. In seven minutes, three fire trucks, each accompanied by a nine-member crew, were deployed.
“Our response time for any such incident is three minutes, which means that during this time span, the fire trucks and crew must be out of the station,” he explained. “But we cannot tell when it reaches the site because there are multiple factors at play, such as traffic jams, the condition of the roads …
“All of Karachi is dug up,” Irshad scoffed. The road opposite Gul Plaza was no different.
On reaching the site, an examination was conducted to check the connection points for water lines, turn off the electricity, and inspect the building. “But by that time, the fire had intensified to unprecedented levels; in my 36 years of experience, never have I seen this.”

 

He admitted that the fire trucks ran out of water, which then had to be summoned from the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation-run hydrants, all located at a considerable distance from the site. “These are all operational challenges that we don’t have any control over; this doesn’t raise questions about our firefighters, their valour or bravery.”
“And they demonstrated this when they stepped inside the building despite extreme heat, when they remained calm even after being mistreated, and when our firefighter lost his life during the rescue operation,” Irshad added.


What remains of Gul Plaza after Saturday’s fire.

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan narrated similar challenges during the operation: broken roads and traffic jams delayed the emergency response. “And when we reached the plaza, the entire area was jammed packed due to the weekend … to top it, a mob-like situation emerged.”
When the fire trucks ran out of water, it wasn’t just the people who were waiting, but Haseeb and his team did too. “As the intensity of the fire increased, we knew how difficult it would be to control it … but we could do nothing about the traffic or the broken roads or the narrow lanes or the people who just wanted to save their shops.”
Waiting for resources
At the same time, Irshad acknowledged the need for a bigger staff and better resources for the fire department.
According to international fire safety protocols, there must be one fire station for a population of 100,000. In Karachi — home to over 20 million as per the 2023 census — a meagre 28 fire stations are functional, which isn’t sufficient to meet even 10 per cent of the metropolis’ needs.
Ideally, every locality in the city should have a fire station with two fire trucks on service. During a Sindh Assembly session last month, it was revealed that Karachi only has 36 fire tenders, four snorkels and roughly 700 staff, when it actually needs about 200 stations and 34,000 staff.

The Sindh government tried to purchase 89 fire tenders in 2021, with 17 originally allocated to Karachi. The order was reduced to 35 vehicles, and Karachi’s share was cut and redistributed across the province to Hyderabad (10), Sukkur (7), Benazirabad (5), Mirpurkhas (5), and Larkana (8). None of them, however, has been delivered.
During the Gul Plaza inferno, the absence of this equipment manifested in the worst way possible. Haseeb of Rescue 1122 mentioned how lighting was a key issue as his men worked in near-total darkness, trying to navigate through narrow stairwells.
“We are sifting through every particle of dust and ash here … we are looking for not just a human body but body parts,” he said.
Meanwhile, Syed Mairaj Mohsin, a Chhipa worker who had been on duty outside the shopping centre since Saturday, pointed out how window grills prevented people from escaping. “We have seen these visuals at the Baldia factory fire and the RJ Mall inferno.”
In the current scenario, Karachi needed all of the city’s fire tenders to deal with a third-degree fire, such as the one at Gul Plaza, which was exactly what happened. If the city were to face another such blaze, it would need Rs5 billion to equip the fire department, showed a batch of official documents available with Dawn.
What we are talking about here is basic equipment: adequate water supply, wireless communication tools, lighting, the right vehicles, fire suits for each man that usually cost $2,500 or Rs700,000, breathing apparatus, protective masks, helmets, hydraulic cutters and spreaders, and smoke ejectors. In their absence, it was not possible to safely enter burning structures or remain inside long enough to rescue people.
Irshad was hopeful, though. He called the Karachi Fire Department Mayor Murtaza Wahab’s ‘favourite’. “He has promised to fill 440 vacancies for firemen and drivers within two months. At the same time, promotions in the department, halted for a long time, are also on the cards,” he was confident.
Waiting for prevention
Meanwhile, for Sufyan Sheikh, secretary general of the Fire Protection Association of Pakistan, the tragedy at Gul Plaza cannot be fully understood through the lens of a delayed response.
“Globally, the fire brigade is considered the last line of defence,” he explained. “Before that, the responsibility lies squarely with building owners.”
A fire tender, Sheikh said, could carry roughly 3,000 gallons of water — enough to douse flames for just two to two-and-a-half minutes — provided the water was released at a pressure of 500 gallons per minute at eight bar. “It is not technically possible for a fire truck to carry more than that,” he added.
“Ideally, every locality should have its own fire station,” Sheikh said. “For sustained firefighting, you need at least 60,000 gallons of water for two hours. With these resources, how do you give coverage to the entire city?”


Fire trucks spray water on the Gul Plaza building.

The Gul Plaza inferno, he pointed out, was one of the few incidents where almost all available firefighting machinery in Karachi was deployed — and even then, it took three days to extinguish the blaze. “What if two such fires break out at the same time?” he asked. “What will you do then?”
Sheikh believed the greater failure lies not in response, but in prevention.
International standards require building owners to take extensive fire safety measures, including the installation of functional extinguishers, clearly marked and accessible emergency exits, fire alarms, proper housekeeping of combustible materials, and adherence to occupancy limits. “If these measures are in place, the intensity of a fire can be reduced by up to 95pc,” he said.
Those who were unable to escape Gul Plaza, he added, were largely people who stayed behind to protect their shops, only to be eventually trapped. “A third-degree fire produces temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. You cannot expect firefighters to go inside such conditions,” Sheikh said. “It is simply not possible.”
What was needed now, he stressed, were structural reforms: stricter enforcement of building safety codes, the hiring of competent inspection teams, and sustained public education on fire risks. “The government can fix this,” he said. “The real question is whether it wants to.”
Until then, the waiting continues — outside Gul Plaza, where men like Qaiser and Shujat remain on the footpath, watching ambulances come and go, listening for announcements that may finally bring certainty.
In Karachi, waiting has become part of the disaster itself: waiting for water, for help, for answers, for reforms. And in that waiting, lives are lost not all at once, but with each passing minute.

The duo were left out of the squad for the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka earlier this month, where all-rounder Shadab Khan made his comeback.
He will form part of a strong spin-bowling contingent along with Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and Usman Tariq, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement today.







The matches will take place at Lahore’s Gadaffi Stadium on January 29, 31 and February 1 and will begin at 4pm PKT.
Pakistan squad and player support personnel are expected to convene in Lahore on Jan 24 and will begin their preparations for the series the following day, PCB said today.
Meanwhile, Australia is set to arrive in Pakistan on January 28 and will play just their second series in the format on Pakistani soil after a solitary T20I in April 2022, also at Gaddafi Stadium.
A day earlier, Babar announced that he would miss the remainder of the Big Bash League in Australia since he had been recalled to Pakistan for a national team camp ahead of the T20I series.
Australia announced their 17-player squad earlier this week and have rested five top players, including Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Josh Hazlewood, Tim David and Nathan Ellis.
16-member Pakistan squad:
Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wk), Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wk) and Usman Tariq

This, in essence, captures the experience of the traditional joint family system in South Asia.
Legend has it that the joint family system in South Asia has roots in ancient and medieval agrarian societies, where extended families living together made economic and social sense.
Nowadays, the traditional joint family, though increasingly rare, is part of our cultural legacy — something many families take pride in. It represents a tradition where multiple generations live together in the same household, where grandparents, uncles, aunts, or cousins continue living together under one roof, a practice not commonly seen in the Western part of the world.
A nuclear family, on the other hand, usually consists of just two parents and their children, living together. As someone from a nuclear family, I have the first-hand experience of cherishing the nights with my cousins during occasional visits. As they say, absence teaches you its value.
The warmth of a family, being surrounded by so many people who love and care about you, can make you feel that you are important in so many people’s lives. However, as reflected by different perspectives, this closeness often comes at a cost.
Sadiqul Haque, a final-year engineering student, finds his skills at conflict resolution inadequate when he visits his extended family in his hometown. 
“In a joint family, you have to be extra cautious about what you say to any person. One wrong word, and chances are at least someone can feel offended,” remarked Haque.
As someone who occasionally visits a joint family, I feel this pressure too. You don’t always have the social energy or the time to visit all the uncles and eat at every one of their places. One has to be extra careful not to inadvertently hurt anyone’s sentiment, which can be tiring for anyone, especially if they have to endure this hypervigilance round the clock.
Haque also shared that concentrating on studies during exam nights can be challenging in a joint family. “I can ask my mum and dad to keep the volume down, but I cannot say the same to my uncle or aunt, for fear of offending someone,” he lamented. 
Many argue that joint families can silently take away your freedom. In retrospect, Haque stated that the thing he cherishes most about living in a nuclear family with just his parents is the freedom he enjoys.
However, a joint family is not all about invisible constraints. Many argue that in a joint family, there is always someone for you if you need help.
Safkat Zahir, a final year undergrad student who is currently living with his nuclear family, pointed out that children need to share their emotions with trusted persons. “A nuclear family is okay, but if the children do not get to speak with their parents or they do not get enough interactions, they run the risk of being isolated, which can have a long-term effect on the child’s mental health and behaviour,” he asserted.

In a nuclear family, children may feel isolated if their parents do not spend enough time with them or create a safe space for them to open up. In that case, a joint family can come to the rescue, as there usually is someone the child can trust, maybe a grandparent, a favourite aunt, or a cousin. 

When one member of the family falls sick, another takes care of them and handles the important household responsibilities for that interim period. It is this built-in support system that makes joint families resilient during tough times.
Amina Rahman, a first-year university student living away from her family, highlighted that the joint family experience can be fun during festivals like Eid and New Year’s.
“Staying by yourselves in a nuclear family during these festive times can be very depressing. You need your extended family to enjoy these festivals,” she expressed.
For those who have lived in joint families once and moved to become nuclear ones, the memories stay forever.
Fardin Taharim, a first-year university student living away from his family, finds himself reminiscing about his best childhood memories with his cousins. Born in a joint family, Taharim was around five years old when his family moved out to become nuclear. 
Referring to the sense of belonging he found in a joint family, Taharim reflected, “I don’t have a big friend circle. My world revolves around only a few people. My extended family members are among them. I love spending time with my cousins. I have sweet uncles and aunts. Family nights are the best.”
Janifar Kamal, an international student currently pursuing her master’s in the US, grew up in a joint family for 14 years of her life. Reflecting on her experience, she emphasised, “Living in a brown family can make you used to being surrounded by chaos.”
A nuclear family can be peaceful and offer more freedom, but a joint family, despite the chaos, comes with connection and belonging that is hard to find elsewhere.

According to a press release by the CM’s office, the initiative aims to ease traffic congestion, improve public safety, and boost economic activity in the provincial capital.
The meeting, held at CM House, was attended by Local Government Minister Nasir Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, Secretary to the CM Raheem Shaikh, and other relevant officers.
Nasir informed the chief minister that 24 TMCs across Karachi had requested funding to repair severely dilapidated roads and streets. Due to financial constraints, these TMCs were unable to carry out the works independently.
Wahab reported that 409 roads across seven districts of Karachi needed rehabilitation, including 400 requiring patch repairs and nine requiring complete reconstruction.







According to a breakdown presented by Nasir, a total of 409 roads across Karachi’s seven districts have been identified for rehabilitation at an estimated cost of Rs10.93bn.
Of these, 400 roads would undergo patchwork repairs, while nine roads would be reconstructed to address severe structural damage. An additional 15 per cent allocation of Rs1.64bn was needed for sewerage and water supply projects, bringing the total project cost for this component to Rs12.57bn, the mayor stated.
Citing district-wise estimates, the press release said Malir District had the highest number of roads identified for repair (98), followed by West (81), Central (53), South (50), East (49), Korangi (39) and Keamari (39).
The highest tentative cost was estimated for Keamari District at Rs2.32bn, followed by West at Rs2.31bn and East at Rs1.85bn.
The meeting was informed that 24 TMCs will implement internal road rehabilitation schemes within their respective jurisdictions.
These include major allocations for TMC Manghopir (Rs1.75bn), TMC Gadap (Rs960 million), TMC Baldia (Rs944m) and TMC Mauripur (Rs858m).
Most TMC schemes involve patchwork repairs, while selected roads in Gulberg, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Sohrab Goth, Orangi, Manghopir, Saddar, and Landhi would undergo end-to-end rehabilitation, the statement noted.
CM Murad recalled his previous instructions issued at a meeting on January 7, where he had directed that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) would rehabilitate 26 major roads.

 

During the meeting, Wahab presented the KMC’s assessment estimates, which put costs at Rs5.53bn for road reconstruction and resurfacing.
Another Rs1bn were estimated for urgent water and sewerage repairs to be managed by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Rs1bn for stormdrain retention wall construction and reinforcement, and Rs1bn for streetlight installation and upgrades.
The total estimated expenditure for KMC-led works was Rs8.53bn, according to the press release.
CM Murad stressed that prompt rehabilitation of Karachi’s roads was essential for economic growth and public convenience. He instructed departments to fast-track approval processes and “ensure transparent and high-quality execution of all projects”.
“Amenities for the public and the safety of citizens remain the top priorities of the Sindh government,” the chief minister was quoted as saying.
He further directed authorities to guarantee “transparency, quality and timely completion of all approved schemes”.
The Sindh CM also directed the Finance Department to release funds immediately so that development work on damaged roads, sewerage systems and streetlights could commence.
Nasir informed the chief minister that the total cost of the TMC mega scheme stands at Rs10.93bn, comprising Rs10.68bn for road patchwork and Rs248m for complete road rehabilitation.
An additional 15pc (Rs1.64bn) was earmarked for sewerage and water supply works, while 5pc (Rs628m) was allocated for Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) charges, and 1pc (Rs125m) for contingency expenses. The overall TMC-related project cost has been estimated at Rs13.32bn.
CM Murad directed all relevant departments and TMCs to ensure coordinated execution of road, sewerage and water supply works to avoid repeated digging and inconvenience to citizens.
He reiterated that transparency, quality control, and timely completion would be strictly monitored.
In a similar initiative taken in November, CM Murad approved a plan presented by Wahab and announced a Rs25bn special package for Karachi after heavy rains caused extensive damage to road infrastructure.</p><small>2026-01-23 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23140709a270b73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968611/7-rescued-4-missing-after-merchant-vessel-hits-fishing-boat-off-karachis-manora' target='_blank'><strong>7 rescued, 4 missing after merchant vessel hits fishing boat off Karachi’s Manora</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Seven people were rescued while a search operation was underway to find four others missing after a merchant vessel hit a fishing boat off Manora Beach on Friday morning.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that seven people had been rescued, with four still missing, in the incident.
In a separate statement, Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre said search efforts were ongoing for the missing individuals.
DIG Raza detailed that the incident took place in a channel of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) at about 2am, when a civil fishing boat named Al-Shahbaz was hit by merchant vessel Kang Huan.
“All fishermen on the boat jumped into the sea, and the fishing boat toppled down,” the police officer added. Subsequently, rescue operations were initiated by HPO, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency and the KPT.
“Seven persons were rescued by another fishing boat,” DIG Raza said, adding that four were still missing.
“The recovered fishermen were taken to the hospital via Edhi ambulance from Keamari Jetty,” the DIG said.

In its statement, the Edhi service had said: “A boat capsized at Manora Beach and multiple people sank, of which six people were recovered alive with the aid of Edhi’s marine aid team.”
A week ago, a boat carrying eight residents of Karachi capsized in the open sea near Keti Bandar. The incident left one person dead and another missing, while six others were rescued by local fishermen.
In September, a fisherman drowned and three survived when their boat capsized near Port Qasim due to strong winds.</p><small>2026-01-23 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231414364377cc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968613/uk-man-faces-court-for-drugging-raping-ex-wife-over-13-years' target='_blank'><strong>UK man faces court for drugging, raping ex-wife over 13 years</strong></a><br><p>A British man is due to appear in court on Friday accused of drugging and raping his ex-wife over 13 years, alongside five other men also charged with sexual offences against her.
Philip Young, 49, is charged with 56 sexual offences against his former wife Joanne Young, 48, including rape and administering a substance with the intent to stupefy or overpower to allow sexual activity.
Joanne Young has waived her legal right to anonymity.
Voyeurism, possession of indecent images of children and possession of extreme images are among the other charges filed against Young, who is reportedly a former Conservative councillor.
He is yet to enter a plea, and was remanded in custody after a hearing in December.
Young is set to be joined by five other men, aged 31 to 61, also accused of various sexual offences against his ex-wife, at Winchester Crown Court, a criminal court in southeast England.
The alleged crimes took place between 2010 and 2023.
Norman Macksoni, 47, pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and possession of extreme images.
Dean Hamilton, 47, pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and sexual assault by penetration, as well as two counts of sexual touching.
The three others have not yet entered pleas.
They include Connor Sanderson-Doyle, 31, charged with sexual assault and sexual touching; Richard Wilkins, 61, charged with rape and sexual touching; and Mohammed Hassan, 37, charged with sexual touching.
The case bears echoes of a totally separate, unrelated 2024 trial in France in which Gisele Pelicot waived her right to anonymity to raise awareness about sexual violence.

 

Wiltshire Police detective superintendent Geoff Smith said in a statement in December that the UK case stemmed from a “complex and extensive investigation”.
“The victim in this case, Joanne, has taken the decision to waive her automatic legal right to anonymity,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-23 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231331249db4d49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968607/public-health-epidemic-pakistan-battles-legions-of-fake-doctors' target='_blank'><strong>‘Public health epidemic’: Pakistan battles legions of fake doctors</strong></a><br><p>Rusted nails hold used infusion tubes on the wall of a clinic run by one among hundreds of thousands of unqualified doctors operating across the country.
Dozens of patients visit the small roadside shop each day in Sindh, where a few chairs are arranged around wooden tables used to lay patients down.
“These patients have faith in me. They believe I can treat them well,” said Abdul Waheed, who opened the facility a few months ago outside Hyderabad city.
During the day, the 48-year-old works at a private hospital in the city.
In the evenings, he comes to the village of Tando Saeed Khan to see patients at his clinic, charging Rs300 per consultation.
“I have spent so much time in this field. I have worked with several doctors. Thanks to God, I have confidence to diagnose a patient and treat the disease,” Waheed told AFP.

There is no signboard, no registration number, and he has no legal authorisation to practise as a doctor.
Waheed, who has a diploma in homeopathy and has completed a four-year nursing course, speaks with confidence.
After examining two young children, he insisted that patients come to him willingly and trust his abilities.
“No one has questioned me yet. If someone comes, I will see what to do,” he said, reflecting the ease with which unqualified individuals practice medicine in the country.
Such unlicensed clinics are often the first, and sometimes the only, point of care for poor communities.
Dangerously reusing equipment
Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, said there are “more than 600,000 fake doctors” operating across the country.
This nationwide figure has been confirmed by the Sindh Healthcare Commission (SHCC), based on estimates from the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council.
Calling the practise a public health epidemic, Shoro said that such practitioners work with doctors, learn a few things there, and then open their own clinics.
“Unqualified doctors don’t know the side effects and exact dosage of medicines. If a disease is not properly diagnosed, it can become dangerous,” Shoro said.
“The instruments they use are not sterilised. They simply wash them with water and continue using them. They reuse syringes, which increases the spread of hepatitis and AIDS.”

As AFP journalists visited Tando Saeed Khan, another unqualified doctor immediately closed his clinic and disappeared.
Outside Waheed’s shop, villager Ali Ahmed said there are multiple such clinics in the area.
“None of them have qualified doctors. People aren’t educated and can’t recognise qualified doctors,” the 31-year-old told AFP.
Lifelong damage
Medical experts say this unchecked practice has a direct impact on Pakistan’s already strained healthcare system, with tertiary care hospitals overwhelmed by patients whose conditions worsen after improper treatment.
Khalid Bukhari, the head of Civil Hospital Karachi, said the facility regularly receives such cases from across the country.
“They misdiagnose and mistreat patients. Our hospital is overloaded. Most of the cases we receive are those ruined by them,” said Bukhari, whose public hospital is one of the largest in the country.
“These people are playing with the lives of poor citizens. If people go to proper doctors and receive precise treatment, they will not need to come to us.”
Regulatory authorities acknowledge their failure to control the problem.

“We have limited resources. This practice cannot be eliminated easily. If we shut down 25 outlets, 25 new ones open the very next day,” said Ahson Qavi Siddiqi, the head of SHCC.
The commission recently sealed a bungalow in Karachi that had been operating as a hospital — complete with intensive care units for children and adults — because it was unregistered.
“The law against it is weak. We file cases, but the accused get bail the next day because it is a bailable offence,” Siddiqi told AFP.
The official also described serious security threats faced by inspection teams.
“These people are influential in their areas. In many cases, our teams are taken hostage. We are fired upon. I don’t have the force to take strong action,” the SHCC head said.
Shoro said the practice also financially destroys families who are left with big hospital bills when something goes wrong.
“Many people die or become disabled, and their families suffer for the rest of their lives.”</p><small>2026-01-23 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231327100637245.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968608/tiktok-establishes-joint-venture-to-end-us-ban-threat' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok establishes joint venture to end US ban threat</strong></a><br><p>TikTok announced on Thursday that it has established a majority American-owned joint venture to operate its US business, allowing the company to avoid a ban over its Chinese ownership.
The video-sharing app is a global digital entertainment powerhouse, but its mass appeal and links to China have raised concerns over privacy and national security.
The TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will serve more than 200 million users and 7.5m businesses while implementing strict safeguards for data protection and content moderation, the company said.
The new structure responds to a law passed under US President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden that forced Chinese-owned ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations or face a ban in its biggest market.

 

Trump welcomed and claimed credit for the deal, but also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving it.
“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday.
“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”
“I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal,” he added.
Cybersecurity audit
ByteDance retains a 19.9 per cent stake in the joint venture — keeping its ownership below the 20pc threshold stipulated by the law.
Three investors — Silver Lake, Oracle and Abu Dhabi-based AI investment fund MGX — each hold 15pc stakes. Oracle’s executive chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Other investors include Dell Family Office, affiliates of Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic.



The joint venture will retain decision-making authority over trust and safety policies and content moderation for US users.
But TikTok’s global entities will manage international product integration and commercial activities including e-commerce and advertising.
Under the arrangement, US user data will be stored in Oracle’s secure cloud environment, with cybersecurity audited by third-party experts and adhering to federal standards, TikTok said.
Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable, a media company focused on the creator economy, said TikTok users would be relieved by the deal but that there were “still big questions about how this will all play out.”

 

“Behind the scenes, TikTok is likely working hard to assure advertisers it will remain business as normal,” she told AFP.
“While the need for users to download a new app seems unlikely, brand partners will want to know that their TikTok strategies won’t be disrupted.”
Ellison in spotlight
The joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board including TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives from investment firms.
TikTok executive Adam Presser was appointed CEO of the new entity, with Will Farrell serving as chief security officer.

 

The 2024 law came as US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, warned that China could use TikTok to mine Americans’ data or exert influence through its algorithm.
But Trump, crediting the app for his appeal with young voters, delayed enforcement through successive executive orders, most recently extending the deadline to January 22.
The deal largely confirms an outline announced to staff by Chew last month.
In September, one-time venture capitalist and Vice President JD Vance said the US entity would be valued at about $14 billion but it would ultimately be up to investors to determine pricing.
That month, Trump said a new venture had been agreed with China and would meet the law’s requirements.
Trump specifically named Ellison, one of the world’s richest men, as a major player in the arrangement.
Ellison has returned to the spotlight through his dealings with Trump, who has brought his old friend into major AI partnerships with OpenAI.</p><small>2026-01-23 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231311039dd1d19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968605/trump-says-us-armada-headed-toward-gulf' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US ‘armada’ headed toward Gulf</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely, even after downplaying the prospect of imminent military action and saying Tehran appeared interested in talks.
Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.
On his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, the president told reporters on Air Force One the United States was sending a “massive fleet” toward Iran “just in case.”
“We’re watching Iran,” he said. “I’d rather not see anything happen but we’re watching them very closely.”
Addressing the WEF on Thursday, Trump said the United States attacked Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear weapon. Iran denies its nuclear programme is aimed at seeking the bomb.
“Can’t let that happen,” Trump said, adding: “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had also warned Washington Thursday that the force had its “finger on the trigger.”
A fortnight of protests starting in late December shook Iran’s leadership under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the movement has petered out in the face of a crackdown, accompanied by an unprecedented internet blackout.
Last week, Trump pulled back from a threat to strike Iran over its deadly crackdown on the protests after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators.
In a standoff marked by seesawing rhetoric, Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the United States would “wipe them off the face of this Earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a speech Thursday, accused the United States and Israel of stoking the protests as a “cowardly revenge… for the defeat in the 12-Day War”.
‘Legitimate targets’
Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations” and learn from “what they learned in the 12-day imposed war, so that they do not face a more painful and regrettable fate”.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,” he was quoted by state television on the IRGC’s national day.
General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, head of Iran’s joint command headquarters, meanwhile, warned that if America attacked, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would be “legitimate targets” for Iranian forces.

A note issued by Khyber House in Peshawar asked Tirah families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather.
It added that the process of evacuation and registration would restart after weather improvement.
Sources in Tirah had earlier informed that law-enforcement agencies made announcements in the valley about speedy evacuation of families as the Jan 25 deadline for displacement neared.

Stranded families complain they had sleepless nights on the road

Announcements caused panic and worry among Tirah families as the weather turned hostile and LEAs wanted them to leave without delay.
Gul Mand Khan, who reached Bara on Wednesday evening, told Dawn that it took him and his extended family six days to cover 110 kilometres from Bagh Markaz to Bara.
He alleged that the convoy of four vehicles his family travelled in was subjected to prolonged and unnecessary delays at Dwa Thoye, Sandana, Paindi Cheena and later at Mandai Kas in Bara, so they had sleepless nights.
“Though my family was provided with four tokens for transport fare at the Bagh Markaz in Tirah by Bara tehsildar Daud Khan on departure from the valley on Jan 16, it took us three days to cover a mere distance of 15 kilometres up to Dwa Thoye where they’re denied transport fare on the pretext that the said amount would be paid to them in Paindi Cheena registration centre,” he insisted.
The displaced person said that on arrival in Pandi Cheena after a 24-hour journey, the family was informed that payment would be disbursed at the Mandai Kas centre in Bara.
“At Mandai Kas, we’re told to offload luggage from vehicles and take the elderly family members along with women and children to their second homes in Bara and return to collect transport fare the next day,” he said.
Mr Khanadded that he was paid fare for just one vehicle, with the rest of the promised amount being withheld on the pretext of verification from the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders despite the issuance of stamped tokens by the district administration in Tirah.
Turab Ali, a social worker from the Sipah tribe, told Dawn from the Sandana centre over phone that heavy snowfall has blocked all roads, with the registration process being completely halted and hundreds of families stranded on the road.
He said most families had got stuck near the Dwa Thoye centre, facing acute shortage of food and warm clothing.
“It is now becoming a human tragedy as the stranded families are without food while they are forced to stay in their vehicles in extreme cold weather without having adequate facilities,” he said.
Two children reportedly lost lives and three people suffered injuries as three vehicles carrying them skidded off the road due to slippery conditions on the way from Tirah to Bara.
Turab Ali feared more casualties if the vehicles stranded at Dwa Thoye and other areas were not immediately cleared. He said displaced families were fast losing hope of receiving any immediate relief from authorities.
Qari Said Faqir, a Malakdinkhel resident in Tirah, accused the district administration of being involved in the sale of fake tokens for transport fare.
He claimed that Bara tehsildar stationed at Bagh Maidan Markaz was responsible for issuing tokens but he didn’t have any records of the tokens issued as they’re sold to unauthorised people in Paindi Cheena and Mandai Kas centres.
The resident alleged that neither the district administration nor the two parliamentarians from Bara didn’t ensure smooth evacuation of thousands of families from Tirah.

Trump’s about-face follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.
“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at Carney.







Neither Carney’s office nor the White House immediately responded to Reuters’ requests for comment on Thursday evening.
Last week, Carney’s office said he had been invited to serve on the board and planned to accept.
Carney received a rare standing ovation in Davos after the speech, in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.
Canada, which recently signed a trade deal with China, can show how “middle powers” might act together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony, he added.
Trump retorted that Canada “lives because of the United States”, and told listeners in Davos that Carney should be grateful for the United States previous largesse.
“Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,” he added, addressing Carney directly.
The withdrawal of Canada’s invitation came hours after Trump officially launched the board, which was initially meant to cement a Gaza ceasefire.
Permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1 billion each, according to Trump.
“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do,” Trump said in Switzerland on Thursday. “And we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and UN spokesperson Rolando Gomez said on Thursday that UN engagement with the board would only be in that context.
Member nations include Argentina, Bahrain, Morocco, Pakistan and Turkiye. Other US allies, such as Britain, France and Italy, have indicated they will not join for now.</p><small>2026-01-23 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2310074857b388e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968460/islamabad-police-seek-army-support-to-train-newly-formed-swat-force' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police seek army support to train newly formed SWAT force</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The capital police have sought the services of two army majors and 16 Special Services Group (SSG) commandos to train personnel of the newly formed Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) force, Dawn has learnt.
In this regard, a written request was sent from the office of the inspector general of police (IGP), Islamabad, to the office of the chief commissioner, Islamabad. 
The letter, signed by the deputy inspector general of police (Headquarters), sought the requisition of the services of two majors and 16 serving SSG-trained officials on a secondment basis for the capital police.
The letter stated that the Islamabad police are performing multifaceted duties, including maintenance of law and order, crime fighting and prevention and ensuring security and route duties.

Request sent for services of two majors and 16 SSG commandos on secondment

It further requested that the concerned quarters be approached to place the services of two majors and 16 serving SSG-trained officials of the Pakistan Army at the disposal of the capital police against existing vacant posts. Out of the 16 SSG-trained personnel, 10 will be attached to the National Police Academy (NPA), Islamabad.
The letter added that the matter may be accorded top priority.
A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the chief commissioner’s office forwarded the request to the Interior Ministry, from where it was being sent to the concerned army authorities.
The officer said the SWAT force had been established in the capital police with a manpower of over 200 personnel and was most likely to operate under the command and supervision of the senior superintendent of police, Counter Terrorism Department.
SWAT training for the personnel started about a month ago at the Police Lines Headquarters. A team from the army is currently providing training to the force. 
The requisition for the two majors and SSG personnel was made to formalise and officialise the arrangement.
Out of the total, the two majors and six SSG personnel will be placed on secondment at the disposal of the police for training the SWAT force, while the remaining personnel will be posted at the NPA to train under-training assistant superintendents of police (ASPs).

A police team was staying in Islamabad for the last 10 days or so when they got a tip-off that the suspect, Waseem Akthar, was hiding somewhere in the federal capital.
He was nominated in multiple FIRs lodged by his fellow jewellers besides his own stepmother.
The major fraud case surfaced in the second week of December 2025 when several jewellers of Madina Jewellers Market Ichhra after they came to know that Waseem had disappeared suddenly with 20kg of gold worth over Rs1 billion they had “invested” with him for decades.
The lockers of the suspect’s shop where they had deposited the gold ornaments were found unlocked at the time when the affected jewellers visited the premises.
An official, privy to the development, said the suspect kept on changing his location and the police finally managed to arrest him and his wife.
The official source claimed that the Lahore Police wanted to do the interrogation in their own style to ensure the maximum recovery of the gold he had made off with.
For this purpose, the police high-ups issued some instructions to keep the arrest secret, the source said. But the officers’ plan was spoiled when Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on a social media platform claimed the suspect had been arrested.
The police source claimed that the offences/charges mentioned in the FIRs against the suspect as compared to his scale of crime were not strong enough to take him to the court of law for some major punishment. So the police officers decided to investigate the case ‘in a traditional way’ by interrogating the suspect without showing his arrest in the official record, the official claimed.
He added that the most concerning part of the case was that the suspect had reportedly sold everything, including his house, cars, and most probably the huge amount of the gold he had taken away.
As per the reports, an affected jeweller, Ahmad Siddiqui, told the police that he had handed over gold ornaments worth over Rs25m to Waseem Akhtar, the suspect who was the former president of Ichhra Jewellers Association. He said the suspect had been running his business, Madina Jewellers, for the last 35 years and had won the trust of the area jewellers. He said Waseem committed a criminal breach of trust, depriving dozens of his fellow jewellers of their valuables.
In another FIR lodged by a woman with the Ichhra Police Station told the police that the absconding suspect was her stepson and she had handed him over 2.5kg of her gold.
Meanwhile, the investigation wing police released a statement, announcing that Waseem Akthar had been arrested from Islamabad.
The police said he was nominated in multiple FIRs registered on the complaints of the affected jewellers of Ichhra market and further investigations were underway, refusing to share more details.

Speaking at the International Law Year in Review 2026 Conference on Thursday, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the erosion of treaty obligations and uneven application of international law were undermining the foundations of collective security built after World War II.
“There must be no space for selective compliance or legal exceptionalism,” the ambassador said, adding that the principles of the UN Charter must be applied “more consistently, more courageously and more faithfully” if the rules-based international order was to survive.







Ambassador Asim linked the debate on international law directly to the functioning of the Security Council, noting that divisions among major powers had increasingly paralysed the body. He cited the unanimous adoption of Resolution 2788 during Pakistan’s presidency of the Council in July last year as an exception that underscored what was still possible within the UN framework.
The resolution, he said, “reaffirms the centrality of peaceful settlement of disputes” and demonstrated that consensus could still be achieved despite geopolitical rivalries.
At the same time, he warned that disregard for binding international agreements posed a direct challenge to the UN system. Referring to India’s unilateral move to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, Ambassador Asim said such actions reflected a “disturbing trend” that weakened confidence in international law and threatened regional stability.
On the long-stalled issue of Security Council reform, Pakistan reiterated its opposition to models that expand permanent membership or perpetuate veto privileges. Any reform, the ambassador said, should “not exacerbate the fundamental flaws entrenched in permanent membership and veto” but should instead “enhance the relative weight and power of the elected members”, whose voices represented the wider UN membership.
He also drew attention to the growing agenda before the UN related to emerging technologies, arguing that the organisation must play a central role in shaping legal norms on artificial intelligence, cyber operations and autonomous weapons.
Praising the work of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Law Commission (ILC), he called for the “progressive development of international law” to prevent new domains of conflict from remaining unregulated.
Despite persistent criticism of the UN’s effectiveness, Ambassador Asim said the institution continued to command broad legitimacy. “The vast majority of member states have deep faith in the UN and multilateralism,” he said, stressing that the answer lay in reform and renewal rather than marginalisation of the world body.
Diplomatic discussions at the UN this week have reflected similar concerns, with several delegations privately cautioning against the proliferation of ad hoc mechanisms that operate outside established UN processes, even when presented as complementary.
Earlier on Thursday, Pakistan joined 19 other nations in endorsing the charter of a proposed “Board of Peace”, an initiative led by United States President Donald Trump. While Washington has said the body would work “in conjunction” with the UN, diplomats noted that the proposed group could end up supplementing — or potentially complicating — the UN’s role in maintaining international peace and stability.
For many at the UN, the central question remains whether new initiatives can reinforce — rather than dilute — the authority of the organisation at a moment when conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere have already placed unprecedented strain on the multilateral system.</p><small>2026-01-23 04:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6972c11826c57.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968535/heavy-snowfall-hinders-routine-life-across-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy snowfall hinders routine life across Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>• Power outages, gas shortages hit residents hard amid freezing temperature• Several roads blocked; machinery deployed; public urged to stay home
QUETTA: Heavy downpour and snowfall blanketed the Quetta valley and vast parts of northern and central Balochistan on Thursday, ending a long dry spell but paralysing normal life.
The severe weather blocked major highways, cutting off the provincial capital, while lashing Siberian winds caused temperatures to plummet across the region.
Authorities reported that six members of a family were injured when their vehicle skidded off the Quetta-Karachi national highway in the Surab area of Kalat district due to freezing snow. The injured were shifted to a district hospital.
Consequently, officials suspended traffic on various highways connecting Balochistan with other provinces and linking remote districts to Quetta, citing dangerous, slippery conditions caused by high-speed icy winds.
The extreme weather affected more than just transportation. Cities and towns connected to the Sui Southern Gas Company, inclu­ding Quetta, suffered long power breakouts and low gas pressure.
These utility failures caused significant hardship for residents facing freezing temperatures, which were recorded between minus 8 and minus 12 degrees Celsius in Quetta, Ziarat, Kalat, Mastung, Kan Mehtarzai, Khanozai, Muslim Bagh, Qila Abdullah, Sanjavi and many other cities.
The Met Office forecast more rain and snowfall in the next 24 hours due to Siberian winds, which have also frozen large areas in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, residents witnessed Quetta wearing a “white blanket” for the first time in at least five years. The last heavy snowfall occurred in 2020, when the capital received 3 feet of snow and northern parts saw up to 6 feet, leaving the province cut off for days.
Mountains surrounding the valley, including Hanna Lake and Urak Valley, turned white, prompting locals to flock to these areas to enjoy the season’s first snow.
The other areas of the province that received snowfall and rain included Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat, Qila Saifullah, Muslim Bagh, Khanozai, Kan Mehtarzai, Chaman, Toba Achakzai, Mastung, Kalat, Harboi, Surab, Toba Kakari, Sanjavi, Duki and other areas.
According to sources, Ziarat, Khanozai, Muslim Bagh, Kalat, Toba Achakzai and Toba Kakari received two to three feet of snow.
Traffic on the highway from Balochistan to D.I. Khan and Islamabad via Zhob was suspended due to snow. The Khojak Pass to Afghanistan via Chaman was also closed to prevent accidents.
Authorities worked to clear highways and spread salt to melt ice. The public was advised to avoid unnecessary travel as heavy machinery helped restore traffic.

He announced PTI’s dissociation from the bill and sought its withdrawal.
Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the Chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
Tax bill
On Thursday, the House also passed the Income Tax Third Amendment Bill 2025, moved by Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, who said it aimed to safeguard taxpayers’ rights and strengthen the Alternate Dispute Resolution Com­mittee.

The National Assembly was informed that billions of dollars in investment had been attracted through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said investments had come across multiple sectors, supported by initiatives such as the investment policy and revised visa policy. Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani added that the SIFC functioned as a single window to promote investment and transparency.
Furthermore, seven new bills were laid before the assembly for consideration. These included the National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority Bill, the National Archives Amendment Bill, 2026, and the Abandoned Properties Management Amendment Bill, 2026.

LAHORE: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on kite flying in public parks and greenbelts on Basant, as the Lahore administration decided to digitally monitor the three-day festival, starting Feb 6, to ensure compliance.
PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad said the decision was made to ensure that kite flying and related celebrations did not harm trees and other park infrastructure.
“Since the Basant festival is being held for three days in Lahore alone, the arrival of a number of people from other cities of Punjab, other provinces and abroad is expected here for kite flying and other related activities.
In such a situation, the people may rush for the public parks and green areas for kite flying and other related celebrations…” he told Dawn.

 

He said the decision was made to prevent any untoward incident, including damage to the plants, greenbelts and other infrastructure.
“Lahore, in addition to its huge number of permanent residents, may also have a considerable number of people from other cities and countries starting from the Feb 4 evening, since Feb 5 is also a public holiday (Youm-i-Kashmir),” he added.
“The parks would remain open to the people, but they wouldn’t be allowed for kite flying,” he said, adding that the PHA enforcement staff has been put on high alert.
According to an official notification by the PHA, the directors concerned have been asked to ensure strict implementation of the ban within their respective zones.
The authority emphasised that any violation of these instructions will be considered unacceptable, and in case of any damage or untoward incident, the respective director would be held responsible.
Digital monitoring
Meanwhile, the city district administration said that strict digital monitoring of Basant would be carried out through drone cameras and the Lahore Safe City Authority’s cameras. A control room would be set up at the DC office.
It was revealed in a meeting presided over by Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz.
“Kite flying will only be allowed from Feb 6 to 8, whereas the material will be sold through registered dealers alone,” the DC said while speaking on the occasion.
He said that kites bigger than the ap­­pro­ved sizes will be prohibited. More­over, none of the bikers would be allowed to drive without safety wires. Basant would only be allowed at specific grounds or no­­tified rooftops, including in the Walled City or other locations across the district.
Registration of kite manufacturers
On the other hand, as many as 2,437 kite manufacturers, sellers, traders and associations have applied for registration with the city administration for the festival.
According to a document seen by Dawn, as many as 1,334 kite sellers applied for registration till Jan 22, 2026. Out of this, 161 applications were currently in process, whereas 1,107 had been approved.
A total of 838 kite manufacturers applied for registration, 697 applications had been approved, whereas 85 were in process. However, 51 applications were rejected.
Similarly, 250 kite traders applied for registration, out of which 19 applications were in process and 223 had been appro­ved. Eight applications were rejected.
Moreover, 18 kite flying associations applied for registration, of which 12 were approved, two are in process, while four applications were rejected.
It is pertinent to mention that the provincial government decided in December last year to celebrate a limited Basant in Lahore with strict conditions.

“Safeguarding an employee’s right to be considered for promotion in a timely manner is a right,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik, adding that the government departments cannot take shelter behind their inefficiencies and inactions by relying on Section 8(3) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act 1974, as they are responsible for ensuring timely promotions.
The observation came in an appeal of Fakhar Majeed before the Supreme Court, which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Ayesha A. Malik, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim had taken up against a February 16, 2024, order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, which had dismissed his plea.
The Supreme Court, however, ordered the Punjab Irrigation Department to grant promotion to the employee from 2012 and held the department responsible for an “unjustified”, “negligent”, and “inefficient” delay in processing his promotion for over a decade. The petitioner stated that he was entitled to a proforma promotion, effective January 18, 2010, as the vacancy for the post of draftsman (BPS-14) became available on that date. 

Court says civil servants should not suffer due to procedural delays, inaction of government departments

The department, on the other hand, pleaded that in terms of Section 8 of the Act, the employee did not have any right to seek proforma promotion from the date of vacancy, rather promotion was to be granted with immediate effect.
Petitioner Fakhar Majeed was appointed on Oct 30, 1999, and later promoted to the post of draftsman on current charge basis three times in BPS-10 through letters dated Dec 11, 2008, June 2, 2010, and Nov 12, 2011, for a period not exceeding one year under Rule 10(b) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Condition of Services) Rules 1974 or till the arrival of regular incumbent whichever is earlier. 
A Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was convened in 2012, but his case was not considered. This became the subject matter of a dispute between the parties. 
The employee was ultimately recommended for promotion to the post of draftsman by the DPC held on May 4, 2019, and thereafter promoted through an office order of May 7, 2019. 
The petitioner claimed that he was not treated fairly and was denied the lawful right of being considered for promotion in 2012. The issue, therefore, is the petitioner’s request for regular promotion to the post of draftsman (BPS-14) with effect from Jan 18, 2010.
Authored by Justice Malik, the seven-page judgement observed that it must be remembered that promotion in public service was not a gratuitous benefit, rather it was tied to merit, performance and operational needs of the state.
Once an employee satisfies the prescribed eligibility criteria, a corresponding duty devolves on the competent authority to consider the case, failing which a reasonable timeframe must be documented, Justice Malik observed.
By relying on Section 8(3) of the Act, the department actually tried to nullify the delay, its mismanagement and inefficiency. Fairness, transparency and timeliness in promotion matters are critical to keep employees efficient and motivated, the judgement emphasised.
It said that a delay, failure to convene DPC, or prolonged reliance on current charge or acting arrangements cannot be used to defeat the right of an eligible civil servant to timely consideration for promotion, and that a civil servant cannot be made to suffer for omissions, inefficiency or inaction.
The Supreme Court ruled that the tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that the employee was unjustifiably deprived of the promotion, and set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction that the petitioner be deemed promoted with effect from Jan 21, 2012.

• iPhones see steepest cuts  • Values apply regardless of condition; accessories not included
• Phones must be activated six months before import      
ISLAMABAD: As mobile phone prices remain elevated for new buyers due to higher assessed values, the Customs Valuation Department has reduced assessment rates for duties and taxes on the commercial import of used and old mobile phone sets to ease pressure on consumers in the used smartphone market.
At the same time, fresh assessment values have been set for high-end used iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 14 and its variants to the iPhone 15 series. For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.
The revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.
Customs officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.
The downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.
Officials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
The government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.
A comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.
Among the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.
The iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.
Even newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.
The department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.
For the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.
Samsung, Google, OnePlus
By contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.
Other Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.
For Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.

According to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.
It further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.
Customs officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.
For brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.
