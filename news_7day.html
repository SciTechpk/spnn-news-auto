Speaking to Dawn.com, Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar confirmed the death and injury toll. He said, “Ten people have been killed while thirty-two were injured in the blast. The injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre.”
Meanwhile, Civil Lines Police Station House Officer (SHO) Ameen Jaffar told Dawn.com that “eight bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital after the blast.”
According to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Special Operations Quetta Muhammad Baloch, “The blast took place when a vehicle turned from Model Town towards Hali Road, close to the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters.”
Television and social media footage captured the moment when the powerful explosion ripped through the street.
 
  @dawn.today At least 10 people were killed and 32 were injured on Tuesday after a bomb blast ripped through a busy street in Quetta, Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn.com. “Thirty-two injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre,” Kakar said. Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. “An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said.

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “terrorist attack.”
“Following the incident, security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists,” a post from the Balochistan government’s X account quoted him as saying.
“The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured.”
 






Later, speaking during an event in Quetta, he said that “an operation against the terrorists is underway.”
President Asif Ali Zardari, on the other hand, said it was a “suicide attack.”
“The president has strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij, the misguided extremists acting on India’s agenda,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The president said that the elements serving the interests of Fitna-al-Khawarij and India cannot undermine Pakistan’s peace and stability. He commended the security forces for their timely and effective response, which foiled the malicious designs of the terrorists.”
Per the statement, the president “prayed for the swift recovery of the injured FC personnel and lauded the courage and resolve of the country’s security forces in defending the motherland.”
Six injured in critical condition, emergency declared in hospitals
Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
“An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said.
“All consultants, doctors, pharmacists, staff nurses, and paramedical staff have been directed to remain present in the hospitals.”
Speaking to the media later during a visit to the Civil Hospital, Health Minister Kakar said that the condition of six injured people was critical.
“A major terrorist plot was planned. I strongly condemn the blast near FC headquarters,” he said, adding that most of the injured were civilians.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.

The hundred index surged to an intraday peak of 166,556.29, marking a gain of 2,708.61 points or 1.65 per cent, while its lowest level of the day was 164,208.33, still up by 360.65 points or 0.22pc.
The continued upward trend in the stock exchange reflected the increasing confidence of the trade and business community in the economic policies of the government.
“Strong corporate results and additional liquidity in the market, with a preference for equities, are pushing the market higher,” Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, told Dawn.com.
This was the third consecutive record-setting streak, with the benchmark KSE 100 index soaring to an all-time high of 163,847 points, up 1,590 points or 0.98pc on Monday. The rally, which pushed the index closer to the 164,000 mark, was largely driven by aggressive local mutual fund buying and institutional inflows.
Earlier this week, the stock market index crossed the 162,000-point threshold for the first time, buoyed by a series of geopolitical and economic developments. These included the signing of a Rs1.275tr financing facility with 18 commercial banks to address the power sector’s circular debt, and a strategic defence agreement with Saudi Arabia that raised hopes of enhanced bilateral trade and financial support.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is firmly in its optimism phase, supported by signs of an economic recovery and a steadily improving geopolitical news flow.
“The rally is being powered by fresh retail participation alongside sustained mutual fund inflows, lifting breadth and turnover. With positioning constructive, all eyes are now on the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) review, which most participants expect to conclude smoothly — keeping risk appetite intact unless any surprises emerge.”
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, added that investors were “optimistic” about a successful review and potential foreign direct investment, given improved relations with the United States and Saudi Arabia.
As the government ent­ers the crucial stage of neg­otiations with the IMF, market participants remain hopeful that any progress on the review will streng­then investor confidence. However, concerns linger regarding the ongoing review and its impact on Pakistan’s fiscal stability, with some analysts noting that achieving targets set by the IMF remains a challenging task.</p><small>2025-09-30 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/301523383c3fb4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945637/two-state-surrender-pms-endorsement-of-trumps-gaza-plan-draws-strong-reactions-from-political-sphere' target='_blank'><strong>‘Two-state surrender’: PM’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza plan draws strong reactions from political sphere</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza, seeking to broker a ceasefire, a hostage exchange, demilitarisation, and a transitional governance structure.
The two leaders have warned that Israel would “finish the job” against Hamas if the Palestinian group rejects the deal. Key Muslim nations have thrown their weight behind the plan while Washington’s European allies have urged Hamas to accept it.
For its part, Pakistan, which was personally thanked by Trump while announcing the deal, has hailed the 20-point plan; Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has welcomed it and called for implementation of the two-state solution.
“I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,“ he said in a post on X on Sunday night.
 






The prime minister’s remarks, however, have sparked strong reactions at home, with politicians, analysts, journalists, and activists criticising his endorsement of the Trump plan and terming it a “surrender”.
Author and former diplomat Abdul Basit said: “This is a complete surrender by the Muslim world. They can’t even mention a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
He added that it would be a “huge mistake” for Pakistan to join the Abraham Accords before the establishment of the State of Palestine.
As part of the Abraham Accords, signed during Trump’s first term in office, four Muslim-majority countries had agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation.
 






He also questioned why the premier was supporting the plan “knowing full well that it is literally ruling out any possibility of creating state of Palestine”.
 






Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir termed Trump’s plan a “flawed and unjust proposal that disregards the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people”.
“This secretive plan, crafted without open dialogue, excludes Palestinians and imposes a US-centric solution that prioritises Israeli interests over Palestinian justice,” he said.
He said that the plan sidelined key Palestinian voices, demanded the dissolution of Hamas without addressing its support base and was vague on the issue of Palestinian statehood. It also ignored critical matters such as the status of Jerusalem and Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, he said.
“No solution can succeed without the meaningful participation of the Palestinian people and all stakeholders. A top-down dictate from Washington stands no chance,” he said.
He added that PM Shehbaz’s “hasty endorsement of this plan — betraying both the Palestinian cause and Pakistan’s historic solidarity with it — is surprising”.
“His support for a US-driven framework, without consulting the Pakistani people, who share a deep emotional attachment to the Palestinian cause, or ensuring Palestinian inclusion, undermines that very cause. Only a transparent, inclusive peace process that centres Palestinian voices and delivers true sovereignty can bring peace — not a plan that perpetuates occupation under the guise of peace,” he said.
 






“There is one issue on which there is complete consensus in Pakistan and that is the issue of Palestine,” said human rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.
“This Zionist slave and his masters will never be forgiven by the people of Pakistan for this,” she said.
 






Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said that her Pakistani passport prohibited her from entering Israel as the country she belonged to had a “duty” to the Palestinian people.
“A Pakistan that forsakes that moral and sacred obligation is an embarrassment and a humiliation,” she said.
 






She said that the Pakistani people would never accept a “two-state surrender”. “There is only one Palestine and it is occupied by Israel, a criminal genocidal entity,” she said.
“To speak of normalisation during Israel’s live-streamed Holocaust of our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a shattering betrayal. Why does Pakistan exist? It’s a state to protect Muslims. It should do so,” she said.
 






Journalist Talat Hussain also criticised the plan, saying “The Plan: No Palestinian state; No Palestinian Authority in Gaza; Hamas goes to dustbin of history after releasing all prisoners; Netanyahu becomes the peace maker after killing 64,000 Palestinians; Trump runs Gaza as real estate bonanza in a land soaked in fresh blood.”
 






In a thread on X, journalist Zarrar Khuhro said: “Standing next to a war criminal, Trump has presented a ‘plan’ that can never really work and which Israel will itself sabotage in no time while blaming Palestinians.”
He noted that the official line had always been a two-state solution, not just from Pakistan, but from a majority of nations.
He said that all the plan would likely be was a way to “whitewash Israel and provide an alternative target for the anger of Palestinians. Should stay away from any such proposals given the ground realities and the nature of genocidal Israel.”
“Whatever the ‘incentives’, the government of Pakistan must not endorse the whitewashing of Israel or join in a security arrangement that amounts to further oppression of Palestinians. This will be absolutely unacceptable to all Pakistanis,” he said.
“In any case, as of yet, there has been no response from Hamas or any other Palestinian group as yet. We know that Israel sets impossible conditions exactly so that they are rejected and they can carry out their agenda of extermination. This new ‘plan’ will likely end the same,” he said.
 






Activist Ammar Ali Jan reacted to the premier’s post, saying, “Shame on you for talking about ‘peace’ with the Zionist entity at a time when it is committing a genocide of Palestinians.
“The people of Pakistan will never forgive those who join Trump’s plan for normalising these genocidal maniacs. Don’t dare cross this red line,” he said.
 






Veteran politician Javed Hashmi said that Quaid-i-Azam’s stance was clear that Israel was a “bastard state”.
“Shame on you, your masters, and those puppets whose hands drip with the blood of Palestinians. History won’t forgive you,” he said.
 






Jamaat-i-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that his party categorically rejected the premier’s statement.
“The United Nations Charter is clear: every nation has the right to armed struggle if its land is occupied, and no power can forcibly deny this right. To praise any so-called peace proposal built upon the bodies of 66,000 martyred Palestinians is to stand with the oppressors,” he said.
“Without the will and consent of the Pakistani nation, how can any individual dare to speak in the voice of Donald Trump?” he asked.
 






Former finance minister Asad Umar said that PM Shehbaz had “overturned a cornerstone of Pakistan policy for decades regarding Palestine, by supporting the Trump plan”.
“He has done this without any national debate and mandate from the nation,” he said, adding that there were seven questions the premier needed to answer.
“The plan says Gaza will be deradicalised and become a terror-free zone. Why does it not say the same about Israel, which is the most radical country in the world and a threat to world peace?” he asked.
“Israeli hostages will be released immediately but Israel will withdraw in an undefined future time in phases. With Israeli history of breaking every peace accord, why is it being trusted and not withdrawing immediately?” he continued.
“How can you support only 600 trucks per day [of] relief goods for a population of more than two million, many on brink of starvation? Even this level agreed in the Jan 2025 accord has not been allowed by Israel,” he pointed out.
He also took issue with the implementation of a technocratic government in Gaza being supervised by the US. “Why lectures of democracy for the rest of the world and an effectively colonised technocracy for Gaza?”
“Hamas will not have any role in Gaza but Netanyahu, who has attacked five sovereign nations in last year and killed more than 66,000 Gazans, including 20,000 children, allowed to continue?” Umar continued.
“When redevelopment is advanced, conditions may be in place for a pathway to Palestinian statehood!!! In other words no two-state solution for decades and probably never. How can you support this treachery?” he questioned.
“Why is there no word about stopping and evacuating the illegal Israeli settlements?”
 






Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar termed the joint statement issued by Muslim countries a “surrender”.
“Netanyahu goes scot-free after committing genocide!” he said.

According to the report, PCB Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmad Syed issued a notice to the players and their agents, making the announcement.
The notification, seen by ESPNcricinfo, read: “With the approval of chairman PCB, all NOCs for players with respect to participation in leagues and other out of country tournaments are hereby put on hold until further orders.”
According to the publication, the reason behind the move is currently unknown.
“Reports have suggested the PCB aims to tie NOCs to a performance based system, the criteria for which has not been made public. The goal, from the board’s perspective, is for players to incentivise national and domestic performances. However, there is no information on how long such an evaluation will take before the current suspension on NOCs is lifted,” the report said.
According to ESPNcricinfo, seven Pakistani players, including Babar Azam, Muhammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi, are expected to take part in  Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) which will be held in December.
Additionally, 16 Pakistani players, including Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman, are in the shortlist to participate in the International League T20 auction which will be held on October 1 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s own domestic first-class tournament, the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, will begin on October 26, with 18 regional teams, divided into three groups, vying for a win.
The development comes two days after the Green Shirts lost the Asia Cup 2025 final against arch-rivals India, after also having lost twice to the Indian team in previous matches during the tournament. The tournament had come on the heels of Pakistan winning the T20 International tri-series which included Afghanistan and the UAE.</p><small>2025-09-30 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/3010424062e42b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945628/sc-declares-ihc-order-barring-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work-null-and-void' target='_blank'><strong>SC declares IHC order barring Justice Jahangiri from judicial work ‘null and void’</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday declared Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Sept 16 decision to bar Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri from judicial work “null and void”, a day after the apex court ordered the decision’s suspension.
Yesterday, the court adjourned the hearing to September 30 (today) and issued notices to all the respondents, as well as the Attorney General of Pakistan  (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, to appear before the court.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
Resuming the hearing today, the five-member Constitutional Bench — headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan — took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
AGP Awan appeared before the court and said, “A judge cannot be barred from judicial work through an interim order.“
At this, Justice Aminuddin asked respondent Mian Daud, who had filed the original petition against Justice Jahangiri, for his opinion. In response, Daud said: “I hold the same opinion — a judge cannot be stopped from judicial work.”
He added that “an order barring a judge from their duties can not be defended.”
Noting the AGP’s statement and that of other relevant parties, Justice Aminuddin set aside the IHC order, ruling that a judge can not be stopped from carrying out judicial duties.
The CB, while referring to the SC registrar’s office objections regarding the petition against Justice Jahangiri in the IHC, directed the court to “first decide on the objections in the writ petition.”
During the hearing, the matter of the maintainability of the writ petition came under discussion as Justice Jahangiri’s legal counsel, Munir Malik, addressed the court and said, “according to yesterday’s court order, it was written that the writ is maintainable, but in my opinion, only the SJC can take action against a judge.”
At yesterday’s hearing, the CB had made it clear that it would only examine the Sept 16 restraining order and not the main petition questioning Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
“No one should be under the impression that we have accepted the high court’s jurisdiction to hear the writ petition,” he added, referring to the Malik Asad Ali case.
To this, Justice Aminuddin responded: “We have written in the order only the language that is present in the Malik Asad Ali case.”
In his remarks, Justice Mandokhel said, “We have only maintained that a judge may only be removed by the SJC.”
Justice Mazhar asserted that, “We are not touching on the question of the maintainability of the writ of quo warranto. Whether it merited a hearing in a high court is up to the relevant high court to decide.
“The only question before us is whether a judge can be prevented from working through an interim order,” he said, stressing that the CB at the moment “will not address the question of whether a writ petition can be filed against a judge.”
“Both the Supreme Court and High Court judges are not office holders, Justice Mandokhel observed, but then went on to say that “all of these things can be discussed when the case is heard on merit.”
“We do not want to go on merit in the present case,” he said.
On Monday, the SC suspended the order issued by the IHC barring Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) is set to hear a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri today, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
Justice Jahangiri has impugned the decisions of University of Karachi’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The IHC judge recently approached the SHC, but at the time of filing, the court’s additional registrar (writ) raised several objections, including questions about the maintainability of the petition and the delay in filing it.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.</p><small>2025-09-30 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/301343190bbc5dc.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945638/18-member-squad-announced-for-pakistan-vs-south-africa-test-series' target='_blank'><strong>18-member squad announced for Pakistan vs South Africa Test series</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board’s national selection committee has named an 18-member squad for the two-Test match series against South Africa, part of the ICC World Test Championship 2025-27, commencing on October 12, an official statement confirmed on Tuesday.
Shan Masood will continue to lead the side, while three uncapped players — Asif Afridi, Faisal Akram and Rohail Nazir — have also been included. The squad will be further trimmed before the start of the first Test match.
South Africa, who were the champions of the ICC World Test Championship 2023-25, will take on Pakistan in the first Test at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from 12 to 16 October, while the second Test will be staged at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi from 20 to 24 October.
The two-Test match series will be followed by three T20 Internationals (T20Is) and as many One Day Internationals (ODIs) to be played from October 28 to  November 8. The squad for the white-ball series will be announced in due course.
 
 

The PCB said that players for the pre-series camp will undergo training under red-ball head coach Azhar Mahmood and National Cricket Academy (NCA) coaches later today, until Wednesday, October 8. The players who featured in the recently concluded Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Men’s T20 Asia Cup will join the squad on October 4.
The Pakistan squad will consist of Shan Masood (captain), Aamir Jamal, Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Asif Afridi, Babar Azam, Faisal Akram, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Kamran Ghulam, Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket-keeper), Noman Ali, Rohail Nazir (wicket-keeper), Sajid Khan, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel and Shaheen Shah Afridi.
 






The announcement comes on the heels of Pakistan’s disastrous loss of the Asia Cup to India, in a dramatic final on Sunday marred by political tensions.

The government began shutting down high-speed internet connections to some provinces earlier in the month to prevent “vice” on the orders of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
On Monday night, mobile phone signal and internet service gradually weakened nationwide until connectivity was less than one per cent of ordinary levels, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks.
 






It is the first time since the Taliban government won their insurgency in 2021 and imposed Sharia law that communications have been shut down in the country.
“We are blind without phones and internet,” said 42-year-old shopkeeper Najibullah in Kabul.
“All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It’s like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.”
In the minutes before it happened, a government official warned AFP that the fibre optic network would be cut, affecting mobile phone services too.
“Eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be shut down, he said, adding that the blackout would last “until further notice”.
“There isn’t any other way or system to communicate … the banking sector, customs, everything across the country will be affected,” said the official who asked not to be named.
The Taliban leader reportedly ignored warnings from some officials earlier this month about the economic fallout of cutting the internet and ordered authorities to press ahead with a nationwide ban.
Radio communications
Diplomatic sources told AFP on Tuesday that mobile networks were mostly shut down.
A UN source, meanwhile, said “operations are severely impacted, falling back to radio communications and limited satellite links”.
Telephone services are often routed over the internet, sharing the same fibre optic lines, especially in countries with limited telecoms infrastructure.
Over the past weeks, internet connections have been extremely slow or intermittent.
On September 16, Balkh provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said the ban had come from the Taliban leader’s orders.
“This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media.
At the time, AFP correspondents reported the same restrictions in the northern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar, as well as in Kandahar, Helmand, Nangarhar and Uruzgan in the south.
Netblocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout “appears consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”.
AFP lost all contact with its bureau in the capital Kabul at around 5:45pm (6:15pm PKT) on Monday.
“Because of the shutdown, I’m totally disconnected with my family in Kabul,” a 40-year-old Afghan living in Oman told AFP via text message, asking not to be named.
“I don’t know what’s happening, I’m really worried.”
In 2024, Kabul had touted the 9,350 kilometre fibre optic network — largely built by former US-backed governments — as a “priority” to bring the country closer to the rest of the world and lift it out of poverty.</p><small>2025-09-30 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/3010233373c53ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945627/adb-says-sustained-reforms-disaster-resilience-key-to-pakistans-continued-economic-growth' target='_blank'><strong>ADB says sustained reforms, disaster resilience key to Pakistan’s continued economic growth</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic conditions have contributed to an uptick in growth in fiscal year 2025, underpinned by increased investment driven by continued policy reforms and economic stability, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report today.
According to the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) September 2025, the ADB’s annual flagship economic publication, Pakistan’s growth is projected to continue in the medium-term, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast at three per cent in fiscal year 2026 as macroeconomic stability deepens through sustained reforms addressing structural vulnerabilities.
It said that economic reform had progressed considerably under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that began in October 2024.
“Policy consistency and climate resilience remain vital to maintaining the growth momentum. Downside risks to the outlook remain high,” the ADB report said.
Meanwhile, ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan was quoted as saying, “Pakistan’s growth prospects remain positive. However, the country continues to face structural challenges, compounded by recurring disasters such as the recent floods. In this context, consistent reforms and policy implementation are essential for reinforcing policy credibility, sustaining economic momentum, and enhancing the country’s resilience.”
‘Floods may weigh on growth’
The report said that in the new fiscal year, economic activity is expected to strengthen, supported by improved external buffers and renewed business confidence following the US-Pakistan trade agreement.
However, the damage caused to infrastructure and farmland by the recent floods may weigh on growth, it said.
“Recovery and rehabilitation efforts, bolstered by fiscal incentives for the construction sector announced in the FY2026 budget, are expected to partially offset the adverse impact,” it added.
It further said that average inflation is projected to increase to six per cent in fiscal year 2026, reflecting the impact of flood-related supply chain disruptions on food prices and the increase in gas tariffs. “In response, the central bank is expected to adopt a cautious approach to easing monetary policy to stabilise inflation within its medium-term target range of five per cent to seven per cent,” it said.
It further stated that investment is anticipated to increase with greater business confidence, declining interest rates, and adherence to fiscal consolidation, which will lower government borrowing needs and allow more lending for private investment. Key tariff reforms under the updated National Tariff Policy 2025–2030 and liquidity support for exporters through a digitalised income tax refund system will improve export competitiveness, also encouraging private investment, the report added.
Workers’ remittances will be bolstered by maintaining external stability through a robust policy framework and a stable exchange rate, and by the need to support families back home who struggle to recover from the floods. Higher remittances may partly offset a decline in private consumption resulting from lower agricultural output and, consequently, reduced farm incomes, it detailed.
It noted that the government aims to sustain fiscal consolidation by increasing revenue and containing spending. The FY2026 budget targets a primary surplus equal to 2.4 per cent of GDP and an overall deficit of 3.9 per cent, gradually declining over the medium-term. Tax revenue is projected to reach 13.2 per cent of GDP in fiscal year 2026, underpinned by tax administration and policy efforts, it said.
‘External balance forecast to remain stable over medium-term’
Meanwhile, the report stated that the external balance is forecast to remain stable over the medium-term. Export growth is expected to remain subdued by flood-related disruption to rice and cotton production. However, improved liquidity — driven by faster tax refunds and lower production costs under supportive monetary conditions — may help offset the impact of reduced agricultural output, it said.
Imports are expected to grow faster as food imports increase to address flood-induced shortages and raw material imports increase because of the expected recovery in manufacturing, thereby widening the trade deficit. However, a more functional foreign exchange market with a flexible exchange rate is expected to ensure resilience in workers’ remittances and keep the current account nearly balanced in fiscal year 2026, the report said.
Higher multilateral and bilateral inflows, including flood relief and assistance, along with ongoing central bank foreign exchange purchases, are expected to raise gross international reserves in June 2026 to $17.7 billion, providing 2.8 months of import cover, it said.</p><small>2025-09-30 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30120913dadb19d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945630/us-deports-100-iranians-after-deal-with-tehran-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>US deports 100 Iranians after deal with Tehran, says report</strong></a><br><p>The United States is deporting around 100 Iranians back to Iran, the New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing two senior Iranian officials involved in the negotiations and a US official with knowledge of the plans.
A US-chartered flight took off from Louisiana on Monday and was scheduled to arrive in Iran by way of Qatar sometime on Tuesday, according to the report.
The deportation, an uncommon instance of cooperation between the two countries, came after months of talks, the newspaper said.
The White House and the US State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
US President Donald Trump plans to deport a record number of people living in the US without legal status, arguing that it is necessary after what he describes as high illegal border crossings under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.
However, his administration has struggled to increase deportation levels, even as it has created new avenues to send migrants to countries other than their own.
The identities of the Iranians and their reasons for attempting to immigrate to the US were not immediately clear, the paper said, adding that some had volunteered to leave after being in detention centres for months, and some had not.
According to the New York Times, Iran’s foreign ministry was coordinating the return of the deportees, who had been given reassurances that they would be safe and would not face any problems.

Players, pundits and politicians from both sides continued to trade barbs on Monday, following team India’s refusal to accept the winning trophy from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi — who also serves as Pakistan’s interior minister and head of the cricket board.
Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “disrespected cricket”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides.
 
 

The two teams did not shake hands for the third straight match, a thriller that India won by five wickets in Dubai on Sunday.
With ties between the two neighbours at their lowest ebb, India and Pakistan now only meet on neutral territory in international tournaments.
Emotions have been running high between the sides, following a military conflagration between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May, when New Delhi attacked Pakistan after accusing it of being a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir, without any evidence .
On Sunday, the start of the presentation ceremony was delayed by more than an hour and then cut short just before the winner’s trophy was to be handed out with ACC chief Naqvi among those left waiting on the dais.
Subsequently, the Indian players celebrated retaining their regional crown by mimicking holding an imaginary trophy.
Devajit Saikia, secretary of the Indian cricket board confirmed their players had refused to accept the trophy from Mr Naqvi, and threatened to lodge a complaint with cricket’s governing body.
“There is an ICC conference in November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of the ACC chairperson,” he said in a statement, accusing Mr Naqvi of taking the trophy away.
In Suryakumar’s words, the Indian side felt as if they were “denied a trophy”, even though in the same breath, he stated that: “We took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy.
But Salman Agha said India’s actions during the tournament had been “bad for cricket”.
“I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” he told reporters. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.
Political barbs
Hobbled by punishing US tariffs and dumbfounded by Islamabad’s successes on the diplomatic circuit, Indian PM Narendra Modi turned India’s cricket victory over Pakistan in Dubai into a xenophobic event for potentially small stakes: Bihar elections.
His tweet, “Operation Sindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same - India wins! Congrats to our cricketers”, was criticised by some, but they were few and far between.
 






In response, Mohsin Naqvi continued the battlefield imagery: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands. No cricket match can rewrite the truth. Dragging war into sports only exposes your desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he wrote on X.
 






The Indian National Congress, for once, also spoke up against mixing military symbols with sport, with its spokesman Pawan Khera telling the prime minister: “It is not right to compare a cricket match to a battlefield”.
Other Indian leaders praised the cricket win but comments reflected India’s characteristic regionalist pride as well.
A tweet by Indian Home Minister Amir Shah, whose son is now the ICC boss, clearly explained the current thrust of Indian cricket.
“A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.  Bharat is destined to win no matter which field,” he wrote on X.
Old-school cricketer Kapil Dev was not pleased with the mixing of cricket with a battlefield symbol, either.
“Shaking hands is not a big thing, it doesn’t matter… you already announced you don’t want to take the trophy from that man, that’s also fine, but you can’t linger on with these things. You have to finish you have to move on,” he told India Today during an interview.
“We should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, the media has the responsibility to bring everything to the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports,” he said, adding that sportsmen should stick to the game, and let politicians and the cricket board decide what they needed to do.
Former Pakistan keeper Rashid Latif also made no bones about this contempt for the Indian cricket team’s conduct, saying that the move warranted punitive action.
“In any other sport, this would have been an open and shut case,” he said, but noted that this was not likely.
“Ugly day for cricket as India once again breached the spirit and essence of the gentleman’s game, that too in broad daylight,” Latif concluded.

• Trump praises Muslim states for agreeing to demilitarise Gaza; says Pakistan backs deal ‘100pc’ after PM Shehbaz hails 20-point plan
• Hamas receives draft from Qatari, Egyptian officials; no role for outfit in future govt or political process
• World Bank to help form new technocrat govt; plan envisions ‘Board of Peace’ with possible role for Tony Blair
• Netanyahu apologises to Qatar; US president hints at including Iran in Abraham Accords
WASHINGTON: Lifting the veil from his long-awaited plan to end the war in Gaza, President Donald Trump said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu is “very close” to agreeing on a deal.
At a press conference on Monday alongside Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, Trump said that he had worked together with many other countries and hoped that this is “how this situation gets solved”.
Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip.
“This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said.
 
 

During his remarks, President Trump thanked the leaders of Arab and Muslim nations for their support in developing the proposal, as well as US allies in Europe.
“The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump said, referring to a statement issued on Monday by PM Shehbaz.
“They back this 100 per cent,” he said. Earlier, in a post on X, PM Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US president’s “20-point” plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end.
 






“I am … convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region. It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality,” he wrote.
PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict… I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added.
Help from Muslim bloc
At the White House, the US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan. “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations,” he said, indicating that other countries had committed to dealing with Hamas.
Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip.
“Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases — no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated.
“Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added.
“If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do,” he said.
Hamas, meanwhile, said that its officials had received the White House’s 20-point peace proposal.
“Qatari and Egyptian officials have handed over the White House plan to end the war in Gaza to Hamas officials in Doha,” a Palestinian source told BBC News.
Among other things, the proposal calls for the US, Arab states and other international partners to create a temporary International Stabili­sation Force (ISF), which will immediately deploy in Gaza to train law enforcement, which will serve as the long-term internal security force.
The ISF will also be tasked with securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, and will also work to prevent munitions from entering and keep aid and rebuilding materials flowing into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
A joint statement issued by the Saudi foreign ministry, on behalf of the foreign ministers of Jordan, UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Qatar and Egypt welcomes Trump’s leadership and sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza.
 
 

The statement affirmed the Muslim bloc’s readiness to engage positive and constructively with all parties towards finalizing the agreement and ensuring its implementation.
‘Board of Peace’
“To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself.
“We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.” More names would be announced in the coming days, he said.
 
 

Trump added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”.
“Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.”
However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel.
He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages.
“Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said.
“I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.”
Apology to Qatar
Earlier, Netanyahu also expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call with Trump, the White House said.
It added that Netanyahu also expr­essed regret for Israel violating Qatari sovereignty and “affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future“.
Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords.
“They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords.”

The Archaeological Survey of India did claim to find older pillars from around the site of the mosque. The court concluded they were several centuries older than the time of the mosque’s construction and there was no valid explanation that they showed the destruction of a Hindu temple.
The dead rubber question has resurfaced, however, after former chief justice of India Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud claimed last week that erecting the mosque during the reign of the first Mughal emperor Babur was itself an act of desecration.
This was a loaded claim coming from a judge who was on the five-member bench that handed the site of the mosque, which Hindu zealots had destroyed, to those that had supported its destruction against the supreme court’s orders to keep the mosque safe. In the end, though the court decided that it was a criminal act to destroy the mosque, it went on to pave the way for the temple’s construction and its eventual inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the eve of the 2024 elections. Elements so conspired that the BJP lost the seat from Ayodhya to an opposition Dalit candidate.
The Babri Masjid has gone to the winner of the curious court case and temple has come up in its place; possibly it was the only way to contemplate any peace at all given the current ideological preferences of the ruling elite. And yet it may not bring closure to the trauma that continues to be inflicted on the country by state institutions, not excluding the judiciary. In the same interview with intrepid journalist Sreenivasan Jain, justice Chandrachud made another troubling assertion. He was asked why he had allowed another Mug­hal-era mosque in Varanasi to be surveyed, yielding to Hindu revivalist demands and violating the law that all historical monuments built before in­­dependence would be protected by law.
 
 

The judge said this was in deference to the fact that Hindus were praying from inside the mosque’s compound. The following day, Jain paused the clip where the judge made the assertion and ran a fact-check, which clarified that the claim was wrong.
Justice Haider Abbas of the Allahabad High Court — who dealt with the Ayodhya case for years — had told me very lucidly that the claim about Lord Ram being born at the exact site of the then intact mosque was simply not justiciable. India’s secular constitution and its secular laws carry a different brief from religious courts of some other countries. Secular law cannot determine and is not equipped to decide whether a certain god existed, much less that he or she was born at a particular place in this or that district. However, justice Chandrachud’s decision beque­athed 2.77 acres of land, which had been contes­ted for decades, to Ram Lalla Virajman or the inf­­ant deity Ram. The Holy Roman Empire owned a lot of land, but it never had Jesus as its owner.

Justice Chandrachud’s decision bequeathed 2.77 acres of land, which had been contested for decades, to the infant deity Ram.

Just as professional historians or a surgical oncologist cannot supplant judges to decide lawsuits it’s best for the judiciary to keep its distance from pretending to know more about history or oncology than those trained and qualified for the purpose. Suppose Romila Thapar or Harbans Mukhia — though they would frown witheringly at the idea — had led the supreme court bench that decided the fate of the Babri Masjid dispute in favour of Hindu extremists. You could bet your last penny that the outcome would be happily different, and, in any case, only well-grounded historical facts would be entertained.
 
 

After all, the Ayodhya contest was turned into one about faux historical evidence and ownership claims. But could one have marshalled historical evidence about matters of faith? There are science books about how we may have evolved from fish. But there are only religious books and oral traditions about how we were created.
Justice Chandrachud did two other things that betrayed an inkling of where he stood in the saffron surge now visiting India. He says he took the advice of his family deity before delivering the Ayodhya judgement. Then he did what judges would cringe at being made to do. As head of the Allahabad High Court, he had kept a distance between political leadership and the judiciary. In his last days as chief justice, Chandrachud abandoned the rule. He invited Prime Minister Modi to his home to be watched by the nation jointly offering prayers to Hindu deity Ganpati.
Be that as it may, regardless of Chandrachud’s troubling views — and he is surely not alone in the judiciary to hold them — it is actually less than relevant with enlightened societies as to who desecrated whose temples or mosques or churches many centuries ago. The predominantly Hindu Indian state of Kerala hosts among the oldest mosques and synagogues.
The St Mary’s Thiruvithamcode Arappally in Kanyakumari, the oldest church in India was founded by Thomas the Apostle in 63 AD. However, many churches in Europe, admired for their architecture, were, in fact, usurped from old pagan temples. Hindu rulers destroyed Buddhist and Jain temples. Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has converted a former church into a mosque. On the flip side, Muslim Indonesians don’t just preserve their Hindu and Buddhist temples, they flaunt them as a core of Indonesia’s heritage.
Each day a story from the Ramayana is enacted at special venues. All the actors and actresses are Muslim, including orthodox Muslims. The Indian prime minister has taken credit for a grand Hindu temple built in the UAE. However, it was the Muslim rulers of the UAE who showed up as more enlightened.

According to official estimates, based on current tax rates, the ex-depot price of HSD may rise by about Rs2.50 per litre (around 1 per cent), while petrol is likely to go up by Rs1.90-2 per litre. Both products have already recorded a net increase of around Rs13 per litre since mid-May.
At present, the ex-depot price of petrol stands at Rs264.61 per litre. Petrol is widely consumed in private transport, motorcycles, rickshaws, and small vehicles, affecting the daily expenses of middle- and lower-income groups.
The ex-depot price of HSD is Rs272.77 per litre. HSD is mainly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural ma­­chinery, making it an inflation-sensitive product due to its impact on freight and food prices. Trans­po­r­ters had raised fares following a Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, which have not been revised despite a partial price cut of Rs13 per litre in recent weeks.
 
 

Meanwhile, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to rise by about Rs4.50 and Rs1.75 per litre, respectively.

Fuel prices may rise by Rs2-3 per litre from Oct 1

The government currently imposes no GST on petroleum products, but char­ges significant levies. These include Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products, which also cover Rs2.50 per litre under the CSL.
In addition, customs duties of around Rs16-17 per litre apply to both petrol and diesel, regardless of whether the products are imported or locally produced.

• White House official claims the Iraq War veteran ‘hated Mormons’
GRAND BLANC (Mic­h­­i­gan): Authorities on Mon­day were working to determine why an ex-Marine drove his pickup truck into a Michigan church dur­ing a Sunday service, opened fire and set the building ablaze, killing at least four people before he died in a shootout with police.
Hundreds of worshippers were inside the Chu­rch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, when the suspect rammed his pic­k­up truck into the front doors on Sunday morning, officials said.
Two victims were shot to death, and two other bodies were discovered hours later in the rubble of the church, which officials said was deliberately set on fire.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sai­n­ts, based in Utah, follows the teachings of Jesus but also the prophecies of Jos­eph Smith, a 19th-century American. It is informally known as the Mormon Church, a term that its leadership discourages.
Officials warned late on Sunday that some people remained unaccounted for, and that more bodies could yet be found as inve­stigators sifted through the burned-out ruins of the building. At least eight people were wounded.
On Monday, a man drove a car through a barricade that had been set up near the church, CNN reported. The driver was taken into custody, and his identity and intent were not immediately clear, the network said.
The suspect in the shooting was identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from the nearby town of Burton. US military records show Sanford was an Iraq War veteran who served in the Marine Corps from 2004 to 2008.
Authorities did not of­­fer a possible motive, saying they would search the suspect’s home and pho­ne. Grand Blanc Town­ship, a suburb of Flint with a population around 40,000, is about 60 miles northwest of Detroit.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that she spoke with FBI Director Kash Patel on Monday about the attack.
“All they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note,” she said, using a co­­m­­mon term for the church.
Leavitt said the shooter’s family was cooperating with the FBI.
A city council candida­­te in nearby Burton told the Detroit Free Press that he had spoken with Sanford about a week ago, and that the suspect des­cribed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as  “the antichrist.”  The candida­­te, Kris Johns, told the newspaper that the two men did not discuss politics, but that he saw a campaign sign for Presi­dent Trump on the suspect’s fence.

• Protest leaders call for another gathering at Lal Chowk today
MUZAFFARABAD: At least one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured — including a policeman — in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) capital on Monday, as the region observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike amid a communications blackout.
The strike, called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, saw rival groups stage simultaneous protests, which accused each other of fomenting violence during an otherwise peaceful demonstration.
Mobile and internet services have remained suspended in AJK since Sunday noon, and sources said the curbs could continue until Wednesday.
The casualties occurred around Neelum Bridge after midday, when a ‘peace rally’ led by Muslim Conference leader Raja Saqib Majeed clashed with the JKJAAC protesters who were gathered there.
The strike was announced last week, after JKJAAC-government negotiations remained deadlocked over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Witness accounts
Witnesses claimed that participants of the peace rally fired upon peaceful JKJAAC demonstrators “without any provocation”.
Ghulam Mustafa, a bystander, said one bullet hit Mohammad Sudheer, 30, who owned a crockery shop at Tahli Mandi Road. “By the time we reached CMH, he had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding,” he said.
An official at the Combined Military Hospital confirmed that Sudheer died during treatment.
Mohammad Basharat, 50, a shopkeeper in Shokat Lines, was wounded by shrapnel.
He claimed that demonstrators had tried to make space to let Mr Majeed’s convoy pass, but said that members of his posse came out of their vehicles and attacked them.
According to another eyewitness, the peace rally was protected by police and paramilitary troops. Police lobbed tear-gas shell on JAC demonstrators, and fired at them.
People at the hospital showed spent bullet casings, which they said they had collected them from the ground while trying to rescue injured people.
“When the action committee had already given a call for lockdown for Sept 29, why was Mr Majeed allowed to hold a so-called peace march on the same day?” questioned 20-year-old shopkeeper Raja Safeer, who was among those in the emergency ward.
Due to the communications blackout, neither local officials nor Mr Majeed could not be reached for comment.
Incidentally, some local media reports suggested that the peace rally had been fired upon by JAC protesters, but this could not be independently verified.
Another gathering today
Later in the evening, hundreds of people gathered at Muzafarrabad’s Lal Chowk, where JAC leaders including Shaukat Nawaz Mir delivered charged speeches.
Mr Mir alleged that some elements wanted to create a May 9-like situation in AJK for reasons best known to them, and urged the army chief to take stock of the situation.
Mr Mir called on the charged crowd to reassemble at the same spot at 11am today (Tuesday) for the next course of action.
All businesses and shops remained shuttered and street vendors away almost across the AJK, while roads also remained deserted.
Reports also suggested that similar gatherings were staged in Rawalakot and Sudhnoti, while in Bhimber, a rally was led by PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s brother, Ehsanul Haq, who is associated with the PTI.

In South Waziristan, police officials claimed to have killed a commander from the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Official said that Qari Hussain was killed in a firing incident in a remote part of Birmal Tehsil, Lower South Waziristan on Monday.
Police officials described the militant as a key figure in the TTP, having been involved in attacks on security forces, extortion, kidnapping, and targeted killings.
Separately, a militant was killed in a fierce clash with local police — who were backed by armed locals — in the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
A police official said that area police, with the help of armed villagers and members of the peace committee, launched an operation in the rural area on information about the presence of Fitna-al-Khwarij (the term used by the state to refer to TTP) terrorists there.
He said that an intense exchange of fire took place within the limits of Saddar police station wherein a terrorist was eliminated.
 
 

“The killed terrorist was identified as Hikmatullah, and he was wanted by police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in various terrorism-related cases”, he maintained.
Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan told Dawn that the Elite Force commandos, backed by armoured personnel carriers, also took part in the operation.
He said that police and people would jointly launch actions against the menace to eliminate it from the district completely.

• Jessica Courtney crash-landed near Rush Lake at 4,694m
• Army Aviation helicopter airlifts her to Gilgit, later to Skardu
GILGIT: An injured American paraglider was airlifted by a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter from Rush Lake, situated at an altitude of 4,694 metres in Nagar.
Two paragliders, Amer­ican national Jessica Courtney Green, 40, and Australian national Shane Owen Tighe, 35, had taken off from Karimabad, Hunza, on Saturday.
According to local police, both paragliders had planned to land at Rush Lake, about 50 kilometres from Karimabad. However, the American paraglider was forced to make a crash-landing. She sustained injuries to her leg, though her condition was initially stated to be stable.
Sources said she had also suffered broken ribs and an ankle injury and was found unconscious. Using a satellite phone, her fellow paraglider informed a friend about the situation, who then sought urgent rescue assistance from local people. Volunteers from Hop­er Valley reached the incident site on Sunday and managed to rescue the injured paraglider, taking her to some distance.
The volunteers stayed overnight in camp, providing food and first aid. On Monday morning, a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter airlifted the injured American paraglider to Gilgit and later to Skardu. From there, she was shifted to Islamabad on a chartered flight the same day.
Rush Lake is among the world’s highest alpine lakes, located about 15 km north of Miar Peak and Spantik. Tourists usually trek from Hoper Valley, crossing Hoper Glacier and Miar Glacier, to reach the site.
Rakaposhi expedition
Meanwhile, two Ameri­can climbers — Dane Christensen and Craig Orion Lutwyler — have begun an expedition to summit the 7788m Rakaposhi.
According to GB tourism department, both climbers have been issued permits. From Rakaposhi base camp, they started their climbing on Monday. They are being assisted by two local high-altitude porters. The American climbers plan to complete the mission in a month.

• Fodder shortages and rising disease risks reported

• Met Office forecasts rain, wind, thunderstorms in southeast Sindh till Oct 2
ISLAMABAD/LAH­O­RE: The Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) has warned that flood damages in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will affect upcoming Rabi cultivation, as the Punjab Provi­ncial Disaster Mana­g­em­ent Authority directed sur­vey teams to prioritise pub­lic complaints while ass­e­s­sing losses in affected areas.
Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has predicted rain, wind, and thundershowers in south-eastern Sindh till October 2, with occasional gaps.
The recent floods have damaged farmland, standing crops, and agricultural infrastructure in both Pun­jab and Khyber-Pakhtu­nkhwa.
In its preliminary asses­sment report on the impact of floods, released on Monday, the FAO warned that seed availability for Rabi 2025-26 and Kharif 2026 is under threat.
Floods inundated 1.3m hectares, including 0.93m hectares of cropland, with Punjab worst hit.
FAO said half of wheat seed comes from saved grain, much of which was lost in flooded homesteads.
Within the formal sector, 80 to 90 per cent of wheat seed is available, but market pressures may affect this supply. Rising demand and prices may push farmers to sell seed as grain, cutting availability across provinces.
The report said flooding cut fodder supplies, raising costs and limiting access in remote areas.
 
 

Many livestock owners are resorting to distress sales, and only 45 per cent of fodder seed is available in the formal market, heightening risks for livestock nutrition. Overcro­wded shelters and stagnant water are heightening stress and disease risks for livestock.
The FAO warned that conditions are favourable for outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD), foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and other zoonotic infections. LSD outbreaks have already been reported in southern Punjab bordering Sindh and Balochistan and are spreading northwards, with new cases in Pakp­attan, Lodhran and Khanewal.
Quantifying crop-wise damage in Punjab, the FAO report said: Rice: 188,837 hectares damaged (7.3pc of total rice area), mainly in the northeast. The worst-hit districts were Sialkot (37,944 ha, 24.67pc), Naro­wal (20,008 ha, 15.88pc), Gujranwala (10,765 ha, 4.72pc), Bahawalnagar (9,594 ha, 8.60pc) and She­ikh­upura (9,364 ha, 4.25pc).
Cotton: 84,182 hectares damaged (5.1pc of total cotton area). The worst-hit districts were Bahawalpur (19,503 ha, 6.10pc), Raja­npur (8,688 ha, 6.75pc), Khanewal (7,724 ha, 8.21pc), Multan (6,917 ha, 7.57pc) and Muzaffargarh (6,477 ha, 7.03pc).
Sugarcane: 23,413 hectares damaged (2.8pc of total sugarcane area). The most affected districts were Faisalabad (2,466 ha, 4.01pc), Jhang (2,254 ha, 4.05pc), Bhakkar (2,201 ha, 6.28pc), Rajanpur (1,512 ha, 2.87pc) and Layyah (1,504 ha, 5.45pc).
In KP, 62,080 hectares of land were flooded, including 50,821 hectares of cropland (2.7pc of total cropland). In Sindh, 74,542 hectares of land were flooded (0.5pc of total land), including 43,140 hectares of cropland (0.8pc of total cropland).
‘Focus on complaints’
In the meantime, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority has ordered survey teams to focus on addressing public complaints while conducting assessment of flood-damaged areas across the province.
In Jalalpur Pirwala, displaced people were asked to vacate schools being used as relief camps so classes could resume.
 
 

PDMA issued water-level data for all rivers in Punjab, showing normal flows and a significant decl­ine in flood-affected areas.
Separately, the PMD has predicted rain, wind, and thundershowers in south-eastern Sindh till October 2, with occasional gaps.
Aamir Yasin in Rawalpindi also contributed to this report.

Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chairs a meeting with the visiting IMF review mission at the Finance Division.—APP

ISLAMABAD: An Inter­n­ational Monetary Fund (IMF) mission led by Iva Petrova held a formal kick-off meeting with Pakistan’s economic team, headed by Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, to review the implementation of the $7bn Extended Financing Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience & Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The programme’s performance as of end-June 2025 — the period under review — has been mixed. The start of the next review period, ending December this year, has also been off the mark, particularly in revenue collection. The two sides now have to agree on corrective measures during their dialogue to meet the next biannual targets.
The opening session was attended by key economic stakeholders, including the State Bank of Pakistan governor, finance secretary and chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
 
 

While power sector benchmarks for the end-June 2025 period were comfortably met, revenue collection fell short by about Rs1.2 trillion — almost 1pc of GDP — in the last fiscal year, and the first two months of the current fiscal year have shown similar shortfalls.
The mission will remain in Pakistan for almost two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions with the authorities to push for faster implementation of the end-December 2025 targets.
Pakistan is also raising with the IMF a long-delayed implementation of the brownfield petroleum refinery policy, which has stalled about $6bn in fresh investment for refinery upgrades. Officials argue that this demand aligns with the RSF’s objectives because the upgrade would help produce petroleum products meeting European standards with minimal carbon and sulphur emissions.
 
 

The policy was announced about two years ago in consultation with the industry, which was in the process of signing binding contracts. However, under the IMF programme, the authorities committed not to grant any tax exemptions that had already been promised to refineries. As a result, although petroleum products are exempt from sales tax, the required equipment, materials and supplies are subject to sales tax and other duties without input-output adjustments, creating serious cash flow problems for the refineries.
The Petroleum Division has argued that existing refineries produce environmentally harmful by-products both during refining and consumption, posing health risks and worsening climate conditions.
Officials said that while the government has been seeking RSF funding for various projects, it has been losing out domestically due to obsolete refining technology because of what they termed a “technical misunderstanding” between the IMF, the Ministry of Finance and the FBR. “This is a simple distortion that can be addressed through reasonable dialogue,” one official said.
At the same time, while the government has asked the IMF to consider flood losses when assessing programme performance, sources said the review is based on pre-flood targets. Therefore, the authorities remain accountable for the end-June 2025 performance, although relaxations could be considered later based on verifiable estimates of flood damage.
FBR officials believe that their first-quarter revenue shortfall could be offset by higher inflation in the second quarter and improved recoveries from litigation cases that are in their final stages.
The government reportedly utilised one-third of the Rs390bn budget allocation for natural disasters and emergencies in 2025-26 to clear Rs130bn in past dues owed to commercial banks for incentives and fees paid for attracting remittances through banking channels. The authorities will now have to justify these payments from the emergency fund as they seek relaxations from the IMF over flood-related expenses. Moreover, the government has not allocated any funds in the current year’s budget for such incentives, despite estimating that about Rs100bn will be required for this purpose.
The sources said the authorities want the IMF to relax conditions for the primary budget surplus and fiscal deficit to create space for flood-related spending without imposing new taxes or cutting development expenditures.
The authorities have missed FBR revenue targets, as well as taxation targets for the retail sector and provincial cash surpluses for the end-June 2025 period, and could face a tough time during negotiations.
The government has also failed to publish the governance and corruption diagnostic report, which remains pending review and publication. As a result, the associated governance action plan is stalled. Similarly, the state-owned enterprises (SOE) governance-related law has not progressed in line with commitments made to the IMF.
Although the authorities successfully enacted agricultural income tax laws across all provinces on time, their implementation and collection — expected to begin in Sept-Oct — remain uncertain, particularly due to the ongoing floods in Punjab and Sindh. Consequently, the authorities are still unclear about the scale of required support for flood-affected populations, sectors and facilities.
On the positive side, Pakistan has met almost all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025. However, it is lagging behind in indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future programme implementation. Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.1bn RSF, the two sides will have to agree on past performance as well as forward-looking implementation plans.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) by the end of next month.

The agency aims to change the country’s disaster response from reactive to proactive, said Sup­arco’s member for tech­no­logy Zafar Iqbal at the la­­unch of the ‘Space-based Disaster Manage­ment — Shifting Focus from Rea­c­tive to Proactive Approa­c­hes’ training in Islamabad.
“These tools are used to enhance early warning sys­tems and support nati­onal policies and authorities on disaster preparedness as mitigation and ad­­aptation advance together as twin priorities,” Mr Iqbal said.
He stressed the importance of readiness before a crisis occurs.
“The challenge before us is not only to respond to disasters after they occur, but more importantly, to strengthen preparedness and resilience before they strike,” Mr Iqbal said. 
“By harnessing satellite data, remote sensing, and geospatial tools, we can mo­­nitor risks in advance, identify vulnerable areas, and support decision-makers with timely, actionable information.” He added that such strategies save lives, protect infrastructure and ensure that scarce resou­rces are deployed more effectively.

In less than two years, Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has killed at least 65,549 people and wounded 167,518, besides displacing millions from their areas. Earlier this month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
Trump announced Netanyahu’s agreement to his plan at a press conference in Washington, DC, ahead of which the White House had released Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza.
 






Addressing the press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”.

“The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were
with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a
statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They
back this 100 per cent.

“Things that have been going on for hundreds of years, thousands of years … at minimum, we are very, very close and beyond very close,” Trump said, thanking Netanyahu for his role in the peace process. “We worked well together, and have with many other countries, which is how this situation gets solved.”
Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip. He added that he and Netanyahu discussed issues like Iran, the Abraham Accords and ending the Gaza conflict.
“This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said.
 
  @dawn.today United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, is “very close” to agreeing on a deal to end the Gaza conflict. Addressing a press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They back this 100 per cent.” The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region.

“After extensive consultation with our friends and partners throughout the region, I am formally releasing our principles for peace,” Trump announced, adding that people “have really liked” them.
“These are done with total consideration and working with the nations we are talking about,” he added. “I want to thank the leaders of many Arab and Muslim nations for their tremendous support in developing the proposal, as well as our allies in Europe.
The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region.
“If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “The hostages are coming back.”
Trump said this means “an immediate end to the war itself”.
“Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations and we are relying on the countries we named and others  to deal with Hamas and I’m hearing Hamas wants to get this done too.”
‘New transitional authority’
Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip.
“Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases … no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated.
“Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do.
 


The US president emphasised that ultimately, the goal is to eliminate any danger in the reason, which he attributed to Hamas.
“To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself.
“We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.”
Trump said there would be more leaders and that their names would be announced in the coming days.
He added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”.
“Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.”
However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages.
“Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “The people of Israel want it (an end to the fighting).
“I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.”
‘Maybe, Iran can join the Abraham Accords’
Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords.
“They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords.
“This is the closest we’ve ever come to real peace.”
“The leaders discussed a proposal for ending the war in Gaza, prospects for a more secure Middle East, and the need for greater understanding between their countries,” the White House said before a news conference with Trump and the Israeli prime minister.
Trump added that Netanyahu expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call in the Oval Office.
“Bibi was talking to Prime Minister al-Thani of Qatar … they really had a heart-to-heart conversation,” the US president said. “We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.”
Trump said it was time for Hamas to accept the terms of the proposal, noting that with their leadership mostly killed during the Gaza conflict, Hamas were “not the same people” the US was dealing with.
“Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united and calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war and get us back our hostages right now and have everlasting peace,” Trump declared.
A new beginning for Gaza and the region: Netanyahu
Taking the floor, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his hospitality and for his friendship and leadership.
“While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better: ending wars and advancing peace,” the Israeli PM said.
“I believe that today, we are taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East and I think beyond the Middle East — very important Muslim countries.
“I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” Netanyahu said to Trump. “It will bring back to Israel all of our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities and its political rule and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”

Netanyahu added that the plan would not have been achieved without the “courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers”, calling the conflict “a war between civilisation and barbarism”.
“We are taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace,” he stated. “Your (Trump’s) plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas.
“Here’s our plan: all of our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarised. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas, or the Palestinian Authority.”
Netanyahu said that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the first step would be a “modest withdrawal” and the release of all hostages within 72 hours.
“The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza,” he added, expressing appreciation for Trump leading the body.
“If this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarisation, but will remain within the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.”
However, Netanyahu said that if Hamas rejects or violates the agreement, then Israel “will finish the job by itself”.
“This can be done the easy way … or the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.”
Netanyahu added that after Trump’s statement at the UN General Assembly, he was encouraged against recognising Palestine, stating that it would “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”.
“I appreciate your (Trump’s) firm position that the PA can have no role in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,” he stated.
Netanyahu said that there needs to be a fundamental change, which would include ending “pay-to-slay”, changing Palestinian textbooks that “teach hatred [of] Jews”, ending “lawfare” at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and stopping incitement in the media among “many, many other reforms”.
He added that Trump’s proposal presents a “practical and realistic path forward” in which Gaza would be administered by “those committed to genuine peace with Israel”.
“I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza [but] a new beginning for the entire region,” the Israeli PM said, adding that the plan could reenergise the Abraham Accords.
PM Shehbaz welcomes Gaza plan
Earlier, PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that he welcomed Trump’s plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end.
His statement came as the US president greeted Netanyahu at the White House for talks on the US-led peace plan. Before the meeting, Trump had told reporters he was “very confident” that there would be peace in Gaza.
 






Asked if all parties were on board with his 21-point plan, he repeated, “very confident”.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz posted on X: “I welcome President Trump’s 20-point [sic] plan to ensure an end to the war in Gaza.
“I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,” the PM wrote.
He added, “It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality.”
PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict”.
“I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added.
Earlier in the day, he also spoke to Pakistani journalists in London, where he spoke about Trump’s meeting with Muslims leaders on Gaza in New York last week.
The meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia, who discussed Trump’s proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
During his interaction with journalists in London today, PM Shehbaz “a very constructive discussion took place” at the meeting. He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.”

The step signals Trump’s willingness to extend protectionist trade policies into cultural industries, raising uncertainty for studios that depend heavily on cross-border co-productions and international box-office revenue.
“Our movie-making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing candy from a baby,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social.
However, it was not immediately clear what legal authority Trump would use to impose a 100pc tariff on foreign-made films.
The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on how the tariffs would be implemented.
Top US studios Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Skydance and Netflix also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast declined to comment.
“There is too much uncertainty, and this latest move raises more questions than answers,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore.
“For now, as things stand, costs are likely to increase, and this will inevitably be passed on to consumers,” he said.
The president had first floated the idea of a movie tariff in May but offered few details, leaving entertainment executives unsure whether it would apply to specific countries or all imports.
 
 

After the announcement in May, a coalition of American film unions and guilds sent a letter to Trump, urging him to support tax incentives for domestic film production in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress, aiming to help return more movie and television projects to the US.
The US film industry recorded a $15.3 billion trade surplus in 2023, backed by $22.6bn in exports to international markets, according to the Motion Picture Association.
From Australia to Canada
Studio executives told Reuters earlier this year that they were “flummoxed” by how a movie tariff might be enforced, given that modern films often use production, financing, post-production and visual effects spread across multiple countries.
Hollywood has increasingly relied on overseas production hubs such as Canada, the UK and Australia, where tax incentives have attracted big-budget shoots for films ranging from superhero blockbusters to streaming dramas.
At the same time, co-productions with foreign studios have become more common, particularly in Asia and Europe, where local partners provide financing, access to markets, and distribution networks.
Industry executives also warn that a broad tariff could affect the thousands of US workers employed on overseas shoots, from visual effects artists to production crews, whose work is often coordinated across multiple countries.</p><small>2025-09-29 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29210907c1e7f5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945468/pakistani-imprisoned-in-india-repatriated-via-attari-wagah-border' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani imprisoned in India repatriated via Attari-Wagah border</strong></a><br><p>Raqib Bilal, a Pakistani national imprisoned in India, was repatriated via the Attari-Wagah border on Monday, according to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
“Consistent with the vision of the government, [the high commission] will continue to make every effort for the repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails,” the high commission wrote in a post on X.
 






Dawn.com approached Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan for comment and he confirmed the development, stating that a Pakistani national imprisoned in India has been released.
In July, the foreign ministries of Islamabad and New Delhi exchanged lists detailing the number of prisoners held in each other’s countries.
According to a statement from the FO, “The government of Pakistan handed over a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners (53 civilian prisoners and 193 fishermen) to a representative of the Indian High Commission, Islamabad.
“Simultaneously, the government of India shared a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners (382 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) to a diplomat from the High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi.”
 






As many as 23,456 Pakistanis are currently behind bars overseas, with the largest number of inmates, 12,156, being held in Saudi Arabia, the FO informed the National Assembly in May.</p><small>2025-09-29 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/292030439b592b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945463/it-is-punjabs-water-maryam-resurrects-cholistan-canals-issue-amid-rift-with-ppp' target='_blank'><strong>‘It is Punjab’s water’: Maryam resurrects Cholistan canals issue amid rift with PPP</strong></a><br><p>In her latest censure of the PPP, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday resurrected the issue of the contentious Cholistan canals project, saying the water that would have been diverted towards the desert belonged to her province.
“If Punjab wants construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad.
“If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre.
The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively.
The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab.
Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had inaugurated the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share.
After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh, the federal government had announced on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces.
As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of dispute between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief.
The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition.
Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab.
“Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution.
“Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.</p><small>2025-09-29 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29173045c71051e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945431/pm-defends-trumps-nobel-prize-nomination-credits-him-for-easing-regional-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>PM defends Trump’s Nobel Prize nomination, credits him for easing regional tensions</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation.
The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation.
Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations.
Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.”
He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.”
The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.”
‘Washington visit very fruitful’
Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.”
He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia.
“There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said.
“Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Conflict with India
PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan.
“[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said.
“I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces.
“And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.”
2025 floods
The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll.
He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
“Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said.
“In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred.
“But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-29 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29190531dcfe655.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945454/na-passes-resolution-condemning-alleged-verbal-abuse-of-senior-journalist-by-pti-founder' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes resolution condemning alleged verbal abuse of senior journalist by PTI founder</strong></a><br><p>Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) on Monday staged a mass walkout from a session of the National Assembly, over senior journalist Ijaz Ahmed allegedly being subjected to misbehaviour by PTI founder Imran Khan.
According to Ahmed, who spoke to Dawn.com, the walkout was organised by the PRA Pakistan’s Election Committee.
“[The] PTI founder hurled abuse at me for asking questions,” Ahmed said.
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq directed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to hold talks with PRA. During the walkout, the speaker noted that the PRA submitted a written complaint over the issue, which Tarar spoke about during his address.
 


Later, the National Assembly released visuals of Ahmed meeting with Speaker Sadiq in his office.
 






“It is your (reporters) right to protest and politics and journalism have a deep relationship,” the minister said, requesting that the reporters listen to what he has to say. “You have a valid complaint.”
“A senior member of the PRA was involved in a verbal altercation at Adiala Jail with a senior leader who hurled foul language at him,” the law minister stated, not mentioning the PTI founder by name.
“It is the job of reporters and journalists to criticise us and show us our reflection in the mirror. We should take this criticism to heart and not silence or attack them.”
Tarar said that Ahmed requested the speaker’s office for permission to speak with Imran at Adiala and requested protection.
“After the discussion and the way he (Ahmed) was abused, there was a social media onslaught targeting him,” Tarar added. “Posts said ‘Look at this man’s face’, ‘don’t forgive him’ and ‘look what he said about our Quaid’.
“This is a distinguished House and I must request that we behave democratically,” he said. “We need to prove through our own attitudes that we listen to other people and that there is room for decency and politics in this House.”
PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri noted in her address that Ahmed is a renowned journalist in Islamabad and has links to Sindh.
“In terms of his reporting, he is a decent journalist,” she said. “We may have differences of opinion, but in terms of his reporting and ethics, he is commendable.”
Marri added that journalists expose problems plaguing the country and face issues while doing so. She also condemned people posting Ahmed’s face on social media and “making him a target of hate”.
“We keep saying that they criticise politicians, but we criticise each other for not protecting journalists. Why do we forget to offer them protection?”
After a recess, Ahmed himself spoke on the floor of the House and said that he had gone to Adiala Jail on the speaker’s request and heard from Khan about his treatment at Adiala Jail.
“We told him that we would speak about this on the floor of the House,” Ahmed said.
“He (Imran) had two demands: the first being that Ahmed speak about how no PTI members were part of an opposition delegation to visit him in jail. The other was that he wanted a resolution passed about this incident.”
Imran also demanded that the Sindh government launch a “high-level investigation” into the murder of anchorperson Imtiaz Mir.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) MNA Syed Aminul Haque, who was a part of the delegation, alleged that Imran hurled threats and foul language at Ahmed.
 


“Immediately afterwards, we saw him being trolled on social and digital media,” Haque said, adding that the MQM condemned the incident. “People were trying to get his address and threaten his family. Journalists have a right to ask questions. People are free not to answer, but to threaten them and be rude is undemocratic.”
A resolution was presented before the House condemning the verbal altercation and stating that not only did Imran use harsh language, but also launched a social media campaign against Ahmed and other senior journalists.
It demanded that Ahmed and other journalists receive immediate protection, legal action be taken against those responsible and also condemned Mir’s murder in Karachi, demanding an investigation into the shooting.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”.
“We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan sahib, so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people.
“A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.”
The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House.
“If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed.
Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media.
“We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p><small>2025-09-29 15:04</small></div><hr>
