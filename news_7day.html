Terrorists were provided “safe havens” and places to run training camps in Afghanistan, he said while responding to a question during a press conference in Islamabad.
He highlighted that many among the recently killed terrorists were from Afghanistan.
The CM called on the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan to abide by the Doha agreement, in which “you committed not to let your soil be used against any country”.
Bugti’s statement is the latest in repeated blames by Islamabad of terror outfits using Afghan soil to carry out attack in Pakistan. Islamabad has also urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring terrorists. But, Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
Bugti justifies 4G suspension
Earlier in the press conference, he shared details of a intelligence-based operation conducted in Chagai yesterday, in which he two men were killed and another surrendered. He said one of the two killed “terrorists” was a lawyer by profession.
He detailed that the lawyer was traced following some arrests over the killing of Pakistan Air Force men on May 8 in Dal Badin. “We observed him for two to three months, and yesterday surrounded his house. Then, through a loud speaker, we asked him to surrender, and as soon as we did that, firing started from their end.”
A Federal Constabulary soldier was martyred, and retaliatory firing by security personnel led to a fire exchange which went on for two to three hours, he said, adding that eventually two of the “terrorists” were killed and their third companion surrendered.
Answering a question, he said efforts were being made to gather terrorist organisations in Balochistan. He went on to say that this was “war” facilitated and funded by Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. “They have foisted an intelligence-based war on us, and they are trying to bring together all those who want to destabilise Pakistan.”
Bugti also touched upon the suspension of 4G mobile network services in Balochistan.
“We faced criticism for suspending 4G services,” he said, clarifying that the authorities’ intention behind such moves was not to cause inconvenience for the people. “But, terrorists have started using means of communication that are beyond the capacity of our intelligence agencies,” he explained, adding that the suspension of mobile network services helped with tracking down and catching terrorists.
In response to another questioned, he stressed the need to distinguish between the “youth” who had not taken up arms and those who had  taken up arms with the intention to break Pakistan.
He questioned if an area was deprived of development and resources, should its people kill others. “How are you justifying violence on this basis? … We continue to link this violence to deprivation, unparalleled development, [violation of] human rights.”
Balochistan, where violence has been a problem for long, continues to face neglect in terms of development and resource availability as well. Human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, have also repeatedly called out the authorities over action against rights activists, notably Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s Mahrang Baloch. Mahrang has particularly raised voice over the issue of missing persons.
Bugti also directed criticism toward her and said “there is a huge difference between self-disappearance and enforced disappearance”.
“Unfortunately, you continue to buy the narrative being peddled out here, without thinking that the reality may be different from perception,” he continued.
He also dispelled the impression that there “is a puppet government in Balochistan”.
The CM also shared that the federal and Balochistan government had decided to carry out an exercise with the help of satellite images and would not get Pakistan’s poppy-free status get compromised.
He was also asked about the reports of killing of a terrorist identified as Rehman Gul in Afghanistan, who is said to be the mastermind of the Jaffer Express attack.
CM Bugti said these were unconfirmed reports. “It cannot be said that this is 100 per cent true. This is what we have been informed of from different sources … But I believe that this is a big success of ours, even if the reports are unconfirmed. Though, it seems they will be confirmed soon.”</p><small>2025-09-25 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2517043834a7c9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944552/6-journalists-including-lahore-press-club-president-approach-lhc-against-nccia-notices' target='_blank'><strong>6 journalists, including Lahore Press Club president, approach LHC against NCCIA notices</strong></a><br><p>Six journalists, including Lahore Press Club President Muhammad Arshad Ansari, approached the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday to challenge notices issued by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, named the NCCIA director, deputy director and inspector from Lahore as well as the director general from Islamabad as respondents in the case.
The petitioners were named as Ansari, Sheikh Mujahid Latif, Sheraz Nisar, Ahmed Faraz, Yasir Shamoon and Waseem Sabir.
 
 

According to the petition, the journalists’ professional duty was to cover criminal cases and highlight issues and defects in the police administration. Further, it said that the petitioners had criticised the formation of the Crime Control Department, the appointment of Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Faisal Kamran without merit and the increasing crime rate in Lahore.
The journalists contended that this prompted DIG Kamran to “launch malicious social media campaigns against petitioners through retired police officials”.
It stated that on September 18, a “premeditated complaint based on false and fabricated contents” was submitted to the NCCIA to “defame” the petitioners. It said that later first and second notices were issued by the NCCIA deputy director to the journalists for personal appearance.
The petitioners argued that the first notice was issued on September 20 and the second on September 24, with a directive to appear the very next day on September 25.
“The gap between both notices is three to four days, which shows misuse of power/authority just to malign [the] petitioners,” the petition said.
“Powers are being misused by [the] respondents [and] notices are being sent, maliciously motivated by [the] desires of others just to malign journalists,” the petition added.
“[These] notices are illegal and unlawful [and] no rules have been made yet for [the] check and balance of [the] notices mechanism with [a] duration or gap between notices. Serving Notices at [the] desire of higher authorities to malign journalists is clearly mala fide [on the] part of [the] investigating officer,” said.
The petitioners requested that the LHC quash the NCCIA’s initial September 18 notice as it was “illegal, unlawful and void ab initio”. They also called on the court to suspend the operation of the September 18 notice till the petition was decided.</p><small>2025-09-25 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/251142064ed96fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944526/pm-shehbaz-to-meet-trump-at-white-house-today' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to meet Trump at White House today</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump will meet Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later today at the White House in the Oval Office, according to the president’s official schedule of daily engagements.
The meeting is expected to take place at 4:30pm in Washington, around 1:30 am (PST) on Friday.
Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is expected to accompany the premier, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will join President Trump.
A Trump administration official also confirmed the meeting between PM Shehbaz and Trump, which comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal, to Reuters.
According to Radio Pakistan, the two are “expected to discuss matters of mutual interest as well as regional and global situation”.
The development comes as the premier travelled to the US for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. During his whirlwind tour, PM Shehbaz has attended UNGA sessions, a key multilateral summit of the Muslim bloc, as well as side meetings with the heads of international financial institutions in New York.
After the meeting with Trump, the premier is expected to return to New York as he is expected to address the UNGA on Friday.
At a media briefing in New York, a senior State Department official told Dawn that ties between Washington and Islamabad were “gradually warming up” in Trump’s second term.
For years, the United States had viewed India as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in Asia, while Pakistan was seen as a close Chinese ally.
Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, US relations with India have come under strain over visa hurdles for Indians, steep tariffs imposed by Washington on Indian goods, and the president’s repeated claim that he personally brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May following cross-border hostilities.
The senior official emphasised that US relations with Pakistan were not tied to its partnership with India.
“We have an independent relationship with Pakistan,” he said, recalling recent American investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Pakistan’s mineral sector, and noting continued US interest in petroleum exploration.
Responding to a question, the official added that Washington was still reviewing the recently concluded defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
On July 31, the two countries announced a trade agreement under which the US imposed a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods. Trump has yet to finalise a similar deal with India. Analysts note that in response to tensions with Washington, New Delhi has begun recalibrating its ties with China as a hedge.
Earlier this year, Trump welcomed Field Marshal Munir to the White House — the first time a US president hosted Pakistan’s military leader without senior civilian officials present. Munir is widely regarded as the most powerful figure in the country, and his reception at the Oval Office underscored the military’s central role in bilateral relations.
“We’re working through a number of issues when it comes to counterterrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” the senior State Department official said when asked about Pakistan.
“And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.”
On India, the official said Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in the relationship but still considered it strong. Washington, he added, continued to see New Delhi as “a good friend and partner” whose ties with the US would “define the 21st century”.
Islamabad has publicly backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to defuse tensions with India, even as it has condemned Israeli bombardments in Gaza, Qatar and Iran.
Prime Minister Sharif also joined Trump on Tuesday in a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries, where the US president discussed Israel’s assault on Gaza and shared American peace proposals on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
PM Shehbaz meets Bangladesh’s Yunus
PM Shehbaz also met Bangladesh’s chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus, in New York today, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.
In this meeting, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening “constructive and forward-looking ties” with Bangladesh, rooted in mutual respect, trust and shared aspirations of regional peace and prosperity, the Radio Pakistan report said.
The two leaders reviewed the current state of Pakistan-Bangladesh bilateral relations, discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in areas including trade, regional connectivity and people-to-people exchanges, it added.
For his part, Yunus appreciated Pakistan’s initiative to deepen engagement and highlighted the importance of enhancing bilateral trade and cultural linkage, it said.

“Teen accounts are already rolled out globally on Instagram, and now Meta is extending the same protections to teens worldwide on Facebook and Messenger,” Meta said in a statement.
Teen accounts were introduced by Meta a year ago, which, according to the statement, was “a significant step to keep teens safe across Meta’s apps”.
“Since then, hundreds of millions of teens have already been placed into Teen Accounts across Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.”
The statement added: “Teen Account protections were designed to address parents’ top concerns with automatic safeguards that limit who teens can interact with, filter the content they see, and ensure their time online is well spent.”
While there’s always more work to be done, Meta says it is “encouraged to see that Teen Accounts are bringing parents more peace of mind when it comes to their teens’ online experiences.”
“As part of Meta’s commitment to supporting parents and protecting teens, the organisation is always working on new ways to keep teens safe on their apps,” per the statement.
Last month, Reuters reported that Meta’s AI rules have let bots hold sensual chats with kids as well as offer false medical information.
Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has also said that Meta Platforms would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build “several massive AI data centres for superintelligence,” intensifying pursuit of a technology Zuckerberg has chased with a talent war for top engineers.</p><small>2025-09-25 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25150816c01f0d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944542/bisp-sole-method-of-providing-immediate-relief-to-flood-victims-bilawal-asserts' target='_blank'><strong>BISP sole method of providing immediate relief to flood victims, Bilawal asserts</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country.
Bilawal’s statement comes as a war of words between coalition partners PML-N and PPP escalated on Wednesday after the former questioned the transparency of the BISP, while the latter accused its senior partner of showing an “irresponsible attitude” by refusing to use the programme’s data to compensate flood-affected people in Punjab.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he said: “Across the country, the agriculture sector was already struggling but after the floods, it has been badly affected. Our national food security may also be at risk.
“I had appealed to the federal government to declare a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency to address the losses caused by the floods,” he said. He added that he had also called for the power bills of farmers in affected districts to also be waived.
He appreciated the federal government and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for following through on his requests.
Talking about the Sindh government, he said that he had spoken to the Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah about ways to support small farmers and landowners.
He said that through the Benazir Hari Card, the provincial government would support small farmers who owned between one and 25 acres of land. He added that the Sindh government would also support farmers with fertiliser.
“Our effort is to support the wheat crop so that we do not need to import wheat,” he said.
“If provincial and federal governments take timely action, we can not only mitigate the losses from this flood but also avoid a heavy import bill. It is better to spend our resources on our own farmers and agriculture sector so that Pakistan’s economy can reach a position where we export instead of importing.”
Bilawal highlighted that the affects of the floods were ongoing. He said that while it had impacted the low-lying areas of Sindh, “the scale of loss in Punjab, especially south Punjab, is historic“.
“While it is very important to consider what you will do going forward, the most important thing is what you are doing today,” he said. Therefore, the support provided by the provincial government will be amplified if the BISP is used to reach those areas that are still underwater.
“A natural calamity is not the responsibility of any one province; across the world, the federal government plays the leading role. It is also the responsibility of the federal government to deliver relief to the affected people through BISP,” he said.
He said that while the most damage had been sustained by Punjab, it should not be forgotten that Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had also suffered.
“So BISP is the sole method through which the federal government can provide immediate relief to the affected people. This has been the standard practice,” he said, adding that the Centre had done the same in the past and during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“If we don’t do this today, I must ask: what is the fault of the people of South Punjab when they face such devastating floods, their homes are destroyed, and they are living on the road?” he said, calling on the federal government to “review its policy”.
He further said the federal government should have sought international help from the outset.
“When the floods began, the federal government should not have waited for any provincial help. It should have issued an international appeal immediately. I am not criticising […] but if you are spending Rs100 rupees, you could have spent Rs200; if you were helping 100 people, you could have helped 200,” he said.
“By talking to the international community, by seeking a review of International Monetary Fund (IMF) restrictions, your hand would have been stronger, if you had made a timely global appeal as you did previously. This time it should have happened, and it did not,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-25 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25144415326b11c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944545/security-tight-after-deadly-ladakh-autonomy-protests-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Security tight after deadly Ladakh autonomy protests in India</strong></a><br><p>Indian police patrolled the northern city of Leh on Thursday, a day after protests demanding greater autonomy for India-held Ladakh turned deadly when security forces opened fire.
At least five people were killed, 30 police officers were injured and several more protesters wounded.
The city — usually bustling with tourists — appeared deserted, with most main roads blocked by coils of razor wire and guarded by police in riot gear, an AFP reporter said.
Protests erupted on Wednesday, with crowds demanding greater autonomy in the sparsely populated, high-altitude desert region that is home to some 300,000 people and which borders China and Pakistan.
India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said that an “unruly mob” had attacked police, reporting in a statement issued late on Wednesday that “more than 30” officers were injured.
Protesters torched a police vehicle and the offices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while officers fired tear gas and used batons to disperse crowds.
“In self-defence, police had to resort to firing, in which unfortunately some casualties are reported,” the statement said.
It did not give any details about deaths.
However, a police officer told AFP that “five deaths were reported after the protests”. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to journalists. He said the “number of injured is in the dozens”.
A police unit guarded the vandalised BJP office on Thursday, alongside the wreckage of a burned armoured vehicle.
Around half of Ladakh’s residents are Muslim and about 40 per cent are Buddhist.
It is classed as a “Union Territory” — meaning it elects lawmakers to India’s parliament but is governed directly by New Delhi.
Wednesday’s demonstrations were organised in solidarity with prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk, who had been on hunger strike demanding either full federal statehood for Ladakh or constitutional protections for its tribal communities, land and fragile environment.
 
 

New Delhi said the protesters were “instigated by his provocative speeches” and pointed out that efforts were continuing to discuss its governance.
Modi’s government split Ladakh off from India-occupied Kashmir in 2019, imposing direct rule on both. New Delhi has yet to fulfil its promise to include Ladakh in the “Sixth Schedule” of India’s constitution, which allows people to make their own laws and policies.
Omar Abdullah, chief minister of India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, said people in Ladakh felt “betrayed and angry”.
India’s army maintains a large presence in Ladakh, which includes disputed border areas with China. Troops from the two countries clashed there in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.</p><small>2025-09-25 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25141357cd874be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944525/gb-traders-reject-agreement-reached-with-federal-govt-to-continue-protest-at-sost-dry-port' target='_blank'><strong>GB traders reject agreement reached with federal govt, to continue protest at Sost Dry Port</strong></a><br><p>Traders in Gilgit-Baltistan have decided to continue their sit-in despite the government agreeing to conditionally exempt imports routed through the Sost Dry Port from key federal taxes, trade leader Javed Hussain — who has been leading the protest — told Dawn.com on Thursday.
Local traders in GB have been staging a protest sit-in, blocking the port since July. The protest was launched against the government’s taxation policies and suspension of customs clearance at the port.
Yesterday, the government agreed to tax exemptions on imports coming through the port — provided that the goods were for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions. The total annual value of tax exemptions was capped at Rs4 billion.
This was announced after talks between the federal government, GB government and local business leaders in Islamabad.
But, Hussain said traders were not satisfied with this agreement.
“After the agreement and its announcement in Islamabad, it was suggested to us to end the protest. But we don’t agree with this [suggestion] and have decided to continue the sit-in and keep the trade suspended,” he said.
Hussain said traders would now have a sitting with its representative body that held talks with the government. If its members were able to give a satisfactory justification regarding yesterday’s agreement, traders would deliberate on whether to continue the protest, he added.
“Setting a limit on imports and placing a cap of Rs4bn goes against our demands,” he asserted, adding that traders’ demands were based on GB’s “legal status” in the country and the “exemption it was provided under the Constitution”.
But the decision made in Islamabad is contrary to this, and “we are of the view that by setting a limit on imports, decision-makers have [failed to resolve] the fundamental dispute”, he said.
Hussain also pointed out that a statutory regulatory order (SRO) had not been issued so far and only an agreement was finalised. “We are carefully reviewing the provisions of this agreement,” he added.
Reiterating the traders were not satisfied with the agreement, he said they could go for a “Plan C”.
He added that they would also consult the stakeholders and discuss the shortcomings of the agreement, after which they would consider ending the protest.
The trade leader also raised the questioned that why “dozens of containers that were stuck for several months” were not being given clearance through an SRO and other procedures were being opted for, for this purpose.</p><small>2025-09-25 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2513374375f6c4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944535/aurangzeb-terms-rs12tr-circular-debt-deal-largest-financing-in-pakistans-history' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb terms Rs1.2tr circular debt deal ‘largest financing’ in Pakistan’s history</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has hailed the Rs1.2 trillion bank loan secured to settle Pakistan’s circular debt as the “largest financing and largest restructuring transaction” in the country’s history.
On Wednesday, the government signed loan facilities worth approximately Rs1.225tr with 18 banks to settle the outstanding dues of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) parked in circular debt. These dues will be serviced through a Rs3.23 per unit surcharge on consumers for a period of six years.
The signing ceremony was held at the PM Office, witnessed virtually by the prime minister from New York. No official announcement was made, although ministers confirmed the signing of the agreement. Under the agreement, the government will have 30 days to request disbursements from banks for prompt utilisation to avoid penalties.
Today, the ceremony was aired on television, with both the premier and the finance minister addressing the gathering.
In his remarks, Aurangzeb said that facility “resolves the structural issues of the power sector”.
“Ultimately, it’s all for the benefit of Pakistan and the benefit of the consumers,” he said, branding it a “win-win situation”.
 
 

Lauding the efforts of the authorities involved in arranging the loan facility, the finance minister remarked, “This is a very important step in reducing the energy equation.”
Echoing the minister’s thoughts, PM Shehbaz termed the facility a “huge success”, remarking that “circular debt was eating up all our resources”.
The premier noted that negotiating with IPPs was a “big challenge”, but the team “lived up to their responsibility at the right time.”
He also thanked Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for his “behind-the-scenes support”. Outlining future steps, PM Shehbaz said that the power sector’s next targets included privatisation of power distribution companies and dealing with line losses.
 
 

“These are big challenges that we have to take on with faith,” he added.
Speaking at the ceremony, Power Minister Awais Leghari called the move a “bold step”, pointing out that “circular debt has burdened the energy sector for a long time”.
“The circular debt financing scheme is another landmark initiative to restore the health of our power sector,” Leghari added.
‘A major breakthrough’
Separately, in a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday, Aurangzeb called the agreement a step towards “restoring fiscal discipline, investor confidence, and energy sector sustainability”.
The success of the agreement “sets a precedent for addressing Pakistan’s structural challenges with innovation, unity and resolve,” the press release quoted him as saying.
The finance minister, in the statement, maintained that “release of Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees through this arrangement will channel much-needed liquidity into priority sectors such as agriculture, small and medium enterprises, housing, education, and healthcare”.
In its statement, the ministry hailed the “historic joint effort”, calling it a “major breakthrough in addressing one of the most chronic challenges of Pakistan’s energy sector”.
Under the facility, the servicing of the Rs1.225tr debt would be serviced through a Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) at the rate of Rs3.23 per unit. Of this, Rs659bn would be used for loans payable by Power Holding Ltd (PHL) — a shell subsidiary of the Power Division.
The remaining funds — 556bn — would be used to pay dues to IPPs, petroleum sector entities, and make subsidy adjustments, including through book adjustments and cash settlements.
The Ministry of Finance facilitated the loan agreements with 18 banks, including Habib Bank, Meezan Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, Allied Bank Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Faysal Bank Ltd, Bank Al Habib Ltd, MCB Bank Ltd, Bank Alfalah, Dubai Islamic Bank, Bank of Punjab, BankIslami Pakistan, Askari Bank Ltd, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Al Baraka Bank Ltd, Bank of Khyber, MCB Islamic Bank and Soneri Bank.
Amid little reform and a stock of over Rs4.6tr circular debt, Pakistan’s energy sector continues to weigh heavily on its economy across all sectors, owing to weak collections, theft, poor infrastructure, governance problems, and market inefficiencies.
According to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF), “there is about 4pc of GDP worth of debt stemming from the energy sector. The repercussion of this debt reverberates throughout the economy, not only impacting the fiscal but also growth, inflation, the external balance, and the financial sector.”
It said circular debt and energy subsidies added significant pressure to public finances, contributing to persistent fiscal imbalances and forcing the government to allocate resources away from other investments, social programmes, and infrastructure projects, and crowding out the private sector.</p><small>2025-09-25 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25125747d07f4d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944530/india-skipper-suryakumar-in-hot-water-as-icc-orders-probe-into-remarks-after-asia-cup-win-over-pakistan-report' target='_blank'><strong>India skipper Suryakumar in hot water as ICC orders probe into remarks after Asia Cup win over Pakistan: report</strong></a><br><p>India skipper Suryakumar Yadav is facing controversy after the International Cricket Council (ICC) acknowledged remarks he made following India’s Asia Cup group-stage victory over Pakistan on September 14, saying that it is reviewing a complaint lodged by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and may proceed with a formal hearing, Hindustan Times reported on Thursday.
The move comes after the PCB lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
The ICC confirmed that it is reviewing a complaint filed by the PCB, and a formal hearing may be initiated, as per Hindustan Times.
Speaking during the presentation ceremony after the match, Yadav had said that he wanted to “dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery”.
“Hope they continue to inspire us all, and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to make them smile.”
The PCB alleged that Suryakumar’s comments were “political”.
Citing a Dainik Jagran report, Hindustan Times reported that match referee Richie Richardson sent an email to the Indian team management in which he acknowledged receiving two official reports from the PCB regarding Suryakumar’s post-match presentation speech and press conference remarks.
Moreover, according to ESPNcricinfo, the captains did not shake hands at the toss, the players did not greet each other after the match, and “handshakegate” has continued to be a subject of talk and debate at the Asia Cup ever since.
In a subsequent rematch between the two countries on Sunday, India secured a six-wicket win, chasing down the 172-run target with ease in Dubai. However, Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan has said his team is confident that it would face “India again in the final” of the men’s Asia Cup. The opener made the remark while speaking at a pre-match press conference on Monday, before Pakistan’s clash with Sri Lanka a day later.</p><small>2025-09-25 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25125918aa341dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944534/constable-martyred-by-unknown-assailants-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Constable martyred by unknown assailants in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>A police constable was shot dead by unknown assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Thursday morning, police said.
Bannu’s District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Bacha Khan Chowk area of the district’s Domel tehsil.
“The police constable was on his way to arrive for duty when unknown armed motorcyclists opened fire on him,” Kulachi said.
The DPO added that the constable, Qadus Khan, was critically injured and taken to the Khaleefa Gul Nawaz (KGN) hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.
The spokesperson for the Bannu regional police, Khanzala Quraishi, told Dawn.com that the constable was the guard of the Wazir sub-divisional police officer.
“After the incident, the station house officer of the Domel area went to the crime scene along with a team to investigate the incident,” Qureshi said.
DPO Kulachi, meanwhile, said that an operation against the ‘terrorists’ was underway in various locations of the district to eliminate the threat from the area.
He added that the funeral of the martyred police constable would be conducted later today.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
Earlier this month, a police constable was martyred and ano­t­her seriously injured in a confrontation with three alleged terrorists at a police post in the Patesi Adda area of Mir Ali Tehsil, in the third attack on police personnel in the Bannu division that same week.
Meanwhile, in August, at least three Frontier Corps personnel and two policemen were martyred in separate incidents in Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa’s Upper Dir, Kohat, and Mohmand districts.</p><small>2025-09-25 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25114421c6e06ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944528/pakistan-calls-for-ai-to-be-regulated-under-un-charter-warns-against-military-application' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for AI to be regulated under UN charter, warns against military application</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be regulated by the United Nations charter, particularly its military use, warning that “AI must not become a tool of coercion.”
As artificial intelligence advances without meaningful checks, Pakistan’s call at the UN reflects wider concerns voiced by developing nations that powerful states will shape the rules to their advantage.
Earlier this year, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution urging inclusive and equitable AI governance that bridges the digital divide, while countries in the Global South, from Indonesia to Brazil, have warned that unchecked deployment risks deepening inequalities.
Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, while speaking at a high-level debate on AI under the agenda item ‘Maintenance of international peace and security’ during the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session in New York, highlighted AI’s potential for misuse and called for the UN Charter and international law to “fully govern the development and use of AI applications”.
”AI must not become a tool of coercion, or technological monopoly,“ the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted him as saying.
The APP reported that the meeting was chaired by South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung, as the country holds the 15-member Council’s presidency for September.
Warning against AI’s military applications, the minister stressed that while AI may be the “most consequential, dual-use technology,” it also has the potential to deepen “inequalities, and destabilizing international order.”
 
 

“Applications, without meaningful human control, should be prohibited,” he added while addressing the 15-member council.
Noting the perils of unregulated AI, Asif pointed out that, “Unregulated and irresponsible use of AI enables disinformation campaigns, offensive cyber operations, and development of new types of armaments.“
“The accelerating weaponisation of AI, through autonomous weapon systems, and AI-driven command and control systems, poses a grave danger.”
He urged the states to “commit to measures that prevent destabilising use, and pre-emptive incentives.”
 
 

Referring to the four-day military standoff between India and Pakistan in May, Asif noted that during the conflict, “autonomous munitions and high-speed dual-capable cruise missiles were used by one nuclear-armed state against another during a military exchange,” cautioning that the instance demonstrates the “dangers that AI can pose.”
Warning against the changing future of warfare, he said, “AI lowers the threshold for use of force, making wars more politically and operationally feasible.”
AI “compresses decision-time, narrowing the window for diplomacy and de-escalation,” the minister cautioned, adding that AI also “blurs domain boundaries, merging cyber, kinetic, and informational effects in unpredictable ways.”
He called for AI use to promote “peace and development” rather than “conflict and instability.”
“Let us preserve the primacy of human judgment, in matters of war and peace, ensuring that, even in an age of intelligent machines, innovation is guided by principles of morality and humanity,“ Asif said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who opened the debate, while highlighting the many uses of AI along the lines of food insecurity, de-mining, and violence outbreaks, cautioned that, “Without guardrails, it can also be weaponised.“
AI is “no longer a distant horizon — it is here, transforming daily life, the information space and the global economy at breathtaking speed,“ he said; however, “innovation must serve humanity — not undermine it.”
Recalling the establishment of the UN’s Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and a Global Dialogue on AI Governance, Guterres remarked, “humanity’s fate cannot be left to an algorithm” as “humans must always retain authority over life-and-death decisions”.
On that note, he called on the council and the member states to “ensure that human control and judgment are preserved in every use of force,” APP quoted him as saying.
Gueterres further called for “a ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems operating without human control, with a legally binding instrument by 2026,” APP reported.
“Similarly, any decision in nuclear weapon use must rest with humans — not machines”, APP quoted the UN Secretary General as saying.
“From nuclear arms control to aviation safety, the international community has risen to the challenge of technologies that could destabilise our societies —by agreeing to rules, building institutions, and insisting on human dignity,” he said.
“The window is closing to shape AI — for peace, for justice, for humanity. We must act without delay.”
Addressing the council, Yejin Choi, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence, pointed out that the “current progress in AI is too concentrated among a handful of companies and countries.”
“When only a few have the resources to build and benefit from AI, we leave the rest of the world waiting at the door,” she said.
“Let us expand what intelligence can be — and let everyone everywhere have a role in building it.”
“Ms Choi urged governments and international institutions to invest in alternative approaches beyond scaling ever-larger models, arguing that smaller, more adaptive systems could lower barriers to entry,” APP reported.
“She also pressed for stronger representation of linguistic and cultural diversity, noting that today’s leading AI models underperform for many non-English languages and reflect narrow cultural assumptions.”
The development comes a day after Google announced the rollout of its “Google AI Plus plan” in 40 more countries, including Pakistan.
“Pakistan’s digital landscape is vibrant and growing, and we’ve been inspired by the creativity Pakistanis have shown in adopting AI tools,” said the Country Director of Google Pakistan, Farhan Qureshi, in a statement.
In July, the federal cabinet approved the National AI Policy 2025.
The policy outlined training a million AI professionals by 2030, establishing an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, creating 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years.
“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” PM Shehbaz said while chairing the July meeting.</p><small>2025-09-25 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2513571522dfec3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944531/south-china-cleans-up-after-powerful-typhoon-ragasa' target='_blank'><strong>South China cleans up after powerful Typhoon Ragasa</strong></a><br><p>Hundreds of thousands of people in southern China were clearing up Thursday after powerful Typhoon Ragasa crashed through Guangdong Province, ripping down trees, destroying fences and blasting signs off buildings.
Ragasa churned into Guangdong, home to tens of millions of people, with winds up to 145 kilometres (90 miles) per hour, on Wednesday after sweeping past Hong Kong and killing at least 14 in Taiwan.
AFP journalists at the impact point around the city of Yangjiang on Thursday saw fallen trees, while road signs and debris were strewn across the streets.
A light rain and breeze still lingered as residents worked to clean up the damage; however, authorities have not reported any storm-related fatalities.
On Hailing — an island administered by Yangjiang —relief workers attempted to clear a huge tree that had fallen across a wide road. Cars drove on muddy tracks to get around the wreckage as the team worked to saw off branches.
A seafood restaurant had sustained heavy damage, its back roof completely collapsed, or in parts flown away entirely.
“The winds were so strong, you could see it completely ripped everything apart,” said restaurant worker Lin Xiaobing, 50.
“There’s no electricity (at home),” she said while helping clear up the mess inside the restaurant, where the floors were covered in water, mud, and debris. “Today, some homes still have electricity and others don’t.”
The island is a popular holiday spot, and many locals rely on the tourism industry to make a living.
“We can’t do business here during the National Day,” she said, referring to China’s annual holiday period centred on October 1 but that lasts until October 8.
“We were planning to do some business this National Day to make up for it,” she added. “But now we may not be able to.”
Taiwan fatalities
Ragasa’s passage in Taiwan killed at least 14 and injured dozens more when a decades-old barrier lake burst in eastern Hualien county, according to regional officials who late Wednesday revised the death toll down from 17 after eliminating duplicate cases.
Authorities initially said 152 people were unaccounted for, but later made contact with more than 100 of them and were still trying to confirm the actual number of missing.
The storm made landfall in mainland China near Hailing Island on Wednesday evening.
By that point, authorities across China had already ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the nation’s south, affecting tens of millions of people.
Nearly 2.2 million people in Guangdong were relocated by Wednesday afternoon, but local officials later said several cities in the province started lifting restrictions on schools and businesses.
Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Ragasa made its second landfall in Beihai, Guangxi, on Thursday morning as a tropical storm.
Chinese authorities earmarked the equivalent of about $49.2 million to support rescue and relief work in regions hit by Typhoon Ragasa, Xinhua news agency said.
Hong Kong battered
Hong Kong authorities said 101 people were treated at public hospitals for injuries sustained during the typhoon as of Wednesday evening, with more than 900 people seeking refuge at 50 temporary shelters across the city.
The Chinese finance hub recorded hundreds of fallen trees and flooding in multiple neighbourhoods.
Many of the city’s tall buildings swayed and rattled in the harsh winds.
About 1,000 flights were affected by Ragasa, the airport authority said Wednesday evening, adding that they expected to return to normal operations within the next two days.
The top typhoon warning was downgraded in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon after being in force for 10 hours, 40 minutes — the second-longest on the city’s record.
Hong Kong’s weather service ranked the storm the strongest yet in the northwestern Pacific this year.</p><small>2025-09-25 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/251103343011d84.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944523/pm-shehbaz-calls-on-world-to-honour-climate-pledges-says-loans-are-not-solution' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls on world to honour climate pledges, says loans are not solution</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday called upon the international community to honour its commitment on climate finance, stressing that debt-driven finance cannot address the climate catastrophe confronting vulnerable nations like Pakistan.
Pakistan experienced unprecedented floods and landslides this year amid record monsoon rains, triggered by climate change. The country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reports that since late June, more than 1,000 people have been killed, with nearly 1,100 left injured due to monsoon-related disasters.
Back in 2022, the country faced widespread devastation because of the floods,  which killed 1,700 people, wiped off swathes of agricultural land, displaced millions, and incurred losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates. Following the disaster, Pakistan held an international donors’ conference in Geneva, asking the world to help fund its flood recovery.
Earlier this year, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs was told that out of the $10 billion pledged to Pakistan by various countries, only $500 million came as a grant, with the remainder extended as loans, as reported by Profit.
“Loans over loans, [and] adding to loans is not a solution,” the prime minister said while speaking at the Special Climate Event convened by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, along with the president of Brazil — the host of COP 30 — for member states to present new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with targets for the year 2035.
PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s commitment to be part of the solution to the climate crisis, hoping that the international community would also honour its commitment for the sake of the country’s future generations.
He reminded delegates that Pakistan was still reeling from the scars of the 2022 floods, which inflicted losses exceeding $30bn and displaced millions.
“This year, intense monsoon rains, cloudbursts, flash floods and devastating urban flooding have impacted more than five million people, destroyed 4,100 villages, and claimed over 1,000 precious lives,” he added.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, the prime minister said that despite a negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, “we bear impacts far beyond our share”.
However, he stated that the country’s commitment to delivering on its climate agenda remained steadfast and unwavering.
In 2022, Pakistan was ranked among the most vulnerable countries to climate change.
“In our 2021 Nationally Determined Contribution, Pakistan committed to an unconditional 15 per cent reduction in projected greenhouse gas emissions by 2030,“ he said.
As part of the overall target of cutting emissions by 50pc, he shared that Pakistan had already delivered on its unconditional pledge of a 15pc reduction.
“Renewables are presently providing over 32pc of Pakistan’s power mix. Solar energy has grown sevenfold since 2021,” the prime minister added.
Furthermore, he emphasised that 23,000 hectares of mangrove forests had been restored.
He regretted, however, that the implementation of Pakistan’s national adaptation plan was “hampered, and hampered severely, due to inadequate international climate finance”.
 
 

PM Shehbaz announced an increase in the share of renewables and hydropower to 62pc of the country’s energy mix by 2035, expanding nuclear energy capacity by 1,200 megawatts by 2030, shifting 30pc of transport to cleaner mobility by 2030 and establishing 3,000 charging stations nationwide.
He also announced the scaling up of climate-smart agriculture, safeguarding of water security, and advancement of the plantation of 1bn trees.
Earlier, in his remarks, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that it was still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by century’s end.
He told the gathering that clean energy was powering jobs, growth and sustainable development, besides generating the fastest and cheapest electricity and insulating economies from volatile fossil fuel markets.
“The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative,” he remarked.
He said that the Paris Agreement had made a difference as in the last 10 years, adding, “Now, we need new plans for 2035 that go much further, and much faster.”
The UN chief stressed that “COP30 in Brazil must conclude with a credible global response plan to get us on track and “show a credible path to mobilising the $1.3tr annually in climate finance by 2035, as agreed at COP29 in Baku”, including identifying funding sources, making finance accessible, and ensuring accountability.
He also underlined that “developing countries that did least to cause the crisis are suffering most”, calling for “effective debt relief and scaled-up solutions like debt swaps and disaster pause clauses”.</p><small>2025-09-25 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/23133949ddcd288.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943227/revolutions-interrupted-why-digital-politics-of-the-youth-is-fuelling-outrage-not-transformation' target='_blank'><strong>Revolutions interrupted: Why digital politics of the youth is fuelling outrage, not transformation</strong></a><br><p>In 2011, the much feted Arab Spring was triggered by the self-immolation of a well-educated street vendor in Tunisia, spreading to Egypt, Bahrain and many other countries. Millions of people came out onto the streets in defiance of dictators and monarchs who had ruled with an iron fist for decades.
The people had their victory, deposing hated figures like Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak. But ultimately, the Arab Spring left a bitter taste. Authoritarian regimes and an even more exploitative capitalist order were restored in almost all of the Middle East and North Africa. Countries like Syria and Libya were ravaged by imperialist-sponsored proxy wars. Almost 15 years on, the status quo has not only been restored but appears even more entrenched.
The spontaneous mass protests which shook Nepal in early September generated a great deal of commentary in Pakistan, with some making comparisons to the Arab Spring. By joining the dots and linking the Nepali case with Sri Lanka’s mass uprisings of 2022 and the student-led movement which deposed Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh in 2024, some suggested that South Asia is the new Middle East.
A new normal has indeed emerged in how young, alienated masses articulate their politics. The question, however, is what lies at the end of this new modality of political assertion.
To answer that, it helps to trace the commonalities and differences among uprisings across South Asia in recent years, and to situate them alongside similar movements in other parts of the world, from the Middle East to beyond. Whether Pakistan and its neighbours reinforce these global trends or chart their own path remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that the politics of the (youth) bulge is here to stay.
It’s the economy, stupid
As in much of the Arab world, economic hardship lies at the heart of recent popular upsurges across our region. In Nepal, young people poured onto the streets after the government banned social media platforms — tools they rely on not only to vent anger against the prevailing order but also as a means of securing highly precarious gig work. Successive left-leaning governments have failed to create adequate livelihood opportunities, with un- and underemployment rates estimated to be over 20 per cent.. Little wonder, then, that vast numbers of Nepalis seek work abroad, with remittances now accounting for an astonishing 33pc of the country’s GDP.
 
 

The situation across the region is similar; Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh have even younger populations with foreign migrant workers numbering in the tens of millions. A significant number give themselves over to human smugglers and face dire consequences as a result, including death. At the root of this crisis is the absence of any durable programme of industrialisation and/ or job creation capable of absorbing a rapidly expanding labour force that is steadily being displaced from the agrarian sector. Those who cannot migrate abroad are overwhelmingly pushed into the informal economy, where they face super-exploitation and a perpetual uncertainty about their futures. As the Nepal case demonstrates, even relatively well-educated youth rely on temporary, low-wage gig work — a telling marker of both their aspirations and their precarity.
Marx prophesised that the economic strangulation of wage labour by capital
would create both the material conditions and alienation to trigger
revolutionary upheaval if working masses were armed with an ideological
programme. South Asian youth do not even have access to regular waged work,
and rather than any coherent ideological unity and attendant political
organisations, their political consciousness and action is mediated by digital
technologies.
The digital lifeworld
One need not look beyond Pakistani shores to understand the profound impact of digitalisation on politics. Whether the focus is on mainstream political parties such as the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), religio-political organisations like the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), feminist assertion through the Aurat March, or popular movements in the ethnic peripheries like the Baloch Yekjehti Committee (BYC) and the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), the youth are largely inspired by — and mobilise through — digital platforms.
In parallel, the state delimits the ideological terrain of the digital lifeworld, using both its own power and colluding with Big Tech platforms to delegitimise and even criminalise the demands of popular movements; of the four examples cited above, only the TLP has been spared such attacks in recent times.
 
 

As more and more young people become active on social media, online content increasingly takes on political overtones, including satire. The vast majority of young people who vent against the system online are generally unaware that their data is being used by Big Tech to facilitate surveillance by the state or that the business model of what critical scholars call ‘platform capitalism’ is based on the selling of users’ data to advertisers.
Understood thus, youth perceive these digital platforms to be the only space to express their democratic aspirations. Mainstream political parties are captured by the establishment and propertied classes while the mainstream media operates within official limits. This is why so many popular movements gestate in digital spaces.
Yet their limits are clear. The Arab Spring’s initially celebrated horizontalism and leader-less characteristics ultimately gave way to fragmentation and the restoration of class and state power. In Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now in Nepal, it is the established institutions of state like the army that have ultimately stepped into breach.
In Nepal’s case, pro-royalists seeking to restore the monarchy that was deposed in 2005 have made a comeback. As such, the historic gains of the communist left — which came to power through elections after successfully leading armed struggle against the monarchy — have largely been squandered. Neither could the left build a viable political organisation at the grassroots nor could it operationalise a transformative economic programme through state power. The result is a disenfranchised mass of young people who are left to deploy digital mobilisation strategies to generate spontaneous outbursts of popular assertion.
In Pakistan’s case, the PTI rose to prominence largely by mobilising millions of young people online. During the infamous period when the party leadership and the military establishment were on the ‘same page’, this online support base even functioned as the state’s frontline against so-called ‘fifth generation warriors’. But when Imran Khan’s government was quite literally booted out of power in April 2022, online sentiment underwent an about-turn. More than three years on, however, it is clear that for all of PTI’s formidable digital reach, its on-ground organisation remains too shallow to withstand sustained repression by the coercive state apparatus.
Beware coloured ‘revolutions’
The motif of ‘coloured revolutions’ is most closely associated with the collapse of actually existing socialism in Eastern Europe. From Ukraine to the former Yugoslavia, a wave of upheavals unfolded from the late 1980s onwards, ushering in a new era of liberal democracy and so-called ‘free market’ economics. In practice, the coloured ‘revolutions’ brought pro-western despots to power, who then presided over firesale privatisation of public assets and the establishment of a new repressive oligarchic regime.
 
 

In retrospect, the Arab Spring was similarly co-opted by US imperialism and its various lackeys. The Western media even branded the Tunisian uprising the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ — a label fiercely rejected by many within the country who recognised how external agendas were being imposed upon their struggle.
One does not have to believe in clumsy conspiracy theories to recognise that the 2024 student-led uprising in Bangladesh has had significant implications for the balance of forces both within the country and vis-à-vis its relations with neighbours. The emergence of the dubious figure of Muhammad Younus, along with the reinvigoration of the army top brass and religious right make clear that youth aspirations are being mediated by the ancien regime. Meanwhile, where the Sheikh Hasina regime counted New Delhi as its closest regional ally, the current Bangaldeshi dispensation has realigned itself to give more space to Rawalpindi-Islamabad.
In Nepal, even as the protests played out, there was suspicion about the especially violent elements who deployed arson as a clear strategy, with Ravilaxmi Chitrakar, wife of a former prime minister, still in critical care after suffering high-grade burns. Some Gen Z student leaders have since suggested that their entire movement was hijacked; when the dust settles, the army is now well-placed to single out anyone as a troublemaker who must be eliminated to enforce the ‘reform’ agenda.
Where’s the ideological unity?
One need not subscribe to a nihilistic worldview — whereby all popular forms of political assertion will inevitably be co-opted by the forces of reaction — to recognise a fundamental truth: that the people’s will can only endure if channelled through a robust, grassroots political vehicle, one not beholden to the ancien regime.
The politics of the bulge is a reflection of the systemic rot produced by a postcolonial capitalism increasingly shorn of any pretence of consent, alienating even well-educated youthful segments. As class war intensifies, the state and foreign patrons rely more on repression and/or co-option. Mainstream parties are unwilling or unable to articulate an alternative economic programme. This is why the youthful mass of working people is resorting to digital outrage.
But this is not sufficient to transform the conditions of their existence. Indeed, in the absence of a substantial revolutionary horizon and organisational capacity to match, the euphoria of upheaval more often than not gives way to despair and a deepening of the status quo.

So far, only 4.5 million girls out of the targeted 13 million have been vaccinated against the virus, which causes cervical cancer.
The update was shared with State Minister for National Health Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, who visited the HPV vaccination site at Islamabad Model School for Girls (IMSG), G-6/1-3, to observe the public health effort.
The visit was organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI).
The campaign, which began on 17 September, will conclude on 27 September.
Participants at the event included Dr Soofia Yunus, Director General of FDI; Dr Khurram Akram, Director (Technical), FDI Islamabad; Sharmeela Rasool, Deputy Country Representative, UNICEF Pakistan; Ellen Thon, Deputy WHO Representative, Pakistan; Dr Rashida Batool, District Health Officer; and Ms Mehreen Balooch, Assistant Commissioner ICT.
“This campaign is more than a vaccination drive — it is a promise of a healthier future for our daughters.
Every girl vaccinated is a life protected, a family safeguarded, and a future secured,” said Dr. Bharath.
 
 

He added, “Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women in Pakistan, with two out of three women diagnosed not surviving.
“The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective, and scientifically proven solution to prevent cervical cancer and save lives. Increasing HPV coverage among girls averts more deaths per person vaccinated than any other immunisation activity.”
A social media campaign was launched before the vaccination drive, but many parents refused to vaccinate their daughters.
Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal attempted to raise awareness by vaccinating his daughter in front of the media.
Reassuring parents, Dr Bharath stressed that the HPV vaccine was halal, endorsed by leading Islamic scholars, and already included in the national immunisation schedules of Muslim-majority countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Qatar, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.
“Protecting life (Hifz al-Nafs) is among the highest obligations in Islam. Shielding our daughters from a preventable disease is both a moral and religious duty,” he said.
Pakistan’s HPV vaccination campaign is aligned with the World Health Organisation’s Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative, which seeks to ensure that 90 percent of girls worldwide are vaccinated against HPV by age 15 by 2030.
The campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1, running from 15–27 September 2025, covers Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.
“The HPV vaccine is safe, free, and available to every eligible girl. By protecting their health today, we are safeguarding their education, their future, and their ability to contribute to society. Let us keep this momentum going until every eligible girl is reached,” Dr Bharath said.

Senator Faisal Vawda claimed that the FBR is finalising a plan to tax income earned by TikTokers, suggesting that the largest share of recoverable taxes would come from Punjab. He urged the tax authority to begin enforcement there.
The committee, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, also reviewed the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the government’s remittance subsidy policy. Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan informed members that the subsidy, originally introduced in 2020 at 20 Saudi riyals per transaction, was raised to 30 in 2024 but has since been reduced back to 20 riyals.

Senators question remittance subsidies benefiting banks

Vawda criticised the move and described the policy as a “scandal”, alleging that commercial banks were benefiting disproportionately from the scheme. He called for a formal inquiry and urged the FBR to recover the allegedly misappropriated funds.
Chairman Mandviwalla also raised concerns, stating that while the PRI was designed to support overseas Pakistanis, its financial benefits were not reaching intended recipients. Instead, he noted, banks and money transfer operators appeared to be absorbing the subsidy. He called for rationalisation of transaction costs to ensure that remittance beneficiaries in Pakistan receive full value.
It directed the Ministry of Finance to provide a detailed report on expenditures and reversals linked to the remittance subsidy scheme over the past three to four years. It also recommended a comprehensive review of the PRI framework to prevent misuse and improve transparency.
In response, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani assured the committee that the issue would be examined in consultation with the State Bank and other stakeholders. He emphasised the need to streamline the mechanism and address gaps in implementation.
The FBR chief updated the committee on the non-implementation of a Presidential Order issued on July 16, 2025, noting that the matter is under litigation before the Sindh High Court.

Announcing the agreement at a press conference, Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari stated that the decision followed talks between the federal government, the GB government, and regional business leaders.
Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, and trader representatives were also present. A formal agreement was signed and released to the media.
The tax exemptions apply to sales tax, advance income tax, and federal excise duty collected by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but only for goods imported via the Silk Route Dry Port (SRDP) in Sost and consumed within Gilgit-Baltistan. The initiative aims to support regional trade and facilitate economic development.
Leghari said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had approved the relief package after a committee led by him finalised recommendations within 45 days. He noted that longstanding policy and tax issues had stalled trade through the Sost port, and the relief package was designed in consultation with all stakeholders, including local traders and the GB leadership.

Imports through Sost dry port will be exempt from sales tax, advance income tax, and FED

Conditions and limitations
Under the agreement, only goods declared for local consumption in GB — brought in by locally registered firms owned by indigenous residents — will qualify. The GB government must authorise these firms, and all imports must be accurately declared to Pakistan Customs, with no misrepresentation. The exemption will apply only to items listed under a predefined list of positive tariff lines.
 
 

The total annual value of tax exemptions has been capped at Rs4bn. Quotas for each product line will be based on assessed customs values, and relief will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis through the Customs system.
Imports that exceed quota limits or violate conditions will not qualify for tax exemption, even if pre-approved. In the event of shortages or emergency requirements, trade bodies may request additional quotas or special concessions from federal authorities through the GB government.
The tax exemption scope will be reviewed every two years, or earlier if necessary, and may be modified or suspended if port operations are disrupted or if goods are smuggled out of the GB region. The government reserves the right to withdraw relief for items found in commercial quantities outside GB.
Additional measures
A custom tribunal will hear Sost-related cases as needed, and a Deputy Director of Valuation will visit GB on an annual basis. The terminal operator will review cases of delay, detention, or demurrage on stuck consignments.
Goods imported in violation of the Import Policy Order will be confiscated after due legal process.
The minister emphasised that the tax relief is part of broader efforts to boost trade and address the longstanding concerns of the GB business community, which has protested against what they called unfair taxation and regulatory hurdles.

These dues will be serviced through a Rs3.23 per unit surcharge on consumers for a period of six years.
The signing ceremony was held at the PM Office, witnessed virtually by the prime minister from New York. No official announcement was made, although ministers confirmed the signing of the agreement. Under the agreement, the government will have 30 days to request disbursements from banks for prompt utilisation to avoid penalties.
 
 

Any withdrawal request not fully used within the period will lapse. After the request is made, the government will have three months to draw down the approved funds.
The servicing of the Rs1.225tr debt would be serviced through a Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) at the rate of Rs3.23 per unit. Of this, Rs659bn would be used for loans payable by Power Holding Ltd (PHL) – a shell subsidiary of the Power Division. The remaining funds would be used to pay dues to IPPs, petroleum sector entities, and make subsidy adjustments, including through book adjustments and cash settlements.
 
 

The Ministry of Finance facilitated the loan agreements with 18 banks, including Habib Bank, Meezan Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, Allied Bank Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Faysal Bank Ltd, Bank Al Habib Ltd, MCB Bank Ltd, Bank Alfalah, Dubai Islamic Bank, Bank of Punjab, BankIslami Pakistan, Askari Bank Ltd, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Al Baraka Bank Ltd, Bank of Khyber, MCB Islamic Bank and Soneri Bank.

Electricity consumers to bear Rs3.23 per unit surcharge for six more years

The cabinet had already approved the loan facility and the payment structure, under which the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) was designated as the agent on behalf of the distribution companies (Discos) to perform public service obligations and steps for circular debt stock financing and settlement under the SOE Act.
 
 

The term sheets with banks were finalised under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Pakistan, under which loans would entail Kibor minus 9pc for six years, and repayments would range between Rs310-315bn per quarter, based on estimated Rs3.23 per unit DSS recoveries from consumers.
The DSS already in place for five years under previous loans was to expire by the end of June 2025, but would be continued for the next six years. The total interest on the loan facility has been estimated at approximately Rs640bn.
For this, amendments to Section 31(8) of the Nepra Act were made part of the Finance Bill 2025-26 for DSS, which also removed a cap of 10pc of the base tariff. The power sector’s circular debt currently stands at around Rs1.661 trillion as of the end of July 2025, with a Rs47bn jump in July alone. It was brought down to Rs2.393tr by the end of June through the utilisation of Rs780bn fiscal space on account of subsidy allocations.
Over the past weeks, the Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry termed the loans and fiscal injections as unsustainable without deep-rooted structural reforms to reduce system losses and improve recoveries, besides addressing other inefficiencies.
Amid little reform and a stock of over Rs4.6tr circular debt, Pakistan’s energy sector continues to weigh heavily on its economy across all sectors, owing to weak collections, theft, poor infrastructure, governance problems, and market inefficiencies.
“Taken together, there is about 4pc of GDP worth of debt stemming from the energy sector. The repercussion of this debt reverberates throughout the economy, not only impacting the fiscal but also growth, inflation, the external balance, and the financial sector”, observed Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF).
It said circular debt and energy subsidies added significant pressure to public finances, contributing to persistent fiscal imbalances and forcing the government to allocate resources away from other investments, social programmes, and infrastructure projects, and crowding out the private sector.

The division bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, delivered the verdict during a hearing of a constitutional petition filed by senior lawyer Sajid Tareen Advocate.
After hearing arguments from the petitioner and BNP’s Central Secretary Information Agha Hassan Baloch Advocate, the bench ordered the removal of Mengal’s name from the no-fly list.
Officials’ absence irks bench
At a separate hearing, the same bench expressed dissatisfaction over prolonged power outages and the absence of senior officials the court had earlier summoned.

The court had ordered the chief secretary of Balochistan, the CEO of the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco), and the principal secretary to the CM to appear in person with a report on electrifying solar tube wells and reducing loadshedding.
Qesco’s legal adviser Barrister Muzaffar Azam informed the court that the CEO was “busy in Islamabad” and could not attend the hearing. No report was submitted on behalf of the Additional Advocate General.
The court noted that Qesco officials were disconnecting household connections attached to tube wells without notice, causing severe hardship for farmers. It observed that widespread power loadshedding was disrupting education, office and business activities.
Detailed report sought
Subsequently, the court directed the three officials to appear in person at the next hearing on Oct 7 and submit detailed replies.
Additionally, the bench expressed strong displeasure over traffic disruptions at Lakpass Tunnel and sought a detailed report from relevant authorities.
The court declared a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung “unsatisfactory” and ordered him to appear at the next hearing with a comprehensive plan to improve traffic flow.
The bench remarked that criminal activities and public problems around the tunnel have been rising for the past year.
Despite repeated calls, the petitioner’s lawyer did not appear, however, according to the petition, Levies, Customs, and FC North posts at the tunnel, which connects Quetta with several districts, often cause vehicles to be “stuck for hours”.
The court directed the Deputy Attorney General and FC North’s counsel to explain at the next hearing why the check points had not been shifted to a more suitable location.

• Several parts of Jamshoro remain under water
LAHORE / DADU: A vast reservoir of floodwater continues to rise along the eastern side of the M-5 motorway, inundating farmland and threatening to erase entire  villages in Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil.
Fifteen days after breaches first appeared at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River, residents in union councils across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran remain stranded, with many clinging to embankments as the water  swallows their homes.
To prevent damage to the highway, the  National Highway Authority (NHA) has blocked culverts and bridges with  heavy stones, effectively turning the motorway into a dam.
But this is preventing floodwaters from draining away and causing water levels to rise on the eastern side, creating a dam-like effect from Noraja  Bhutta embankment to the motorway.
Communities in Noraja Bhutta,  Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, Dipal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur,  Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and surrounding areas are  among the most severely affected.
“Thousands of people were becoming homeless due to floodwater in their tehsil  Jalalpur Pirwala,” said Muhammad Bakhsh, a resident of Basti Lang who evacuated his family to Ahmadpur Sharqia.

He said he and his sons returned on Wednesday to find most of their houses had collapsed.
“All of our belongings, including wheat, refrigerators, beds, doors, washing machines, air conditioners and other items, were washed away,” Mr  Bakhsh said, adding that theft from abandoned homes is now rampant.
Residents  argue that a controlled cut in the motorway would drain the water,  which they say currently cannot find a path to the Chenab River.
“The government was not giving way to water and closed all the bridges under M-5 motorway and made the eastern side of Jalalpur a dam,” Mr Bakhsh said.
The NHA defended its actions as necessary to preserve the critical infrastructure.
 
 

“We are placing stones around the motorway for its safety,” NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn. He stated they were not closing waterways but were reinforcing points where the speed of the water could cause damage.
Mr  Nawaz said he did not have equipment to measure if water levels were  rising and that controlling the inflow was the irrigation department’s  responsibility.
Flooding in Jamshoro
According to authorities in Sindh, a medium-level flood that is moving through the  Indus, has submerged vast tracts of agricultural land and dozens of villages. The flow at Kotri Barrage is around 400,000 cusecs, leaving most low-lying areas between Sehwan, Jamshoro and Kotri inundated.
The towns of Kotri, Khanpur, and Karoon Khu remain safe for now. However, in  Petaro, UCs Manzoorabad and Moro Jabal are submerged. In the  Manjhand area, villages including Aliabad, Khanot, Indpur, and Budhapur are affected. Over 20 rural settlements in the floodplain are now underwater, forcing residents to evacuate to safer locations on their own.
Flooding has cut off land routes to many villages from Sehwan and Bhan Saeedabad.

According to Hindustan Times, the FIR was registered following orders by the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivili, which directed the Bangur Nagar police to register an FIR against Nusli Wadia, Maureen Wadia, 78, Ness Wadia, 54, Jehangir Wadia, 52, H.J. Bamji, 75, K.F. Bharucha and R.E. Wandewala, 65, for alleged cheating and forgery.
The case revolves around a 30-year-old development agreement between Wadia and Ferani Hotels on a plot of land in Malad, which Ferani Hotels was to develop with builder K. Raheja and pay Wadia 12pc of the gross sale proceeds. Disputes arose in 2008, leading to legal battles over Wadia’s share of sales and the management of the land. The case has involved allegations of mala fide, lack of authority, and commercial disputes, and has proceeded through various courts, including the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court.
On Monday, the case was registered under Sections 3(5) (general explanations), 318(4) (cheating), 331(2) (punishment for house-trespass or house-breaking), 336(3) (forgery), 339 (possession of a document described in Section 337 or Section 338, knowing it to be forged and intending to use it as genuine), 340(2) (forged document or electronic record and using it as genuine), and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.
According to the FIR, Mahendra Chande, the chief executive officer of Ferani Hotels Private Limited and its group companies, complained to the police that the accused persons had allegedly forged documents and submitted them to the Bombay high court in 2010 in a commercial matter against them.
Chande said he had lodged a complaint with the Bangur Nagar police station on March 15, and again with the Mumbai police commissioner on March 24, but the police did not register an FIR. Based on his complaint, the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivali on Sept 20 issued the order to the Bangur Nagar police station.
“We are still verifying the complaint and will be able to comment on the matter only after scrutinising the bulky documents involved in the case,” said a police officer from Bangur Nagar police station.
Despite text and WhatsApp messages, Nusli’s son, Ness Wadia, remained unavailable for comment, the paper said.

Under Article 209 of the Constitution, the SJC consists of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, and two senior-most chief justices of high courts.
CJP Yahya Afridi heads the forum, while Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar represent the Supreme Court. Among chief justices, LHC’s Chief Justice Alia Neelum was already a member, and the seat vacated following the retirement of SHC Chief Justice Junaid Ghaffar has now been filled by Jus­tice Dogar, who ranks as the most senior among the sitting high court chiefs.
 
 

The Constitution says that seniority among chief justices of high courts is determined by their dates of appointment as permanent chief justices, and in case of a tie, by their earlier appointment as judges of any high court. It further stipulates that if a member is unable to act due to illness or conflict of interest, the next senior judge or chief justice automatically substitutes him.

• Ruling underscores principle of judicial equality, places emphasis on judicial discipline; affirms that judges cannot ‘pick and choose’ cases
• IHC judges’ pleas ‘still under review’, says SC spox
ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court, in an 11-page verdict, has ruled that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers, establishing that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
He explained that judges within the superior cou­rts share equal power and status, with no individual holding superiority or inferiority over another. He warned that allowing judges to take such punitive mea­sures against one another would cripple the judiciary.
The ruling formally justified why a six-judge Supreme Court bench on Jan 27 disposed of an Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) filed by Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas. Mr Abbas had faced contempt proceedings from a smaller two-judge bench for his non-compliance with a judicial order.
The additional registrar was subsequently removed from his office for withdrawing a case challenging the Customs Act from that two-judge bench, which was headed by a senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, and transferring it to a larger Constitutional Bench.
Justice Mandokhail warned that permitting judges to hold their colleagues in contempt could ignite internal conflicts, ultimately threatening the integrity of the entire justice system.
“Permitting superior court judges to initiate contempt proceedings against his fellow judges would militate against the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity amongst them,” Justice Mandokhail wrote.
He cautioned that such a practice would foster an environment of hostility rather than collegiality, severely damaging the institution’s credibility.
“The maintenance of cordial relations amongst members of the superior judiciary is important for the smooth functioning of courts and issuing a process of contempt of court by a judge against his fellow judge would create internal conflicts, grievances and grudges amongst themselves,” the judgement said.
The justice painted a dire picture of the potential consequences.
“There would be anarchy and justice system would crumble, which will be against the principle of ‘Esprit de corps’ (common spirit existing in the members of a group and inspiring enthusiasm, devotion, and strong regard for the honour of the group),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
He added that “the trend will erode public trust and that no legal system can permit judicial system to collapse.”
The judgement affirmed that while judges possess inherent constitutional power to initiate contempt of court proceedings, this authority does not extend to their colleagues on the bench.
“Judges of the superior courts possess the same status and power within their hierarchy, therefore, no one amongst them neither was superior or inferior to issue direction nor can punish the other,” he noted.
The ruling clarified the boundaries of judicial immunity, observing that while judges are generally protected for their judicial work and administrative functions, this protection is not absolute and does not shield them from accountability for misconduct. However, the proper and sole channel for such accountability is the Supreme Judicial Council.
“The allegation of misconduct against a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court can only be inquired into and dealt with under Article 209 of the Constitution by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
Recalling a rare historical instance, the justice referenced the case of Iftikhar Chaudhry and others, in which the Supreme Court had issued contempt notices to several apex and high court judges for violating a restraining order from Nov 3, 2007. However, Justice Mandokhail stressed that the context of that case was unique and markedly different from the matter at hand.
The judgement also delved into crucial matters of judicial procedure and discipline, particularly the handling of “part-heard” cases.
Justice Mandokhail affirmed the well-settled legal principle that matters partially heard by a bench should not be transferred administratively unless explicitly permitted by law or constitutional rules.
“The purpose behind this principle was that once a bench or a court hears a case at a considerable length, transferring that case from that court can lead to a denovo hearing,” he explained.
However, he introduced a critical exception that directly applied to the registrar’s case: if a court’s jurisdiction is removed through new legislation or a constitutional amendment while a matter is pending, that court loses all authority to proceed.   “The court where the matter is pending or is treated as part-heard, it loses its authority to take any further action into the matter, hence, must stop proceedings,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
“With great respect, there was no justification for the regular bench for further proceedings into the matter in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Constitution after the amendment,” he emphasised.   He noted that court committees also had no power to override the constitutional change.
Underscoring that judges are bound by their oath and a strict Code of Conduct, he said, “If every judge of the SC or of a High Court starts picking and choosing cases for disposal by him, without following the practice and procedure in vogue, of their respective courts, the discipline in the court will be damaged.”
IHC judges’ petition under review
Separately, the Supreme Court said that petitions filed by five senior sitting judges from the Islamabad High Court are in the normal process of review and that any order regarding their fate will be made in due course.
“Petitions are in the normal process of procedural scrutiny and any order thereon is to be made in due course,” said Dr. Shahid Hussain Kamboyo, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court.
 
 

On Sept 19, five judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz — personally appeared before the apex court to file their constitutional petitions.
The petitioner judges pleaded with the Supreme Court to declare that the administrative powers of the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court cannot be deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers of high court judges.  They sought a declaration that the CJ-IHC was not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases once a high court bench was already seized of a matter.
It also asked the apex court to declare that the CJ-IHC cannot exclude available judges from the roster at will and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions.

“Addressing difficulties faced by victims of various financial scams in receiving their amounts, NAB has decided to transfer recovered funds to victims online,” says an official press release issued by the NAB headquarters on Wednesday.
The new payment system was launched at a ceremony presided over by NAB chairman retired Lt-Gen Nazir Ahmed. In the first phase, recovered funds were directly transferred online to victims of the B4U fraud.
The NAB chief himself initiated the online transfer of funds directly into the bank accounts of victims.
In the past, NAB used to return money to a limited number of victims at a time via pay orders, a time-consuming process that required victims to physically visit NAB offices to receive their money. Now, NAB has completely digitised this process so that funds can be transferred directly to the victims’ bank accounts, eliminating the traditional, time-consuming method, the press release said.
At the ceremony, NAB Islamabad/Rawalpindi region transferred Rs878.709 million to accounts of 5,008 victims of the B4U fraud in a single day
NAB began its investigation into the B4U fraud in Feb 2021 based on complaints from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the victims.
The investigation has now been completed after which the accused have admitted a liability of Rs7.3 billion, of which an initial amount of Rs3.7 billion has been recovered and it is being distributed among 17,250 victims. The remaining amount will be distributed among victims after its recovery.
