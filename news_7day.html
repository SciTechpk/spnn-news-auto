The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for recognising regional Olympic councils for Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying the move had violated the Olympic Charter.
“We also spoke about the Independent Neutral Athletes (AINs). This will be nothing new,” IOC President Kirsty Coventry told a press conference.  “The executive board will take the exact same approach that was done in Paris (2024 Olympics). Nothing has changed.”
Russian and Belarusian athletes who reach qualifying times will be first vetted for any links to the Russian military or support of the war in Ukraine, both of which will exclude them.
Russian teams are banned from the Games. Belarus has acted as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine.
A small number of individual Russian and Belarusian athletes were allowed to take part as AINs in the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics after first passing rigorous vetting by the IOC. They competed without the Russian or Belarusian flag and anthem. Instead, they took part as neutral athletes.
It remains to be seen how winter sports federations will respond to the IOC’s decision.
Some have maintained a total ban on Russians. These include the International Ski Federation (FIS), whose disciplines account for more than half of the podium places at the Winter Olympics.
The International Biathlon Union (IBU) is taking the same line, as is the International Luge Federation (FIL), which conducted an anonymous survey among its athletes revealing  “their concerns about safety, Olympic quotas, compliance with anti-doping regulations and fairness” in the event of a Russian return.
The organisation governing skating, the ISU has opened a narrow path to Olympic qualification, allowing one competitor from each of the two nations in each category, but no entries in relays or team events.

The accused pled not guilty to murdering Yousaf, who was shot dead at her house in June.
During the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka enquired whether Hayat had killed Sana.
“I did not commit any such crime,” the accused replied.
The judge then asked him whether he was falsely accused in the case.
“Is this all a lie?” the judge remarked. He also pointed out that Hayat had also been accused of snatching Yousaf’s mobile phone.
At that, the accused maintained that all allegations levelled against him were “based on falsehood”.
The court then adjourned the hearing until September 25.
Islamabad police had arrested Hayat on June 3, a day after Yousaf was killed at her house in Islamabad.
Preceding his arrest, a first information report (FIR) of the murder was registered at Islamabad’s Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, Yousaf’s mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand had entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
Later, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had said during a press conference the police had arrested a suspect, who was a was a 22-year-old man, from Faisalabad.
He said Hayat had tried to contact Yousaf repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”, adding that the accused had taken Yousaf’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered along with the weapon of offence.
On July 25, police had formally submitted the challan against Hayat to the prosecution branch of the district and sessions courts. It also included Hayat’s confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He had confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to kill her.
 
 

Hayat revealed that he had travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him, he said, adding that On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to his repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector of the capital, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
Following the last hearing of the case on September 13, Dawn reported that Hayat had expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate that he felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.
“I feel deeply ashamed for committing such a cruel act,” he had reportedly said, adding that his confession was voluntary and not made under pressure.</p><small>2025-09-20 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201224524b2e1fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943291/all-11-m-5-passengers-safely-recovered-from-katcha-dacoits' target='_blank'><strong>All 11 M-5 passengers safely recovered from Katcha dacoits</strong></a><br><p>RAHIM YAR KHAN: In a joint operation of the police and the country’s premier intelligence agency, the 11 kidnapped passengers from the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) have been safely recovered from the notorious Indhar dacoit gang in the early hours of Friday.
According to police spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa, the police were continuously chasing the dacoits after they kidnapped several people from the motorway a few days ago. He said that after a tip-off, action was taken against the kidnappers and all of the hostages were safely recovered.
As per details, on the night between Sept 4 and Sept 5, the Katcha area dacoits kidnapped 11 people from different vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil. The bandits fired at vehicles on the motorway between 1 and 2am to force them to stop at the Azampur Rest Area and the Guddu Interchange.
In the attack, crew of a passenger bus was reportedly injured and shifted to the emergency ward of the Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) in Rahim Yar Khan. Traffic also remained suspended on the motorway for more than four hours, before it was finally restored at dawn.

Incident happened after police operation near Punjab-Sindh border and Indhar gang threatened retribution

South Punjab Additi­onal Inspector General (IG) Kamran Khan told Dawn that between 20 and 25 suspects attacked vehicles on the motorway. “Three people were injured, two of whom suffered minor injuries, so they were discharged. One remains admitted at the hospital with gunshot wounds to the waist and leg,” he said.
SZMCH spokesperson Rana Ilyas Ahmed confirmed to Dawn that three injured were admitted to the facility and one was receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the leg. The injured were aboard the same coach and hailed from Sheikhupura, he said.
The motorway incident came amid a police operation against the Katcha criminals in which the police used drones in Ronti near the Punjab-Sindh border. The police had destroyed the hideouts of Katcha criminals during the operation.
On the same day, Indhar gang leader Tanvir alias Dodu Indhar threatened the police with retribution. Later on September 8, Dodu Indhar claimed responsibility of the kidnapping. He also claimed that police had killed a person of his tribe after he was released from jail.
He claimed the police was planning a same fate for his brother who would be released in a few months. In another video showing nine of the hostages standing in the floodwater, he claimed that they had killed two of the passengers and demanded the release of his brother. However, all 11 passengers had been recovered alive during the operation.
It is pertinent to mention here that Katcha criminals have kidnapped 72 people so far this year. This is not the first time that the M-5 motorway was targeted by the criminals and after several incidents, the police started escorting vehicles in convoys.

With Yamal missing thr­o­ugh injury, Rashford — a loan signing from Manch­ester United — got a start and scored both Barca goals at St James’ Park. The second took the breath away, a piledriver from 25 metres that flew in off the crossbar.
“It’s an amazing experience playing for Barcelona. I’ve always been a huge admirer of the club. We just want to win as much as possible,” Rashford said. “I’m very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team, that excites me alone. It’s so refreshing to play with these guys.”
De Bruyne was also back on English soil, at the club where he spent 10 years before an emotional farewell in May. But his Etihad Stadium return lasted 26 minutes before he was substituted following a red card for team-mate Giovanni Di Lorenzo and City wound up a comfortable winner thanks to second-half goals from Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku.
Haaland’s header put him on 50 goals in 49 Cham­pions League appea­rances, with the Norway striker reaching that milestone quic­­ker than any other pla­yer in the competition’s history.
The third consecutive evening of action in the first round of games in this season’s league phase also saw Eintracht Frankfurt, Sporting Lisbon and Club Brugge record big wins while FC Copenhagen held Bayer Leverkusen.
England coach Thomas Tuchel was in the stands of a raucous St. James’ Park to witness Rashford showcase his finishing abilities that United could do with right now.
Rashford was still looking for his first Barca goals and he got off the mark by heading in Jules Kounde’s cross in the 58th before he created space for himself with some clever footwork and blasted a ferocious right-footed shot from outside the area off the underside of the bar in the 67th.
Anthony Gordon pulled one back for Newcastle, putting in a low cross from substitute Jacob Murphy in the 89th, but Barca — beaten in the semi-finals last season — held on to claim their first three points of the campaign.
Pep Guardiola’s City, the 2023 Champions League winners, got off to an ideal start too as they saw off Serie A champions Napoli at the Etihad Stadium.
The game was conditioned by the sending-off of Napoli captain Di Lorenzo, dismissed for wiping out Haaland as the Norwegian headed towards goal.
Napoli’s defensive reorganisation meant De Bruyne was sacrificed. Ever the team player, the Belgium playmaker took the decision well, jogging off to applause from a home crowd that once cheered his every assist and goal.
“It was the only option I could do,” Napoli coach Antonio Conte said. “I was really, really sorry for him.”

By the end of the game, City fans were chanting De Bruyne’s name, confident the three points were safe and their former hero — perhaps the club’s greatest-ever player — couldn’t hurt them.
“He’s a legend of the club,” City midfielder Phil Foden said. “I can’t thank him enough for what he has done.”
City’s undoubted star is now Haaland and the Norway striker has started the season in red-hot form, with his clever header in the 56th from Foden’s flick into the box making it 12 goals in seven matches for club and country.
“The numbers speak for themselves and how fortunate we are to have him,” Guardiola said of Haaland, who is 12th in the all-time Champions League scoring charts — barely over a third of the way to Cristiano Ronaldo’s record 141 goals. “Along with the two monsters of the past 15 to 20 years. Ronaldo and [Lionel] Messi, Erling is there. In terms of goals he is unbelievable.”
Doku added the second with a neat finish in the 65th as City laid down an early marker in Europe, leaving Napoli without a win in 13 visits to face English opposition in European competition.
Frankfurt hit five
Frankfurt were the night’s biggest winners as they beat Galatasaray 5-1, despite the Turkish visitors taking an early lead through Yunus Akgun at the Waldstadion.
A Davinson Sanchez own goal brought Frankfurt level on 37 minutes, before teenage Turkey midfielder Can Uzun fired in his first Champions League goal just before the break and another own goal from Wilfried Singo at a free-kick gave the Bundesliga side some breathing space.
Jonathan Burkardt’s deflected effort and Ansgar Knauff’s late strike wrapped up a comfortable night for the hosts.
Fellow Bundesliga side Leverkusen had to come from behind twice to snatch a point in a 2-2 draw away to Copenhagen in the Danish capital. A brilliant Alejandro Grimaldo free-kick cancelled out Jordan Larsson’s early opener for the hosts.
Young Brazilian forward Robert restored the hosts’ advantage in the 87th minute only for a Pantelis Hatzid­iakos own goal in stoppage time, deflecting the ball into his own net from substitute Claudio Echeverri’s cross, to give Leverkusen a share of the spoils.
Club Brugge, who reached the last 16 last season, claimed a stunning 4-1 win at home to Monaco in Belgium, with an early penalty miss by Maghnes Akliouche for the visitors proving crucial.
The Belgians struck three goals in the space of 10 minutes shortly before half-time through Nicolo Tresoldi, Raphael Onye­dika and Hans Vanaken.
French 19-year-old forward Mamadou Diakhon lashed in a fourth with 15 minutes left, before Ansu Fati, making his Monaco debut, scored a late consolation.
Kairat Almaty, the tournament newcomers from Kazakhstan, made what is thought to be longest ever trek for a Champions League fixture — across three time zones and more than 7,000 kilometres — and lost 4-1 at Portuguese champions Sporting.
Kairat, who beat Celtic in the play-offs, had seen 18-year-old goalkeeper Sherkhan Kalmurza save an early penalty from Morten Hjulmand.
Sporting, though, went ahead just before half-time through Francisco Trinccao, who then fired in another after 65 minutes before Alisson Santos and Geovany Quenda also struck in quick succession.
Edmilson pulled one back for Kairat, who host Real Madrid next in a fortnight.

In addition, the police have also sought land for five more stations.
Sources in the police told Dawn that in a recent meeting, the Interior Ministry asked the CDA to provide plots for police stations that were either built on green belts, operating in rented buildings, located outside their jurisdiction, or functioning from within other police stations’ premises.
The meeting was attended by senior officials of the ministry, CDA and police, including Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi. A decision was taken to shift police stations from green belts, rented buildings, out-of-jurisdiction areas, and shared facilities.

Islamabad police seek more land for another five police stations

In response, the CDA sought time from the interior ministry after being directed to allocate suitable plots for police stations within days.
The police requested that the land be allotted within their respective jurisdictions, in easily accessible locations along main roads. They emphasised that police movement and the mobility of police vehicles should be unhindered.
Separate police teams were formed to survey the city and identify suitable land for police stations. On the recommendations of these teams, sites were proposed to the CDA for allocation.
According to police sources, the buildings of Koral, Kirpa, Khanna, Humak and Banigala police stations are located on green belts. Shamas Colony police station operates from a rented building, while Phulgran police station functions from within the Barakahu police station.
Nilore and Lohibher police stations are housed in old choki buildings, while Sangjani station is operating under makeshift arrangements along the N-5.
So far, the CDA has allotted land for Phulgran, Sangjani, Banigala, Shams Colony and Nilore police stations. Land for Phulgran has been allocated at Green Enclave-I, Sangjani at N-5, Banigala at Margalla Enclave, Shams Colony at I-12 Markaz, and Nilore at Lethrar Road.
Police teams also surveyed sites for Khanna, Kirpa, Koral, Humak and Lohibher police stations, later proposing land to the CDA. They requested land for Khanna at Rehman Enclave, Kirpa at Gulberg Residencies, Koral at Gulberg Green and Lohibher at Capital Enclave.
The CDA will construct the new police stations for the capital police.
The authority has also invited electronic bids for the construction of Humak, Lohibher, Kirpa, Nilore, Koral, Shams Colony, Sangjani and Phulgran police stations. A sum of Rs95.196 million has been reserved for the construction of each station.
Meanwhile, construction of the Golra and Women’s police stations is already underway. The Golra station is being built within the premises of the existing facility, while the Women police station is being constructed in G-7 Markaz, near the old building.
Renovation work has also begun at Aabpara, Margalla, Tarnol, Shalimar, Sumbal, Kohsar, Karachi Company, Ramna, Secretariat, Noon, Sabzi Mandi, Sihala, Barakahu and Shahzad Town police stations.
AIG Logistics, SSP Law and Order, SSP Operations, SP City, SP Dolphin and Patrolling, SP Saddar, SP Security and Discipline, SP I Area, SP Soan and SP Rural have been appointed to monitor the quality and progress of both the renovation and construction work.

This was stated by MPA Mir Nadir Magsi, who is considered to be an expert in flood-fighting and has been assigned to oversee strengthening of different dykes within the Indus course across Northern Dadu Division.
“At this moment, flows from [Guddu and Sukkur barrages] at peak at Moria Loop Bund — one of the most vulnerable to erosion dykes in the region. By tonight or tomorrow, floodwater will start receding,” he told Dawn on Friday evening while supervising the ongoing strengthening work at the bund.

Expert in flood-fighting, MPA Nadir Magsi wants government to do more for safe passage of deluges; says round-the-clock monitoring underway at many dykes

“We are standing on the ‘highly sensitive’ Moria Loop Bund on the right side. In the recent past, floodwater used to flow straight downwards from the spur of this dyke, but now it turns around in a loop and comes back. So, stones are being stocked here. That’s why [more] work on the protective bund is essential, coupled with strict vigilance,” he said.
In reply to a question, he said water has to pass through all three bridges — Larkana-Khairpur, Dadu-Moro and Amri-Sehwan — “but the question is how much damage the floodwater can cause to dykes and bridges“.
“At present, the quantum of floodwater, equal to five days’ flow, is entering the river in 20 days; clearly, there is an obstruction,” he said.
“These bridges have been built, and whatever civil engineers have done, they have done, but floodwater always mounts immense pressure on dykes. This issue must be addressed,” he said.
Remedial measures suggested
MPA Magsi said that if open culverts are built on the roads over the embankments on the other side (left side), then the water will automatically rise and pass through, even if a road is above it. And if the water level is low, it will not cross. Roads should be built with culverts, so there will be no backflow of water, he said. He said the water must be given a passage, and the bridges should be reviewed.
“For this, I will take a paper to President [Asif Ali Zardari] about these bridges, because even the president’s own district, Nawabshah, has been affected by the Amri Bridge,” he said.
The MPA said it is not possible to build bridges between each embankment because this would involve a hefty amount of money. Therefore, funds should be allocated in the Annual Development Programme for culverts, so that flows of 20,000 or 40,000 cusecs can pass safely.
Position of bridges
MPA Magsi was briefed at the site by the chief engineer, superintending engineer and executive engineers with the help of maps and satellite images. They showed him that all three bridges were of small length as compared to the width of the river at these points.
The Larkana-Khairpur Bridge is just 1.2 kilometres long, as against the river’s width of 13 kilometres at this point. The engineers said that due to the narrow passage, floodwater naturally exerts pressure in the shape of backflow on dykes.
Flood situation
They said the peak flow would safely pass through Larkana within the next 24 hours, adding that dykes stood intact. The chief engineer right bank, sharing the current flows in the Indus, said that Guddu Barrage was in low flood now with an inflow of 376,300 cusecs and outflow of 347,969 cusecs.
The inflow at Sukkur Barrage is 482,090 cusecs and outflow 428,710 cusecs while the inflow at Kotri Barrage is 328,142 cusecs and outflow 306,887 cusecs.
He said Sukkur and Kotri barrages are in medium flood at the moment.
Flood peak causes damage
The peak of flood is currently passing through the dykes falling within the jurisdiction of Northern Dadu Division and mounting pressure on Moria, Hakra and Abad dykes — located in Larkana district.
The irrigation officials posted at the Moria Loop Bund told Dawn on Friday that it had caused damage to a portion of T-Spur, developing a situation that had prompted them to construct a stud in the downstream close to that T-Spur. They had started dumping heavy stones to urgently build it so as to remain on the safe side in case any more harm is done to the existing spur.
The Chief Engineer of Right Bank Mukhtiar Abro, Superintendent Engineer Northern Dadu Division and a host of other irrigation officials were present at the dyke to monitor the situation.

The accused was presented before a court, which granted four days’ physical remand on Friday for further investigation.
The remand was approved on the police’s request after the court expressed satisfaction that more inquiry was required in the sensitive case.
A police spokesman said a shroud was found near the grave of the girl in the last week of August. Following the discovery, Dhamial police launched an investigation and arrested the suspect accused of desecrating the grave. According to initial findings, the suspect dug up the grave for witchcraft purposes and then attempted to cover it again.
Police immediately responded to the information and had the grave exhumed. No direct evidence of desecration of the body was initially observed. However, forensic reports are awaited for a conclusive determination. Samples were collected during the exhumation, the spokesman added.
The arrest posed a challenge, for which special teams were formed. Police said they worked tirelessly using technical and human intelligence to trace the suspect. Once forensic reports are received, the accused will be charged with solid evidence, and all legal formalities will be completed to ensure punishment for the crime.
A medical board, accompanied by a judicial magistrate, conducted the exhumation of the girl’s grave in Girja Road graveyard. The girl had been buried three days earlier. Samples from her body were collected for DNA and forensic analysis.
Police confirmed that no signs of violence or injuries were found on the body. Nevertheless, a case was registered for desecration of the grave and tampering with the remains.
Zafar Iqbal, father of the girl, lodged the initial complaint. He stated that his daughter died on August 26.
When he visited the grave the following morning for fateha, he found the grave disturbed and the shroud lying in a nearby mansion.
Upon receiving the report, City Police Officer Khalid Hamdani ordered legal action, considering all aspects of the case. Police later sought court approval for exhumation and the appointment of a medical board to establish facts without disturbing the grave unnecessarily.
When exhumation began, the girl’s head and parts of her body became visible, as though the soil had been filled hastily. Her lower torso remained under stone slabs, and the body was without a shroud. According to sources, decomposition had already begun as the body had been buried for three days. Samples were collected before the body was reburied.
A senior police official said the exhumation and postmortem were completed, with tissues and samples sent to the Forensic Science Agency for DNA and other tests. He confirmed that the grave had indeed been tampered with, and a case was registered against unidentified suspects.
As the investigation progressed, police traced the suspect, who turned out to be a black magic practitioner from Mansehra. He was arrested and remanded into custody for four days to aid further investigation.

Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Muhammad Yousuf Malik found Muhammad Sajid guilty of the offence and sentenced him to 14 years in prison for throwing acid on his wife, Saima Bibi, who had suffered 22 per cent burn injuries, and an additional 10 years for trying to kill her.
“It has been established that the accused committed offence of throwing acid upon an innocent lady without any justification,” the court remarked.
According to state prosecutor Ayesha Saeed, the couple had been married for 12 years, but the woman had been living with her parents along with her three children for the past two-and-a-half years as her husband, who was a drug addict, used to beat her.
In her testimony before the court, the acid attack survivor stated that on the day of the incident, she was at her parents’ house when, at around 8pm, her husband arrived, suddenly threw acid on her and fled.
Subsequently, her brother and mother shifted her to a hospital, where she recorded her statement and nominated her husband for the offence.
During the trial, the defence counsel contended that the accused was falsely implicated in the case. Claiming that the brother of the woman had thrown acid, he also argued that the prosecution failed to produce independent witnesses in the case.
But the court rejected the defence plea and noted that the accused failed to produce substantial evidence in support of his claim.
It added that the incident had taken place inside the house; therefore, the family members who were present and saw the incident came forward and recorded their statements in support of the victim.
A case was registered at the Defence police station under Section 324 (attempted murder) and 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

• Moot demands protection of Karachi villages, remaining agriculture field
KARACHI: Climate change experts and members of civil society on Friday called for the immediate restoration and clearing of the city’s natural waterways and warned that continued neglect in this matter could lead to more frequent and severe urban flooding in the city, as seen during recent rains.
This was the gist of a session titled ‘Obstacles to Karachi’s Natural Waterways and Potential Threats’ held at the Karachi Press Club.
The speakers also highlighted that housing societies built on natural waterways like Saadi Town and Saadi Garden, along with projects near the Malir Expressway, also known as Shahrah-i-Bhutto, are environmentally unfriendly.
They also pointed out that hill torrents from the Kirthar range swelled the Lyari and Malir rivers, and stressed the need to remove all blockages and encroachments in these areas to ensure a smooth water flow.
Speaking on the occasion, urban planner Muhammad Toheed said that climate change is now an undeniable reality, and while countries around the world have upgraded their drainage and infrastructure systems in response, Karachi continues to lag far behind.
“Environmental and climate-related issues are nowhere on our list of priorities,” he said, adding that despite Pakistan being among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the issue is still not treated with the urgency it deserves.
He pointed out that Karachi suffers from a lack of proper planning and coordination among civic bodies. There is no significant progress in road engineering or drainage infrastructure. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation must also be held accountable, he said and highlighted that contractors often build roads without engineering supervision, which results in poorly designed surfaces that cause water accumulation and the formation of low-lying flood-prone areas.
Mr Toheed further criticised the discharge of sewage into stormwater drains by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation.
“This is a disaster. Now we can’t even tell the difference between a sewerage line and a storm water drain,” he said. “The city’s sewerage system has collapsed, with sewage stagnating in several areas even in the absence of rainfall.”
He stressed the urgent need to restore and separate the city’s drainage and sewerage infrastructure to prevent further deterioration.
‘Poor urban planning destroys Malir’s agricultural land’
Agriculturist Azeem Dehqan said that Karachiites should learn about the city’s history, adding that saving the metropolis from its ongoing crises is a moral responsibility shared by all citizens.
He pointed out that Malir and its surrounding areas were once fertile agricultural lands where crops, fruits and vegetables were widely grown, but this productivity has declined significantly over the years due to poor urban planning and the rise of housing societies and development projects that are not environmentally friendly.
Similarly, author Ramzan Baloch said that Malir once had clean drinking water and was known for producing high-quality crops, but over the years, the area has suffered severe degradation of its natural resources.
 
 

He also lamented that the people have no interest in environmental issues, which is one of the main reasons for the lack of practical action on climate-related challenges in Pakistan.
Mr Baloch also blamed those in power for the city’s current crises and said that it is the responsibility of the rulers to address these problems, but they have failed to take meaningful action.
Social activist Bashir Baloch said large volumes of rainwater flow from the Kirthar range into the Lyari and Malir rivers. Therefore, authorities need to remove all blockages and encroachments in these areas to ensure proper water flow and prevent future disasters.
He cited a historical example and pointed out that the British had once constructed a railway bridge over the Malir River, which was later washed away by heavy rains due to the large volume of water flowing through the river. Something similar had happened during the current rains, he added.
He also criticised the mayor and claimed that he lacked a proper understanding of the city’s geography and its natural water channels, as evident from his recent media briefings.
Climate activist Yasir Darya said that due to climate change, weather patterns have become increasingly unpredictable, which has disrupted the natural cycle of seasons. He added that even weather experts are now struggling to accurately forecast conditions beyond a few days. In such a situation, he stressed, better urban planning is urgently needed in Karachi to prepare for and adapt to these changes.
Resolution
A resolution presented during the session called for the restoration and clearing of Karachi’s natural waterways and sewerage system.
It also demanded the protection of remaining agricultural land, the formulation of relevant laws and the treatment of sewage for agricultural use.
The resolution further emphasised the need to protect the villages within Karachi’s limits.
Lawyers Abeera Ashfaque, Kazim Mahesar and others also spoke on the occasion.

The Wall Street Journal reported the potential helicopter and vehicle sales on Friday.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news of the proposed sale came days before world leaders were set to gather in New York for the annual  United Nations General Assembly next week, while the UN Security Council is also due to hold a high-level meeting on Gaza.
The planned package includes a deal worth $3.8bn for 30 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and $1.9bn for 3,250 infantry assault vehicles for the Israeli army. Another $750 million worth of support parts for armoured personnel carriers and power supplies are also working its way through the sale process.
The Republican president’s full-throated support for Israel’s military contrasts with growing wariness about Israel’s assault on Gaza among Democrats.
On Thursday, a group of senators introduced the first Senate resolution to urge recognition of a Palestinian state and more than half of Democrats in the Senate recently voted against further arms sales.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return flight to Washington, Trump branded Khan as “one of the worst mayors in the world”, accusing him of failing on crime and immigration. 
“I asked that he not be there. He wanted to be there, as I understand. I didn’t want him,” the president said.
The mayor did not attend the banquet and was not expecting an invitation, according to British media. A source close to Sadiq Khan dismissed Mr Trump’s remarks, saying his “politics is one of fear and division”. He claimed London remains “a global success story” that attracts record numbers of Americans.

“At 1am this morning, a heavily armed raiding party of ICT police from Secretariat thana (police station) surrounded my home and asked for Imaan and Hadi. They were not there, and we informed them of the same. Cops said they had an FIR (first information report) against them and they should report to the thana. Eventually they left,” she posted on X.
 






In a subsequent post, she referred to a protest at the Islamabad High Court yesterday, where Imaan — who is a lawyer and rights activist — and others had raised slogans in support of judicial independence.
The lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
Isl­a­mabad Bar Council member Ale­­em Abbasi, ex-president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Riasat Ali and Imaan were prominent among the demonstrators.
However, tensions flared when — after the demonstration — PTI-affiliated lawyers, including Intizar Hussain Panjotha, Naeem Panjotha, and Fatehullah Barki, confronted IHCBA President Wa­­j­id Ali Gilani. Witnesses reported the PTI lawyers pushed Gilani, leading to an altercation, before IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jaja and other lawyers intervened.
 






The IHCBA president, accompanied by the secretary and bar council Vice Chairman Naseer Ahmed Kayani, later condemned the incident and announced that a reference would be sent to the bar council seeking the registration of a terrorism case against the lawyers concerned, as well as the cancellation of their licences.
He alleged that a group of lawyers, including Imaan, physically assaulted him, dragged him, and branded him a traitor. Gilani further claimed that they were armed and pressured him to support demands for filing cases against PTI foun­der Imran Khan, which he refu­sed. Jaja also claimed that the protest had been held without a formal requisition to the bar, in violation of due procedure.
Subsequently, police booked Imaan, Hadi and several PTI-linked lawyers under anti-terror laws.
Referring to the episode, Shireen Mazari posted on X that “all videos of the IHC protest yesterday show clearly the FIR charges are absolutely false. Eye witness accounts reveal the same. But persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state.”

Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu told the committee that the case had been under review for 18 months due to its complex nature. He added that untimely responses from PTCL management partly caused delays.
Committee Chairperson Senator Palwasha Khan raised concerns about appointments to the boards of PTCL and its subsidiary Ufone, noting that while PTCL board details were available online, Ufone’s board composition was missing from its website. She said the names had also not been shared in previous meetings.
Senator Kamran Murtaza questioned the perks and privileges enjoyed by board members, including reports of $5,000 allowances and foreign trips. “This is public information and should be disclosed,” Senator Khan remarked.
Stolen data
Meanwhile, Senator Afnan Ullah revealed that stolen data worth over Rs65bn is being sold on the dark web, including the personal information of nearly 300,000 Haj applicants.
He warned of external pressure on Pakistan not to legislate data protection laws and urged urgent action to avoid serious consequences.
 
 

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman confirmed that SIM data, including his own, had been circulating on the dark web since 2022. He also acknowledged poor telecom service in Balochistan and widespread call drop issues.
Senators criticised IT Minister Shaza Fatima for her repeated absence from committee proceedings, questioning the ministry’s commitment to addressing sectoral issues.

Committee flags delays, lapses in telecom sector oversight

Senator Nadeem Bhutto highlighted the lack of mobile signals in several areas, including the Karachi–Sukkur Motorway.The PTA informed the committee that it was prepared to proceed with a 5G auction in December, with consultant reports completed. However, pending court cases could delay the process. The committee urged the ministry to coordinate with the Attorney General’s office to resolve legal hurdles promptly.

The new measure, which could likely face legal challenges, was announced alongside the introduction of a $1 million “gold card“ residency programme that Trump had previewed months earlier.
“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” Trump told reporters as he signed the orders in the Oval Office.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the recipients.
Large technology firms rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.
Tech entrepreneurs — including Trump’s former ally Elon Musk — have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the United States does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.
“All the big companies are on board,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump in the Oval Office.
Trump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, but faced court challenges to his earlier approach, which targeted the types of jobs that qualify. The current iteration has become the latest move in the major immigration crackdown of his second term.
According to Trump’s order, the fee will be required for those seeking to enter the country beginning Sunday, with the Homeland Security secretary able to exempt individuals, entire companies, or entire industries.
The order expires in a year, though Trump can extend it.
The number of H-1B visa applications has risen sharply in recent years, with a peak in approvals in 2022 under then-president Joe Biden.
In contrast, the peak in rejections was recorded in 2018, during Trump’s first term in the White House.
The United States approved approximately 400,000 H-1B visas in 2024, two-thirds of which were renewals.
Trump also signed an order creating a new expedited pathway to US residency for people who pay $1 million, or for corporate sponsors to pay $2 million.
“I think it’s going to be tremendously successful,” Trump added.</p><small>2025-09-20 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20103608738c12f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943333/75-killed-in-attack-on-mosque-in-key-darfur-city' target='_blank'><strong>75 killed in attack on mosque in key Darfur city</strong></a><br><p>PORT SUDAN: Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Sup­port Forces (RSF) killed 75 people in a drone strike on a mosque on Friday as they pressed their assault on the Darfur city of El-Fasher.
El-Fasher is the last major city in the vast western region still under regular army control and the RSF has laid siege to it since May last year.
The drone strike struck worshippers in the city’’ Al Daraja neighbourhood, where fleeing residents of the city’s famine-hit Abu Shouk displaced persons’ camp had sought refuge from the RSF advance.
“The bodies were retrieved from the rubble of the mosque,” said a post from a rescue agency one of hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating relief across Sudan.
The RSF has been locked in a devastating war with the regular army since April 2023.
The UN human rights office said it was concerned there may have been ethnically-motivated killings of the sort that have increasingly accompanied the fighting with a “devastating impact on the civilian population”.
Residents of Al Daraja combed through the wreckage to find and bury the dead, but said they had run out of shrouds for the bodies. “We had to use plastic bags,” one resident said, using a satellite internet connection to circumvent a communications blackout.
“There are no more shrouds in the city after all this siege and death,” he said.
The RSF’s siege has caused mass hunger in the city, where families have been surviving on animal feed for months.
Key base falls to RSF
Satellite imagery released by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing on multiple fronts, including around Abu Shouk camp and the former UN-African Union peacekeeping base.
 
 

The base has since been used by the Joint Forces, an alliance of armed groups which has fought alongside the military since late 2023 against RSF fighters.
The alliance has been key to the city’s defences. The city’s largest ethnic group, the Zaghawa, see the RSF as an existential threat.

• Trump hails progress with his Chinese counterpart including on selling TikTok
WASHINGTON: Chinese leader Xi Jinping asked US President Donald Trump to avoid  “unilateral trade decisions” during a phone call on Friday that also included discussion on TikTok, state  media in Beijing said.
“The US side should avoid taking unilateral trade-restrictive  measures that could undermine the outcomes achieved through multiple  rounds of consultations,” Xi reportedly told Trump in a call that the Chinese leader described as  “positive and constructive”.
Meanwhile, US president hailed what he called progress with Chinese president including on selling blockbuster app TikTok and said he would  visit the Asian power, which offered a more cautious assessment of their  talks.
 
 

The leaders of the world’s two largest economies spoke by telephone for the second time since the return to the White House of Trump, who  has tried to keep a lid on tensions despite his once virulent criticism  of China.
Trump told reporters ahead of the call that he hoped it would finalise a deal to take out of Chinese hands TikTok, the social media  hugely popular with young Americans that the Republican mogul has turned  to himself to garner support.
Neither side reported a final agreement but Trump said the call was  “very productive”.
“We made progress on many very important issues  including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and  Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote on  his Truth Social platform.
He said he would meet Xi on the  sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in South  Korea starting at the end of next month and that he would travel to  China next year.
Trump said Xi would also visit the United States at an unspecified time and that the two leaders would speak again by telephone.
 


‘Market rules’
“On the TikTok issue, Xi noted that  China’s position is clear: the Chinese government respects the will of  enterprises and welcomes them to conduct business negotiations based on  market rules, to reach solutions that balance interests and comply with  Chinese laws and regulations,” state broadcaster CCTV said.
“China hopes the US side will provide an open, fair, and  non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing  in the United States.”
It described the call as “frank and in-depth.”
The US Congress last year during Joe Biden’s presidency passed a law to  force TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell its US operations for  national security reasons or face the ban of the app.
US policymakers, including in Trump’s first term, have warned that  China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on  what they see on social media.
But Trump, an avid social media user, on Tuesday once again put off a  ban of the app, which he has credited as a factor helping him win the  2024 election.
 
 

Trump told reporters on Thursday that under an upcoming deal  TikTok’s US business would be  “owned by all American investors, and  very rich people and companies.”
The Wall Street Journal raised the possibility of a consortium to control TikTok that would include tech  giant Oracle and two California investment funds — Silver Lake and  Andreessen Horowitz.
Oracle owner Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people, is a  supporter of Trump, meaning TikTok would be the latest media or social  media app to come under the control or influence of the president.
Tariff truce
Trump while on the campaign trail bashed China  relentlessly as an enemy but since returning to office has spoken of his  strong relationship with Xi.
Both sides dramatically hiked tariffs against each other during a  months-long dispute earlier this year, disrupting global supply chains.
Washington and Beijing then reached a deal to reduce levies, which  expires in November, with the United States imposing 30 percent duties  on imports of Chinese goods and China hitting US products with a 10  percent tariff.
 
 

The phone meeting comes after Xi organised a major summit this month with the leaders of Russia and India — and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to observe a major  military parade in Beijing to mark the end of World War II.
Trump accused China and Russia of conspiring against the United States.
Xi, in the Chinese social media readout, voiced appreciation for the US role in World War II.

• FO adopts cautious approach; cites ‘evolving doctrine’ but offers no specifics
• Dar hints other states also interested in defence deals
ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s conflicting statements about Pakistan’s new defence agreement with Saudi Arabia have intensified speculation about the pact’s nuclear dimension.
During an appearance on a TV talk show on Thursday night, Mr Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework.
“What we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to (Saudi Arabia) according to this agreement,” he said, stressing that Pakistan has always acted as a responsible nuclear state.
The remarks were interpreted as the first explicit signal that Pakistan might extend its nuclear deterrence to the kingdom, particularly as Mr Asif was present at the signing ceremony in Riyadh.
However, in a subsequent interview with Reuters, the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
 
 

Amid the confusion, the Foreign Office on Friday seemed to choose ‘strategic silence’, adopting a cautious approach.
At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan sidestepped repeated questions on whether the pact alters Pakistan’s long-declared policy of keeping its nuclear deterrent India-centric, and not extending it to another country.
Asked twice whether that stance had changed, Mr Khan only referred to an evolving doctrine. “The doctrine has evolved and continues to do so,” he said. “I am not here to comment on the specificity of the doctrine, but our position is well known.”
Pakistan has consistently declared its nuclear programme is intended to deter India alone.
In Dec, the Foreign Office said: “Pakistan has made it abundantly clear that our strategic programme and allied capabilities are solely meant to deter and thwart a clear and visible existential threat from our neighbourhood and should not be perceived as a threat to any other country.”
Mr Khan, while parrying question about whether rules of engagement related to troop deployment in Saudi Arabia have been revised, framed the agreement as a consolidation of longstanding ties with Riyadh.
 
 

“Since the 1960s, defence cooperation has served as one of the principal pillars of Pakistan-Saudi Arabia’s all-encompassing bilateral relations,” Mr Khan said. “The strategic mutual defence agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership.”
When asked if the agreement was aimed to check Israel’s aggressive designs in the region, he said, “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
Speculation about extended deterrence was first sparked by a Saudi official who, shortly after the agreement was signed, hinted to a Western news agency that Riyadh would under the agreement get nuclear cover. Saudi commentators later amplified the claim.
The joint statement that announced the accord, formally titled the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, described it as an initiative “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression”.
Other states ‘interested’: Dar
Separately, speaking to reports in London, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar hinted that some other states were also showing an interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Mr Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”

The resolution was adopted with 145 votes in favour, five against — including the United States and Israel — and six abstentions.
Four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — Britain, China, France, and Russia — supported the resolution. Several close US allies, including Germany, Belgium, and Saudi Arabia, also voted in favour.
The move followed Washington’s decision to deny or revoke visas for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and nearly 80 other senior officials, blocking them from attending the UNGA in New York. However, Palestine will be represented in the chamber by its UN ambassador.
 







Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to address via video link; nearly dozen states expected to recognise Palestinian state next week

In response, the UNGA voted to allow President Abbas to address next week’s high-level meeting by video link.
Defending the decision, the US State Department said: “It is in our national security interests to impose consequences and hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments and undermining the prospects for peace.”
The Palestinian presidency sharply criticised the measure, saying it was “astonished by the visa decision, which contradicts international law, specifically the Headquarters Agreement between the United Nations and the United States, which prohibits preventing any delegation from access.”
 
 

The resolution ensures Palestine’s “meaningful participation” by allowing its president or senior representatives to deliver pre-recorded statements during the general debate, high-level conferences, and other UN meetings.
Saudi Arabia and France will co-chair meetings from Monday on the Israeli and Palestinian two-state solution, which aims to see both sides existing alongside one another in peace.
About 10 countries, including France, Australia, Belgium, Britain and Canada are expected to formally recognise an independent Palestinian, after the overwhelming adoption last week by the General Assembly of a text supporting a future Palestinian state – albeit without Hamas.
The countries say these moves are intended to put pressure on Israel to end its devastating assault on Gaza, curtail the building of new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and recommit to a peace process with the Palestinians.
But the countries planning to recognise a Palestinian state have not said what difference that would make to their diplomatic representation.
French President Emmanuel Macron, the first leader of a major Western power to endorse recognition, said the move would be accompanied by a commitment by the PA to enact reforms, which would improve Palestinian governance and make it a more credible partner for the post-war administration of Gaza.
 
 

All eyes will be on US President Donald Trump who has initiated massive cuts to US foreign aid since his return to the White House, hammering UN agencies as humanitarian needs grow.
Israel’s main ally has long said it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only after the Palestinians agree with Israel on a “two-state solution”.
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa will be a prominent new addition to the gathering, which also includes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
On Wednesday, UN chief Antonio Guterres and Brazil’s Lula will organise a climate summit on Wednesday where some states may announce new goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, just weeks ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

According to the PTI news agency, ICC chief executive Sanjog Gupta wrote a ‘strongly-worded email’ to the PCB on Thursday, terming the use of a mobile phone to film the conversation inside the Players and Match Officials Area (PMOA) a breach of protocol.
The meeting was attended by Pycroft, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha, head coach Mike Hesson, team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, media manager Naeem Gillani, and ICC general manager cricket Wasim Khan.
 






Gillani was initially told by ICC officials that mobile phones were not permitted inside the PMOA under anti-corruption regulations.
However, the PCB insisted that the meeting be recorded, even threatening that Pakistan would not take the field against the UAE unless their demand was met. A compromise was reached under which the session was filmed without audio.
In his email, Gupta described the episode as “misconduct” and said the PCB had committed “multiple violations” of the PMOA code. He also objected to a PCB press release which had claimed Pycroft had “apologised” to the Pakistan captain and manager.
Gupta clarified that the referee had only expressed “regret over the miscommunication” that led to Suryakumar not shaking hands with Salman before the India-Pakistan clash.
The controversy delayed the start of Pakistan’s game against the UAE by nearly an hour, with the PCB initially instructing its players to remain at the hotel after learning Pycroft would officiate.
The standoff was broken after the ICC agreed to the pre-match meeting between the referee and the Pakistan team management.
 
 

The PCB had earlier demanded Pycroft’s removal from the tournament, accusing him of violating the code of conduct and the MCC’s spirit of cricket by instructing Salman not to shake hands with Suryakumar.
The ICC, however, said Pycroft was only relaying a message from the Asian Cricket Council’s venue manager and that an internal inquiry had cleared him of any wrongdoing.
Later on Friday, however, the PCB defended its decision to record the Dubai meeting, maintaining that its media manager had authorised access to the PMOA and acted within ICC protocols.
“The team’s media manager is part of the squad and has authorised access to the PMOA. His presence there is not a violation,” the PTI quoted “a tournament source” as saying. The board further argued that protocols allow media managers to use cameras inside the PMOA.
However, PTI claimed the matter was flagged by the ICC referee to Pakistan’s anti-corruption officer, who acknowledged the breach. Gupta, in his email, was categorical: “The ICC, in order to preserve the interest of the sport, the tournament and the stakeholders involved accepted PCB’s request although this demonstrated a complete disregard for the sanctity of the PMOA.”</p><small>2025-09-20 03:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20081345f7ada3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943349/bid-to-lift-unsc-nuclear-sanctions-on-iran-fails-to-pass' target='_blank'><strong>Bid to lift UNSC nuclear sanctions on Iran fails to pass</strong></a><br><p> 

Amir Saeid Iravani

• Russia, China, Pakistan and Algeria vote in favour; nine against; two abstentions
• Islamabad urges peaceful resolution, more time for diplomacy, and preservation of JCPOA framework
• Iran says council decision ‘weakens diplomacy’, but leaves door open for talks
UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council did not adopt a draft resolution on Friday to permanently lift sanctions on Iran, but Tehran and key European powers still have eight days to try and agree to a delay.
The 15-member UN Security Council was required to vote on the draft resolution on Friday after Britain, France and Germany launched a 30-day process on August 28 to reimpose UN sanctions, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers that aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies having any such intention.
Russia, China, Pakistan and Algeria voted in favour of the draft text on Friday. Nine members voted against and two abstained.
 






Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, in a statement, said Islamabad believes that all issues concerning Iran’s nuclear programme must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and cooperation. He stressed the need to allow more time for diplomacy to succeed.
He emphasised the imperative of avoiding any confrontation that could further complicate the situation.
Mr Ahmad said that Pakistan stresses the importance of preserving the framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and Resolution 2231 as the basis for reaching an amicable solution, without resorting to coercive measures, until a successor arrangement or ‘new deal’ is achieved.”
The Security Council vote has now set up a week of intense diplomacy while world leaders — including Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian — are in New York for the annual high-level UN General Assembly.
 






‘Weakens diplomacy’
“The door for diplomacy is not closed, but it will be Iran, not adversaries, who decide with whom and on what basis to engage,” Iran’s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told reporters after the vote.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet with his European counterparts in New York next week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, he said, adding that Friday’s divided vote showed there was “no consensus in the council”.
“This decision weakens diplomacy and risks dangerous consequences for non-proliferation,” Irav­ani said.
Britain, France and Germany have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months — to allow space for talks on a long-term deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme — if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engages in talks with the United States.
“Without these most basic conditions being met, there is no clear path to a swift diplomatic solution,” Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council. “We are ready for further engagements, diplomatically, in the next week, and beyond to seek to resolve differences.”
Any delay on reimposing sanctions would require a Security Council resolution. If a deal on an extension can’t be reached by the end of September 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed.
‘US remains ready to engage’
Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea said that while the US voted “no” on Friday, it “does not impede the possibility of real diplomacy”, adding that a return of sanctions on Iran “does not preclude later removal through diplomacy”.
“More importantly, President Trump has continued to reiterate the United States ongoing readiness for meaningful, direct, and timebound dialogue with Iran be it prior to the conclusion of the snapback process on September 27, or after,” she told the council.

• Plan missile early warning system; joint drills
GULF Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have pledged sweeping steps to bolster collective defence, including plans to increase intelligence sharing, develop new missile warning systems, and hold joint defence drills, after Israel launched a deadly strike on Doha earlier this month.
Following an emergency Arab-Islamic summit, where leaders expressed alarm about Israel’s attacks across the Middle East, GCC officials met in Doha to discuss military intelligence unification, UAE-based The National reported.
The GCC — a political and economic alliance of six Middle Eastern nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — has agreed to expand intelligence sharing through Unified Military Command.
The six-member bloc said they would fast-track the creation of a regional early-warning system to counter ballistic missiles and share the “air situation” with all affected countries.
The measures will also see joint troops and command-centre drills within three months, to be followed by live air defence exercises, the statement said.
 
 

To address all risks and challenges, continuous efforts across military and intelligence sectors will be undertaken to enhance Gulf security cooperation and integrate the security systems, the statement added.
“The priority is ensuring the security, stability and safety of all GCC countries,” the council said, warning of the risks to a region already unsettled by months of conflict.
The decision comes days after Israel targeted a Hamas delegation in Doha that had been discussing ceasefire terms for the war in Gaza.
 
 

The strike killed five members of the Palestinian group, including the son of exiled political leader, alongside a Qatari security officer. Qatar said it had received no prior warning before the explosions erupted in its capital and Hamas said its senior leadership survived the attack
During the meeting, the council denounced Israeli strikes as a “dangerous and unacceptable” provocation.
Delegates in Doha included senior defence officials from all six Gulf states, with the Mohammed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of State for Defence Affairs; Bahrain’s Minister of Defence Affairs, Lt Gen Abdullah Al Nuaimi; Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Minister of Defence, Prince Abdulrahman bin Mohammed; Secretary General of the Oman’s Ministry of Defence, Mohammed Al Zaabi; Kuwait’s Minister of Defence Sheikh Abdullah Ali Al Abdullah Al Sabah; and Jasem Al Budaiwi.
The presence of all ministers underscored, officials said, the urgency of forging a common regional shield.
While the GCC has long spoken of greater military integration, efforts have often faltered amid political rivalries and divergent threat perceptions.
Thursday’s agreement, amid the gravity of Israel’s unprecedented strike inside Qatar, was presented as a turning point.

• Sutlej breach submerges 150 villages in Multan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur
• PDMA says monsoon ends; rivers across Punjab return to normal levels
• Gilani calls for BISP role in relief
LAHORE: The Punjab government will establish flood relief committees at district and tehsil levels to oversee aid and rehabilitation in areas devastated by recent floods.
“A survey form, a mobile application and a central monitoring dashboard will ensure effective aid distribution and oversight,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said while chairing a meeting on Friday.
She directed officials to initiate comprehensive rehabilitation efforts for affected families, ensure the immediate restoration of roads and bridges and devise simple, effective procedures for providing assistance.
The chief minister said the floods had impacted 3,775 villages across 64 tehsils in 27 districts, damaging more than 63,000 concrete houses and over 309,000 mud houses.
 
 

Survey teams comprising officials from the Urban Unit, Revenue Department, Agriculture Department and the Pakistan Army will collect data to ensure accurate assessments.
CM Maryam emphasised that no victim should be left without support. “We will compensate each individual for their losses so that no one is deprived of their rightful relief,” she said, directing the establishment of additional relief camps and distribution points.
Sutlej breach submerges villages
A devastating breach of the Sutlej River at Noraja Bhutta has intensified the crisis in south Punjab, inundating 150 more villages across Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts. Thousands have been displaced as floodwaters encroached on a 20-kilometre stretch near the Multan-Sukkur M-5 Motorway.
In Bahawalpur, villages including Nowshera Jadeed, Saadullahpur, Soiwala, Nai Basti and Basti Chakar were submerged. In Lodhran, Adam Wahan, Munshi Wala, Jhangra and Thali Wala were washed away.
 


Jalalpur Pirwala remains under water, with authorities reviewing a plan to breach the motorway to redirect floodwaters into the Chenab. A technical committee is expected to deliberate on the plan.
Multan Division Commissioner Amir Karim Khan visited Jalalpur Pirwala to supervise rescue and relief operations. He inspected the damaged motorway section, where National Highway Authority officials briefed him on ongoing repair work using heavy machinery.
Motorway police spokesperson Imran Shah said the M-5 was closed due to flooding, with diversions set up for travellers. Alternate routes through the national highway from Shah Shams and Uch Sharif interchanges were being provided.
Fatalities, losses
Punjab Disaster Manage­ment Aut­hority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the death toll in Punjab had reached 123. Speaking at a press conference, he noted that floodwaters were receding in several areas, with boat operations discontinued as water levels dropped.
He confirmed the end of the monsoon season and said all rivers had returned to normal levels, except for a slightly higher flow in the Sutlej.
However, water remains on 10-12 kilometres of the M-5 motorway, keeping a 22-kilometre section closed.
He stated that water from the Indus River did not cause any problems. “A breached section of the bridge has been filled in,” Mr Kathia said.
A report from the South Punjab Secretariat confirmed large-scale hu­­man and material losses, including 45 deaths. Around 1.17 million people were affected and 1,112 villages inundated. Floods also damaged 1.17m acres of farmland and destroyed crops on 1.25m acres.
Relief efforts include 1,145 camps providing food, medicine and other essentials. More than 1.5m people and 1.47m livestock have been evacuated. Medical treatment has been provided to 451,978 people, and 848,119 animals have been treated.
BISP relief
Earlier, PPP’s Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani visited Jalalpur Pirwala and reviewed the flood situation.
Speaking to the media, he said that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has demanded that flood victims be assisted through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
He held a meeting with Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah two days ago and discussed political matters and flood-affected areas.
 






He said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari had stressed BISP’s role in relief efforts while Rana Sanaullah was of the view that assistance to flood-affected people would be conducted through other programmes.
Mr Gilani urged the government to reconsider their decision to help flood-affected people from other programmes and said that the flood victims’ families should be supported via the BISP.

• Non-compliant individuals to be treated as abettors, facilitators
QUETTA: The Balochistan government has directed families to immediately report if any of their relatives go missing or join non-state or militant groups, warning that strict legal action will be taken against those who fail to comply.
According to an official notification issued by the Home Department, families are required to provide such information within seven days and submit sworn declarations disowning relatives involved in militancy, or else face action under anti-terrorism laws.
The notification stated that citizens, parents and guardians must inform the nearest police station and FC/army unit within one week if a family member goes missing or is found to have joined any non-state or militant group.
It further directed that details of individuals already missing must also be submitted within seven days under Sections 118 and 202 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), read with Section 11(1)(EEE) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997.
Similarly, families of those who have already joined militant outfits must file a sworn affidavit of separation and disownment within a week, in line with sections 120/120-A of the PPC, read with Section 11(1)(a)(EEE) of the ATA.
 
 

The notification warned that if families fail to report missing persons or refuse to disown them, and it is later established that the individual was involved in terrorism, the family will be treated as abettors/facilitators under the ATA. Their names may also be placed in the Fourth Schedule under sections 107, 109 and 114 of the PPC, read with ATA provisions.
The Home Department warned that facilitators will face strict legal action, including confiscation of property, dismissal from government service, and denial of all state financial and welfare benefits.

Officials said the process was halted on Thursday when a powerful explosion ripped through a crowded taxi stand near makeshift shops in the border town, killing six people.
At the time of the blast, large numbers of Afghan families had gathered at the Pak-Afghan border to return home. Authorities immediately suspended repatriation and evacuated families from the area for their safety.
The movement was allowed to resume on Friday after security forces cleared the site. Officials said the entire area was swept before Afghan refugees were permitted to approach the crossing point again.
 
 

On Thursday evening, the blast claimed four lives on the spot, while two of the injured later succumbed to their wounds.
Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch confirmed the explosion took place near makeshift shops at the taxi stand.
Eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn that the powerful explosion left bodies mangled and body parts scattered.
Police said initial investigations indicated that explosives had been planted outside the shops.
The Balochistan Home Department confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident, urging citizens to cooperate with investigators. It vowed that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.
Pakistan launched a drive last year to repatriate undocumented Afghan nationals, citing security concerns and the need for strict border management.
 
 

According to government figures, more than one million Afghans without legal documents are living in Pakistan. Tens of thousands have already been repatriated through the Chaman and Torkham border crossings since the policy was enforced.
Officials say the campaign is aimed at ensuring that only those with valid visas and refugee cards remain in Pakistan.
Human rights groups, however, have criticised the policy as abrupt and harsh, warning that many returnees face uncertain futures in Afghanistan amid economic hardship and limited access to basic services.

Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the appeal before the Supreme Court pleaded for the Sept 16 restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The two-judge IHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar alongside  Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. The petition sought a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri held judicial office.
 
 

In his appeal under Article 185(3), Justice Jahangiri cited the 2010 Iftikhar Chaudhry case, in which the SC had held that the Constitution did not permit any restraint on the exercise of judicial powers by a judge or any limitation on him during proceedings envisaged by Article 209. The ruling also held that even a temporary disability placed on a judge in the discharge of constitutional and official obligations amounts to removal from office and is therefore not permissible under the Constitution.
The Sept 16 order, the appeal argued, was patently mala fide in its conception and contrary to what transpired in open court. It added that the restraining order was passed in a palpable conflict of interest, opening the door to an egregious encroachment on judicial independence, allowing a larger bench of the high court to restrain fellow judges from performing their judicial functions.
The appeal stressed that although interference in interlocutory matters is an exception to the general rule, an exception arises when an order is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to settled principles of law.
In such cases, he argued, the Supreme Court is bound to intervene to prevent miscarriage of justice. It is a settled principle that no injunction may be granted without the three prerequisites of a prima facie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience being satisfied.
However, the Sept 16 order, which the appeal described as a non-speaking order, contains no discussion of these indispensable elements, thereby lacking legal foundation. It argued that the order overturns the convention that the court is a collegiate body of judges, each exercising equal judicial power, who are required to discharge their duties in a manner that upholds comity among them.

On the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the CDA will also conduct a feasibility study of the project. The rail service will be launched from Margalla Railway Station to Saddar Rawalpindi to facilitate citizens.
Sources said utmost care is required to make this project a success, as a similar service launched in the 1990s from Margalla Station to Saddar Rawalpindi was closed within three months after being declared a failed project.
“In 1996, a train service was started from Margalla Station to Saddar (Marir), but it was closed due to a shortage of passengers, as barely two dozen passengers used to travel per trip. I still remember passengers were also provided coach and wagon services from Margalla Station, yet the desired results could not be achieved,” said an official source.
The Margalla Station is located in Sector H-9, an institutional sector.

Project aims to launch electric train with feeder bus network to improve connectivity and reduce traffic in twin cities

Meanwhile, the metro bus service is already in operation from Saddar Rawalpindi to Pak Secretariat, accommodating a large number of passengers daily.
However, officials of Railways and the CDA said that with the help of feeder bus services, the new project would be made successful. They said that instead of a traditional train, a high-speed electric train would be launched, while feeder buses would help citizens reach both stations.
Sources added that if required, Railways could extend the track from Margalla Station to 7Up Chowk, linking it with 9th Avenue, the same avenue where the metro bus service already operates. 
“This service will be a success, as a number of universities and colleges are also located in Sector H-9, so I don’t think there will be any issue of ridership,” said an official.
Though the MoU has yet to be made public, many believe the CDA will import the trains and operate the service, while Railways will provide the track and handle its maintenance.
Recently, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gave the go-ahead to Railway Minister Hanif Abbasi and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for launching the service, with the government aiming to start operations on March 23 next year.
“Draft MoU has been finalised and hopefully it will soon be signed between Railways and CDA,” said an official after a meeting held at CDA headquarters.
The meeting, chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, was also attended by officers of Railways.
“In line with the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, a meeting was held to review progress on the operation of a modern and high-speed train in Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” read a press release issued by CDA.
It said the meeting was held to finalise the draft MoU for operating a train between the twin cities.
“CDA and Pakistan Railways will soon sign the MoU regarding this project. The meeting featured a detailed discussion on the contents of the MoU,” it said.
“The meeting reviewed in detail the proposed route, layout plan, optimal business model, and eco-friendly technology for the train project.”
Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa said the completion of the train project would significantly reduce traffic flow in the twin cities. He mentioned that the train service would be integrated with feeder electric bus services to ensure easy access for citizens to key locations in Islamabad. He added that the project would provide affordable, safe and comfortable travel for citizens.
