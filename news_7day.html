SEOUL: Protesters stage a ‘die-in’ performance during a rally for Climate Justice on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of South Korea’s capital demanding the government set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, just days after President Lee Jae Myung addressed the UNGA, where US President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as ‘the greatest con job’ in the world.—AFP

ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved technical assistance to operationalise the ‘Glaciers to Farms (G2F)’ regional programme, covering Pakistan and several Central and West Asian countries, as the region faces intensified climate disaster risks.
According to an ADB report, the support will back the Climate Action Roadmap through glacier monitoring, river basin planning and regional knowledge sharing. It will also help countries establish institutional and operational mechanisms, and prepare diagnostics, studies and capacity requirements needed to implement the programme.
The early ADB support ensures that the G2F programme seamlessly transitions into the implementation phase, minimising delays, strengthening readiness of proposed projects and enhancing the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions in key sectors, including agriculture, health, social protection, and water, the report said.
Anchored by the ADB and aligned with Green Climate Fund (GCF) priorities, G2F mobilises up to $3.5 billion in public and private finance, including $325 million in GCF concessional support, to build resilience from glacier to farmland.

$3.5bn regional initiative targets glacier retreat, food security

The programme establishes a full-cycle adaptation framework by linking upstream glacier monitoring with downstream interventions in agriculture, water management and disaster risk reduction, underpinned by integrated science-policy-finance mechanisms.
The G2F feasibility assessment has confirmed that climate finance systems across Central West Asia are underdeveloped and misaligned with national priorities. Critical gaps — including the absence of green taxonomies; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards; and risk-sharing mechanisms — continue to undermine the ability of both governments and private actors to scale adaptation investments.
G2F is structured as a phased, ecosystem-based programme that leverages regional platforms such as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Programme (CAREC), while avoiding duplication and fostering country-led adaptation at scale.
It is a regionally integrated, multi-sectoral climate adaptation programme aimed at safeguarding the lives, livelihoods and ecosystems of over 370m people in Central and West Asia.
The region is experiencing rapid and severe climate impacts — glaciers are retreating at rates of up to one per cent per year, water flows are becoming increasingly erratic, and both food insecurity and climate-related health risks are intensifying. “These cascading threats are especially acute in major transboundary basins such as the Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya, where communities are heavily reliant on cryosphere-fed water systems,” the ADB report said.
Central West Asia is among the fastest-warming regions globally, with average temperatures rising by 0.2 to 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade. If these trends continue, more than 50pc of glacier volume in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges could be lost by 2100, posing an existential threat to water, food and energy security across the region.
Glacier retreat is already destabilising seasonal water availability, intensifying natural hazards — such as glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), avalanches and flash floods — and placing enormous pressure on already fragile agricultural systems. In addition to glacial retreat, snowpack is melting earlier in the year due to rising temperatures, shifting peak water availability to months when agricultural demand is still low.
 
 

This temporal mismatch between water supply and irrigation diminishes agricultural productivity and increases reliance on groundwater and reservoir storage — resources already under strain, the report said.
Any alteration in water timing, quality or quantity disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, particularly in water-stressed and low-capacity regions. Rural households, women-headed farms, and agri-micro-small-and-medium-enterprises (MSMEs) — already facing limited access to finance, infrastructure, and support services — are often the first to feel the effects of water stress and production losses.

Nobody expects them to. India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY for short, doesn’t even think that Pakistan deserve being called rivals.
But here they are, the “non-rivals” with a chance to upset India’s pre-scripted march to glory in the Asia Cup. T20 cricket is certainly a game of skill, but it is also a game of chance. And Pakistan, the underdogs, the non-rivals, have a chance.
The first two games in this minor trilogy of contests between the ex-rivals were one-sided and ill-tempered. It isn’t partial to say that India brought the bad vibes. Haris Rauf responded with some low insults and was rightly fined — along with Mr SKY for his comments after the group game.
It’s hard to imagine a final free of needle. That’s probably a good thing for Pakistan, who were more competitive in the Super Fours game as the political row escalated.
India’s cricketing dominance is built on their formidable batting, in particular the brilliance of Abhishek Sharma, the world’s top rated T20 batsman.
 
 

Sharma is a purist’s delight as he hits cleanly through the ball, whether playing under his eyes or away from his body. He has taken a liking to Pakistan’s opening bowlers and gave India an unstoppable momentum in the other two games.
Yet the biggest positive for Pakistan over the tournament is the re-emergence of its strike bowlers as a force to be reckoned with. Shaheen Shah Afridi, in particular, has started to remind us of the bowler that he was. Shaheen has a poor record against India, but his confidence should be high, and dismissing Sharma early can change the mental dynamic between the players.
This is added pressure for Shaheen, but it should be welcome for a player who wants to reclaim his status as one of the world’s premier fast bowlers.
There is a lot about Shaheen’s game that is encouraging. He is back to batting with aggression, a style reminiscent of the great all-rounder Wasim Akram.
More importantly, Pakistan need Shaheen to get closer to Wasim’s level as a strike bowler.
Inept top order
The second key area for Pakistan in this final will be the performance of the top order. Other than Sahibzada Farhan, Pakistan’s main hitters have been inconsistent and below par.
The top order lacks quality and is overreliant on the form of its middle and late order. It’s good that Pakistan’s all-rounders have some collective batting form, and that’s enough against lesser teams, but without something major from the top order Pakistan will find it hard to win.
All-round depth is something that Pakistan coach, Mike Hesson, seems to like. It certainly works when Saim Ayub chips in with vital wickets or Mohammad Nawaz scores late runs.
But you can’t build a consistently successful team around the quality of Pakistan’s selected all-rounders.
Pakistan might have lost to India only in this Asia Cup, but they are ranked above the other teams in this tournament. They should be winning those games.
When the World Cup comes around, five more teams ranked higher than Pakistan will also be there. None of those teams will be worried about the quality of Pakistan’s batting.
So, whatever happens today there is some serious work to be done if Pakistan are to be competitive in the T20 World Cup in February.
The extent of our T20 batting failure is confirmed by international rankings where there is no Pakistani player in the top 20. Where might Pakistan get that quality from? The obvious people to reconsider are Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan. The next place to look is among the next crop of young batsmen, and it’s a shame that the management didn’t stick with Hasan Nawaz.
Bowling shaping up well
Pakistan’s bowling is developing to be more competitive. There are four wicket takers in Shaheen, Haris, and Abrar Ahmed. Sufiyan Muqeem can’t get a game. Question marks hang over what to do with Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz, and Saim Ayub.
Of these, Saim offers the most promise. His wickets are proving vital. A move down the order might work for him in the way that it has done for Mohammad Haris. The other two might make or break their futures today.
The other big question for Pakistan is around the selection of Salman Ali Agha. We don’t even need to get into his captaincy because he does not look like a T20 cricketer at international level.
Agha is a tremendous asset for Pakistan in Test cricket and 50-over cricket, but his T20 journey should end here.
A win in the Asia cup will be a tremendous boost, especially against the odds, but whatever happens today the underlying problems in Pakistan’s T20 formula must not be ignored.
Pakistan’s coach has a record of success with New Zealand and some franchise cricket, but he is still getting to grips with the bamboozling world of Pakistan’s international cricket.
He has a big job to do because the selection is wrong and the batting performances are dismal.
First things first, though, and Pakistan must show Mr Blue SKY and his Indian team what a “non-rivalry” really looks like. Salman’s team have a point to prove — and some pride to restore.
Published in Dawn, September 28th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-28 02:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28073711cceb95c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945124/indian-agent-promised-plane-load-of-weapons-to-hired-hitman' target='_blank'><strong>Indian agent promised ‘plane-load of weapons’ to hired hitman</strong></a><br><p>NEW YORK: An Indian intelligence agent not only allegedly hired an Indian citizen to carry out murders in Pakistan, Nepal, and the United States but also promised to provide him with a plane-load of weapons to execute the assassinations, documents filed in US federal court show.
Documents filed in a US federal court reveal new charges against the alleged assassin, Nikhil Gupta, incl­uding money laund­ering, credit card fraud, drug and arms trafficking, and atte­mpted murder of a person in Nepal or Pakistan.
According to fresh court documents, US gover­nment lawyers claim that the alleged murder-for-hire plot was not limited to New York but also included plans to kill another person in Nepal or Pakistan.
US prosecutors allege that former Indian RAW officer Vikash Yadav promised to supply firearms and even arrange clearance for an aircraft to transport weapons from India. This was allegedly intended so that Gupta could sell the weapons to a man he believed was a trafficker, who would, in turn, help him hire a hitman to target a Sikh separatist in the United States.
In WhatsApp messages dated June 22, 2023, Yadav allegedly promised to provide “assault rifles and pistols” and to “arrange for the clearance of an airplane to transport the weapons from India.”
On June 26, Gupta reportedly followed up, asking Yadav to check on the “toys,” a coded reference to firearms. Prosecutors say Yadav res­p­o­nded that he could obtain the weapons once the killing was complete.
US prosecutors argue that these exchanges show Yadav’s alleged support was conditional on Pannun’s assassination, linking the arms offer directly to the murder-for-hire plot.
Beginning in May 2023, when Yadav instructed Gupta to “save my name as Aman,” he told Gupta over WhatsApp that there were multiple targets, including one in New York (the primary victim) and another in California, and, by reference to addresses, at least one target in Nepal or Pakistan, according to a prosecutor’s letter to the judge.
Regarding the Nepal discussions, the government stated that Yadav provided Gupta with the target’s location to pass on to hitmen, whom Gupta described as “soldiers.” On May 8, Gupta wrote to Yadav that the men had “already arrived [in Nepal] and were looking for” the target. Yadav pressed Gupta to increase their payment and stressed that the task was “urgent.” In one message, Yadav instructed: “If they have really captured the target, they should kill him. Otherwise, we won’t get another chance.”
Prosecutors argued that communications between Yadav and Gupta about the Nepal task were substantially similar to their communications regarding the New York target and described the Nepal plot as “strikingly similar” to the Pannun plan.
Nikhil Gupta’s extradition, arrest
Gupta, also known as Nick, 53, was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30, 2023, and extradited to the United States under the bilateral treaty between the US and Czech Republic. He arrived in the US on June 14 and was presented on murder-for-hire charges.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the extradition “makes clear that the Justice Dep­artment will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens.” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco described the plot as “a brazen attempt to silence a political activist for exercising a quintessential American right: his freedom of speech.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasised that the bureau “will not tolerate attempts by foreign nationals, or anyone else, to repress constitutionally-protected freedoms in the United States.”
DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said the extradition was “the result of the hard work and commitment of the DEA New York Division’s Drug Enforcement Task Force” and praised international law enforcement cooperation, inc­luding the Czech Republic’s Nat­ional Drug Headquarters.
Assassination plot
According to court documents, Gupta conspired with an Indian government employee, identified as CC-1, to target a US-based Sikh separatist leader who advocates for Khalistan, a sovereign Sikh state. CC-1, a former RAW officer with training in battlecraft and weapons, allegedly directed the plot from India.
Gupta, a resident of India with prior involvement in narcotics and arms trafficking, attempted to contract a hitman to kill the US citizen. The supposed hitman was, in fact, a DEA undercover officer. CC-1 allegedly agreed to pay $100,000 for the murder, and an initial payment of $15,000 was delivered in Manhattan in June 2023.
The plot included surveillance of the target, with Gupta sending photos and updates to CC-1. Gupta instructed the undercover operative to avoid carrying out the assassination during upcoming US-India diplomatic engagements.
Nijjar’s murder link
On June 18, 2023, masked gunmen murdered Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was associated with the target and also led the Sikh separatist movement, outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada. Gupta informed the undercover operative that Nijjar “was also the target” and emphasised multiple potential targets. CC-1 later instructed Gupta to prioritize the main target.
Gupta faces charges of murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The case is being prosecuted by the southern district of New York, with the FBI and DEA actively investigating.
The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs coordinated with Czech authorities to secure Gupta’s arrest and extradition. Trial attorneys from the National Security Division and the US Attorney’s Office are handling the case.

• Maryam says Punjab is working while other provinces are busy criticising it
• 2,200 survey teams with 10,000 personnel from army, other depts deployed in the province
• Azma Bokhari threatens to sue Nadeem Afzal Chan over loan claim
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: As the Punjab government on Saturday launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about channelling the aid through the BISP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan, Senator Palwasha Khan and the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leader Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha criticised the Punjab government, saying that the BISP already had the required data and was the most effective mechanism to assist flood-hit families.
Humayun Khan said the people were enduring severe hardships due to the floods, recalling that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had visited flood-affected areas in Punjab, and reiterated the demand for immediate relief through the BISP.
Palwasha Khan expressed regret over what she termed “unfortunate remarks” from some PML-N ministers against the PPP despite being coalition partners. “It is regrettable that the Punjab government has used such language for its coalition partner. The Punjab government says it will not bow down to anyone. Then why go to the IMF? The impression is being created that Punjab belongs to one party. Punjab is not the domain of any one party; similarly, no province is the exclusive domain of any party. All provinces of Pakistan belong to all Pakistanis,” she said.
She proposed that the electricity bills of flood-affected families be waived until they fully recover. She said the scale of the damage caused by the floods was immense and could not yet be fully estimated.
She recalled that BISP funds had previously been disbursed during the holy month of Ramazan and asked: “Why does the name of BISP cause so much pain?”
Without elaborating, she said that when the Punjab chief minister faced challenges, “the most vocal voices of support came from Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the PPP”.
 
 

Ali Shah Bacha criticised not only the PML-N but also the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for what he called its failure to help flood victims despite being in power in the province for the past 12 years. He said the floods in KP were different in nature from those in Punjab and Sindh, as they were caused by cloudbursts that wiped out entire villages and caused hundreds of deaths.
“The prime minister and the chief minister came for just one day, distributed cheques and left,” Mr Bacha said, terming the role of both the federal and provincial governments in rescue and relief efforts “disappointing”.
“The Punjab chief minister says they do not need the PPP’s advice. But when the PML-N government is in trouble, it remembers the PPP and its leadership. When the PML-N wants votes on a bill, it turns to Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari,” he added.
“If Maryam Nawaz is the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, then don’t forget that Bilawal Bhutto is the son of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and the grandson of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” he remarked.
Flood losses survey
The Punjab government launched a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods, but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
“Some 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture and livestock departments and district administration will carry out the survey. Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a completely destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said at the launch of the Punjab Flood Survey Campaign.
“We will make sure that every single flood victim is compensated and resettled. These survey teams are my eyes, ears and hands,” she said, administering an oath to the survey teams, whom she described as the “sons and daughters of Punjab”.
Indirectly responding to criticism from the PTI and PPP over what they termed her ‘flood photo/video shoot,’ the chief minister said: “If someone is working, the camera should show it because the public deserves to know what its CM is doing. We don’t seek the camera as the real work is happening, it speaks for itself.”
She said Punjab was working while other provinces were busy criticising it. The chief minister said she was often asked how she coped with criticism. “I say Punjab is progressing and that is why criticism exists. We close our ears to negativity and keep our eyes fixed on the goal,” she remarked, adding that people from other provinces wished to live in Punjab.
She thanked Pir Pagara for appreciating Punjab’s flood management.
The CM criticised the PPP for suggesting the use of the BISP database to help flood-affected people. “Distributing Rs10,000 to each flood-affected person through BISP data will do no good,” she said.
The PPP leadership, including MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, had urged the Punjab government to use BISP data instead of undertaking a lengthy survey to provide immediate relief to flood victims.
Tensions over loan remarks
As the dispute between the two coalition partners over the BISP issue continued, senior PPP leader Nadeem Afzal Chan said on X: “Punjab has emerged as the biggest borrower among all provinces, securing a staggering Rs405 billion loan from the State Bank in just the first 38 days (July 1 to August 8, 2025) of the current fiscal year (2025-26).”
Responding to the claim, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari threatened to sue Mr Chan under defamation laws and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
“Chan Sahib, you were a decent man, but for the past few days it seems you are either under mental stress or deliberately running fake propaganda against Punjab,” she said, emphasising that the facts about the loan issue had already been shared with the media on Aug 26. “Now repeating this false narrative falls under Peca.” Ms Bokhari added that under the Punjab Defamation Bill, Mr Chan would have to prove the “fabricated news” in court.

Chief Minister MK Stalin said eight children and 16 women were among the 36 who died in the district of Karur in Tamil Nadu during a political rally by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, Vijay’s party. Earlier, state lawmaker Senthil Balaji told reporters that 58 people were hospitalised.
Vijay has drawn massive crowds
Vijay, one of Tamil cinema’s most bankable actors for three decades, has drawn massive crowds to his public meetings since launching his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, in 2024, which has targeted both the state ruling party DMK and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.
He is campaigning ahead of state elections that are to be held in early 2026.
Videos from local media show thousands of people surrounding a large campaign vehicle on top of which Vijay is seen standing and speaking.
During the rally, visuals showed Vijay throwing water bottles from the top of the vehicle to fainting supporters and calling for police help when the crowd became uncontrollable.
“The unfortunate incident during a political rally in Karur, Tamil Nadu, is deeply saddening,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X.
At least 44 doctors from the nearby districts of Tiruchirappalli and Salem were sent to Karur, media reports said.
 






This is not the first time Vijay’s rallies have faced safety concerns. At least six deaths were reported by the media following the first meeting of his political party when it was launched in October last year.
Despite police-imposed restrictions, including limits on convoy size and venue changes, the sheer scale of public turnout has repeatedly overwhelmed local infrastructure.
Earlier this year, at least six people were crushed to death at a popular Hindu temple in northern India’s Uttarakhand state, officials said, after a massive crowd surge.
The stampede occurred on the stairway leading to the Mansa Devi temple in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges River, and left many injured.
“Six dead and more than 10 injured are admitted to the hospital,” senior city police official Parmendra Dobhal told AFP.</p><small>2025-09-27 19:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/272009577f8c50d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945000/kp-govt-does-not-support-operations-gandapur-tells-centre-at-pti-rally-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt does not support ‘operations’, Gandapur tells Centre at PTI rally in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who is a senior PTI leader, asserted on Saturday that his provincial government did not support any operation — a reference to military action in various parts of the province against militants.
Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.”
Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country.
 






“We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added.
Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter.
In July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action.
More recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it.
Gandapur calls for justice
At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said.
The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ would continue until it achieved success.
Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces.
Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally.
 






“In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said.
Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering.
 






Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May.
“This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan sahib being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.”
Gohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”.
“Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan sahib — 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.”
Quoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy.
“It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.”
He closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts.
“Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally. This is a rally for a man who has been stripped of his rights and locked in prison for standing for the right thing and sacrificing for future generations,” Akram said, addressing the crowd.
“He endures every problem, mistreatment and 22-hour isolation, but remains standing in the face of it all.”
The party spokesperson said that if there were true freedom, PTI figures including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Ahmed Bachar, Aliya Hamza, Ayesha Bhutta, Khadija Shah, Zartaj Gul, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed would not have been “jailed for 10 years”.
“Why did this happen? Because there is no true freedom. This is a government of slaves, thieves and mandate stealers,” Akram declared. “If there were true freedom, what happened to the flood victims at the hands of this shameless government would not have happened.
“Look at what the KP government — Imran Khan’s government — has done: we disbursed billions to flood victims and rehabilitation has started. In Punjab, [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz has not even completed the initial survey. She is a liar, chasing photo-ops.”
Akram impressed on the crowd that “these people are not your leaders”.
“They are thieves and killers; they murdered your vote. Will you endorse these murderers? Will you condemn them?”
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja took to the stage, emphasising that his party will not end its struggle until the “system of oppression” is brought down.
“I was sitting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. I asked him what message he has for you all. He said: ‘Tell my nation that I will never bend before hardship. I am in jail because I value every drop of blood my nation sheds’,” Raja said.
“Today, KP is drenched in blood: ours, the innocents and that of our martyrs. Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are all drenched in blood. Oppression is everywhere.”
Raja paid tribute to martyrs, stating that “their mothers’ tears are our tears”.
“The martyrs of Tirah ask when this system of oppression will end,” he declared, referring to those affected by a recent airstrike in KP’s Tirah area. “I bring a message from Imran Khan: our struggle, our movement, will only end when the oppression does.”
Raja then demanded the release of the PTI founder, as well as other party leaders and activists, who he said were “imprisoned without rights” and given “false punishments by military tribunals”.
 






PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that the people of KP demand only one thing and that is peace.
“We will not allow military operations in our province under any circumstances,” he emphasised. “We are tired of wars; we will not be a part of one.”
Qaiser also demanded that the federal government settle matters with Afghanistan through diplomatic channels and jirgas.
“We in KP and Afghanistan share deep relations, so we want trade and relations so that there is peace and jobs in our province,” he stated. “I am hopeful that Ali Amin Gandapur will convince this ‘Form 47’ federal government to do so.”
The PTI leader and ex-national assembly speaker noted that there needs to be peace in this region.
“We appreciate the Saudi pact, but if this country is going to progress, then it needs to establish trade relations with regional nations.”
 






Rally arrangements
According to information shared by the PTI on social media, party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally.
While television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online.
Earlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally.
The statement read that 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue.
Meanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said.
Several PTI leaders visited the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar.
Ahead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.

England have won four titles and New Zealand one, while Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka will be bidding for their maiden crown.
Australia have a shot at cricket history when the Women’s World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, begins on September 30.
 






The tournament presents the defending champion Australians, who won three consecutive titles from 1978-1988, with the chance to become the first team in 36 years to win back-to-back women’s one-day World Cups.
They have racked up 26 wins in 30 completed matches since their 2022 World Cup triumph, but captain Alyssa Healy said there would be no complacency.
“I think there’s genuinely seven other teams that have a really red-hot opportunity of winning this World Cup,” Healy said at the Captains’ Day event in Bengaluru on Friday.
“I’m not going to single anybody out. It’s quite literally who can handle the pressure for the longest that’s going to get the job done.” Australia have won 13 ICC trophies — the most in women’s cricket.
“I don’t think it’s quite in the Australian culture to get too complacent about things at any point in time,” Healy said.
Pakistan skipper Fatima aims to take advantage of familiarity
Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said they would aim to take advantage of the familiarity of the conditions in Colombo.
“We have a significant advantage playing here [in Colombo] and executing our skills because we know we will be playing all our matches at the same venue and under the same conditions, the Pakistani skipper said at the Captains’ Day event in the Sri Lankan capital.
She added that familiarity would work in favour of the Women in Green.

“Yes, definitely, our main goal is to finish in the top four. I believe the conditions in Sri Lanka are similar to those in Pakistan, so we are familiar with the exact conditions,” she continued.
Pakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.
The Green Shirts had qualified for the World Cup on the back of an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers held in Lahore in April of this year.
India seek maiden title
India, co-hosting their first World Cup in 12 years, carry the hopes of a cricket-mad nation as Harmanpreet Kaur prepares for her fifth World Cup and first as captain.
The twice runners-up (2005 and 2017) have a habit of stumbling at crucial moments, but Harmanpreet is determined to change the script.
“Leading my country in the ODI World Cup is very special, it’s happening after 12 years (at home). It’s all about enjoying this moment,” Harmanpreet said.
 
 

Sophie Devine aims to close out her career with New Zealand’s second World Cup win, banking on her team’s combination of “young and vintage” players.
“Suzie (Bates) and I have got a long history together, having played nearly 20 years in international cricket… ,” Devine said.
“I don’t think either of us will be around much longer, so certainly we’ve come into this World Cup knowing that it’s probably going to be our last one, so we just want to enjoy it.” England will be led by Nat Sciver-Brunt, who took over as captain from Heather Knight in April.
The month-long tournament starts with India facing co-hosts Sri Lanka in Guwahati.</p><small>2025-09-27 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27193013f6806b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944988/pakistan-skipper-salman-calls-for-aggression-ahead-of-clash-with-india-in-asia-cup-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan skipper Salman calls for aggression ahead of clash with India in Asia Cup final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan men’s captain Salman Ali Agha said on Saturday that he welcomed his players being aggressive on the field ahead of the first-ever final of an Asia Cup between Pakistan and India.
Under fire after two comprehensive losses at the hands of India in the ongoing Asia Cup, the Green Shirts proved they were good enough to make it to the tournament’s final when they edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in their last Super Four outing on Thursday and all that matters now for the side are the title honours.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Salman said: “Every individual has their own way. If a player wants to be aggressive, then why not? If you take aggression away from a fast bowler, then there’s nothing left.”
 
 

He was responding to an Indian journalist’s question about his responsibility as captain to keep his players’ actions in check.
“Every player knows how to deal with their emotions. I give the players a free hand unless they are disrespecting someone or causing disrespect to our country,” the Pakistani skipper added.
Speaking on the refusal of customary post-match handshakes by the Indian men’s team, Salman said: “I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve never seen teams not shake hands … I don’t think there has been an instance of players not shaking hands.”
He added that on previous occasions, even under worse circumstances between the two countries, handshakes still took place.
The Pakistan captain added that he hoped that his team had “saved their best for the final”.
Asked about media reports from across the border that the Indian captain had refused to attend the captains’ photoshoot ahead of the final, Salman said: “That’s their choice, we have our own protocols to follow.
“If he (Yadav) wants to attend, he can attend — but if he doesn’t want to, then that’s up to him.”
On Friday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military conflict between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported.
“It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
“The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added.
Pakistan’s pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four stage match against India, ESPNCricinfo added.
According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson“.
Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-27 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27205557a8289c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945003/four-teenagers-killed-by-explosive-device-in-kps-bajaur-police' target='_blank'><strong>Four teenagers killed by explosive device in KP’s Bajaur: police</strong></a><br><p>At least four teenagers were killed and two other people were injured when a mortar shell exploded in a field in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur area on Saturday, according to police officials.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Bajaur District Headquarters Hospital.
“Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.
Meanwhile, Nisar Baaz Khan, a member of the provincial assembly (MPA) from Bajaur, condemned the incident in a statement on social media and claimed that according to local residents, a quadcopter hit the village and killed innocent civilians.
“What crime had these innocent flower-like children committed? What purpose is being served by staining the earth with their innocent blood?” he was quoted as asking.
“The state institutions and provincial government have repeatedly claimed that various areas of Mamond (tehsil) have been cleared. If that is true, then on what grounds are drone strikes being conducted in these villages and settlements?”
The MPA questioned why operations are being carried out in the area when the authorities claim there are no terrorists there.
“Are the lives of our children so cheap that they can be taken so easily?”
He continued: “For decades, our people have been killed in the name of counter terrorism; their homes were destroyed and now innocent lives are being targeted once again.”
Last week, security forces carried out an airstrike in KP’s Tirah area, which resulted in four homes being destroyed and killed civilians, including children.
A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat said CM Ali Amin Gandapur met a delegation from the district following the incident with PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi, the KP chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), Peshawar commissioner and other officials also present in the meeting that reviewed the law and order situation in the “context of the unfortunate incident” that occurred in Tirah.
“Martyrdom of civilians in the incident is regrettable and condemnable. Martyrdom of civilians as a result of operations against terrorists is unacceptable,” the statement quoted CM Gandapur as saying.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in Tirah, and demanded a probe into the matter.
It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”.</p><small>2025-09-27 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27084413ab3699f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944951/khawaja-asif-says-taken-aback-after-fo-distances-itself-from-shama-junejos-presence-in-pakistans-un-delegation' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif says ‘taken aback’ after FO distances itself from Shama Junejo’s presence in Pakistan’s UN delegation</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Saturday he was “taken aback” after the Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement distancing itself from the controversy surrounding the supposed inclusion of columnist Shama Junejo in Pakistan’s delegation for a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting.
On September 25, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had addressed a UNSC session on artificial intelligence. However, photos from his speech had spread like wildfire on social media platform X as users had pointed to Junejo sitting in the background and shared several screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel.
Following social media furore, Asif said on X that Junejo’s presence at the session was at the FO’s discretion. For its part, the FO clarified that she was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session.
The matter came up during Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ today, where Asif was asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement.
“I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later,” Asif replied.
He further clarified people getting photographed with him abroad was not unusual and while Junejo, too, had a photograph with him a hotel lobby, he did not know her.
The defence minister reiterated that he was “taken aback” after he saw Junejo with the delegation but he did not ask anyone about her presence.
When asked whether she was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s speech writer and had written the prime minister’s speech at the UNGA, Asif replied in the negative. He clarified that according to the information he had, Junejo did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
Asif’s and FO’s clarifications on X
Earlier, Asif had clarified on X that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements; the premier has been attending the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said.
The defence minister said that for the past 60 years, he had an emotional attachment and personal commitment to the Palestine cause. He added that he had Palestinian friends and colleagues while working in Abu Dhabi and was still in contact with them.
 






“My views on Gaza are clear and I express them openly,” he said, expressing his hatred for Israel and Zionism.
“Who is this woman, why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf,” Asif said.
He said that his account on X was a testament to the fact that his relationship with Palestine was part of his faith.
Subsequently, in a post on X late on Friday night, the FO said that it had noted the queries regarding “the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC”. The FO did not explicitly name Junejo.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” it said.
“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/foreign minister,” it added.
 






Meanwhile, Junejo also took to X and posted screenshots of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
 






“Youthias are calling me a Zionist when for the past two years I have tweeted about Gaza almost daily, calling [Israeli PM] Netanyahu a war criminal and showing Israeli atrocities,” she said.
The term “youthia” is a derogatory term commonly used as a slur for PTI supporters.
“Once again, this entire campaign has been launched against me because they only fear me,” she said.
Uproar
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari had stated that one could not sit behind a minister in the UNSC or the United Nations General Assembly unless they were identified as an official representative of the government.
“So who allowed this to happen and why? Is there a covert policy agenda at work viz rogue entity Israel, Bagram base, Abraham Accords? GoP needs to come clean — who is responsible?” she asked.
 






Mehlaqa Samdani, the director of the Community Alliance For Peace and Justice, said: “To include Shama Junejo, who champions a pro-Israel and pro-normalisation agenda, in Pakistan’s #UNGA delegation is not a good look for Pakistan.”
 






Meanwhile, journalist Ahmad Noorani said that questioning Junejo’s patriotism or “branding her ‘pro-Israel’ over her views on diplomacy is disgraceful”.
“This vile smear campaign is being pushed by dirty-minded trolls,” he said.

Attacks on cargo ships and fuel tankers began in November 2023, when Houthi hijacked the Galaxy Leader cargo vessel as it was passing through the southern Red Sea. They redirected it toward Hodeidah port in Yemen and seized the crew. Since then, at least 43 more ships have been attacked in the area, with four seafarers killed and two vessels sunk.
The Houthi attacks have disrupted international commerce, forcing international shipping to take the long route around South Africa to avoid being struck. Around 12 per cent of shipping passes through the Red Sea and the increase in delivery costs is stoking fears it could trigger a fresh bout of global inflation.
 
 

Recent developments between Tel Aviv and Sanaa include the killing of the Houthi government’s prime minister and several other ministers in an Israeli strike on the Yemeni capital, while the Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel, targeting Tel Aviv and other cities like Eilat, where a Houthi drone wounded 22 people earlier this week.
The Houthis have also hit American vessels during this almost two-year-long period, prompting the United States to launch a series of strikes, the most recent ones being in March.
Who are the Houthis?
In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in Yemen’s far north set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, which had once ruled the country but whose northern heartland had become impoverished and marginalised. As friction with the government grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Saudi Arabia.
A civil war broke out in late 2014, when Sanaa was seized by the Houthis. Worried by the growing influence of Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia intervened at the head of a Western-backed coalition in March 2015 in support of the Saudi-backed government.
The Houthis established control over much of the north and other big population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in Aden.
Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a UN-led peace push, but the Houthi attacks on Israel have increased the risks of conflict in the country.
Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping
The Houthis say their attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea are a show of solidarity for the Palestinians and Hamas amid the latter’s fighting with Israel.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks on ships off Yemen’s coast, causing traffic passing through the Suez Canal to fall by 75pc in 2024 and increasing transit times by an average of seven to 14 days, according to US-based supply chain management technology company project44.
While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the US and Britain, shipping industry sources have said all ships were at risk.

A period of relative calm started in January this year alongside the Gaza ceasefire, but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval strikes if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza. They then announced a resumption of attacks with immediate effect on March 12.
The Israeli response
Since November 2023, Israel has intercepted multiple drones and missiles launched from Yemen and also struck Houthi facilities in response.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu detailed Tel Aviv’s military activity over the past year, stating, “We’ve hammered the Houthis.
“So here’s where things stand today: half the Houthi leadership in Yemen [is] gone,“ he said.
Over the past six months alone, Israel has launched devastating strikes on Yemen, targeting Sanaa, Houthi leadership, Houthi-controlled areas, ports and energy facilities. The port of Hodeida — a key entry point for Yemeni aid — has been struck several times over the past year, in April, May, June and July.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed earlier this month to inflict the biblical 10 plagues of Egypt on the Houthis after they stepped up missile attacks against Israel.
The Houthis are firing missiles at Israel again. A plague of darkness, a plague of the firstborn — we will complete all 10 plagues,” Katz posted on X. He was referring to the 10 disasters that the Book of Exodus says were inflicted on Egypt by the Hebrew God to convince the pharaoh to free the enslaved Israelites.
What happens now?
Based on this pattern of tit-for-tat strikes, it is likely that these attacks and interceptions will continue until Israel ceases military operations in Gaza — that have only intensified.
Today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that a liquefied petroleum gas tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month.
Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire.
“The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.</p><small>2025-09-27 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271654283ae7f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944979/security-forces-kill-17-india-sponsored-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 17 ‘India-sponsored’ terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 17 “India-sponsored” terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the IBO on the night between Friday and Saturday, on the “reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the operation, “own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and resultantly, seventeen Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR statement said.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [in the] killing of innocent civilians”.
The statement said a sanitisation operation was being conducted to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khwarji found in the area”.
 






The ISPR also reaffirmed the security forces’ determination to wipe out the menace of “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari has congratulated the security forces on their successful operation in Lakki Marwat, according to a statement issued by his secretariat.
He paid tribute to the courage and sacrifices of the forces, saying “their efforts reflect the nation’s firm resolve to eradicate Indian proxy terrorism from Pakistan”.
“The complete elimination of Fitna al Khwarij and its networks is vital for lasting peace and stability in the country,” he added
President Zardari reaffirmed that the entire nation stands united with its valiant armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
In August, terrorists in Lakki Marwat had carried out a series of militant attacks, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.

The Indian juggernaut has crushed every opposition on their path before swaggering into the final of the eight-team tournament looking every inch the reigning 20-over world champions.
Pakistan were beaten comprehensively twice, first in the group stage and then in Super Fours, by an India team containing the world’s top-ranked batter and bowler in the T20 format in opener Abhishek Sharma and spinner Varun Chakravarthy.
 
 

Six-hitting machine Abhishek is also the tournament’s leading scorer with 309 runs from six innings, often setting the tone of India’s batting in the first six powerplay overs.
In a low-scoring tournament where only Pathum Nissanka of Sri Lanka managed a century, Abhishek’s red-hot form at the top meant skipper Suryakumar Yadav’s struggle with the bat has not really been felt.
Wily seamer Jasprit Bumrah has helped India control the powerplay overs with the ball but left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav has been their wrecker-in-chief leading the bowlers’ chart with 13 wickets.
 


Fellow spinners Axar Patel and Chakravarthy have also kept it tight in the middle overs and the slew of all-rounders at his disposal has left Suryakumar practically spoilt for bowling choices.
Sparks flew and tempers frayed both times India and Pakistan met in what is their first tournament since a military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
India survived a scare in Friday’s dead rubber when they edged out Sri Lanka via Super Over after Sri Lanka managed to tie the match after getting 202 at Dubai. That should shake off any complacency that might have crept into their campaign.
“(I got) what I wanted from the boys — just to try and execute their plans, be clear and not to fear,” Suryakumar said of their flawless campaign heading into the final.
“That was really important, and I am sure everyone got what they wanted. Happy to be in the final.”
Pakistan will naturally be motivated to avoid a third defeat to the arch-rivals in a single tournament and will take heart from their thrilling victory in Thursday’s virtual semi-final against Bangladesh.
 
 

“Very excited,” Pakistan captain Salman Agha said of the final against India.
“We know what we need to do, and we are a good enough team to beat anyone, and we will come on Sunday and try to beat them.”
Ahead of the high-profile clash, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Asian Cricket Council chairman Mohsin Naqvi has stirred up a stirred up a hornet’s nest with an ambiguous post on X about a “balancing act”.
 






“How much time do you need to explain the reasons behind the balancing act?,” he wrote on X, leaving fans pondering if it was intended for the Indian team given its timing.</p><small>2025-09-27 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2717454227c4b28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944978/lpg-tanker-with-24-pakistanis-aboard-attacked-by-israeli-drone-at-yemen-port-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>LPG tanker with 24 Pakistanis aboard attacked by Israeli drone at Yemen port: Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month.
After the Foreign Office (FO) said earlier today that Pakistanis aboard the LPG tanker were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters, Naqvi posted on X that the vessel was attacked on September 17 while it was docked at the Ras Issa port, which was under the control of Houthi rebels.
 






Israel has launched repeated attacks on Houthi targets during the Gaza conflict, as the Iran-backed rebels fire missiles and drones at Israel and Red Sea shipping, claiming solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
According to Naqvi, apart from Pakistanis, the LPG tanker’s crew included two Sri Lankans and a Nepali. He said the vessel’s captain was also a Pakistani.
Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire.
“The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.
Naqvi said he was “profoundly grateful to Secretary Interior Khurram Agha and other MOI (Ministry of Interior) officers, Ambassador Naveed Bokhari and his team in Oman, our colleagues in Saudi Arabia, and especially the officials of our security agencies who worked day and night under extraordinary conditions to secure the safe release of our citizens when hope was fading”.
Earlier, the FO said 24 Pakistani nationals aboard the vessel were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters.
The FO also said that the tanker had caught fire off the coast of Yemen on September 17, adding that upon receiving the news about the incident, the relevant Pakistan embassies had established contacts with the authorities in Yemen to ensure the well-being of the crew.
“Efforts were made to set the tanker underway again,” it added.
The FO further stated that diplomatic missions also maintained contact with the family members of the Pakistani crew and kept them updated about the latest situation.

The federal government last month informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on September 1.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
According to notifications dated September 25, 2025 and issued by theMinistry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) — copies of which are available with Dawn.com — denotified camps are located in Haripur, Chitral and Upper Dir in KP, Chaghai, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Pishin and Quetta in Balochistan, and Mianwali in Punjab.
When asked about the opinion on denotifying camps where thousands of refugees are staying, the Afghan Chief Commission did not respond to a request for comment.
Haji Abdul Samad, who is representative of a main camp in Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Dawn.com this week that local officials have told him to vacate the camp in accordance with the government’s policy.
He, however, said there has been no raid, arrest or pressure on refugees to leave the Panian camp, which houses about 13,000 families and over 90,000 refugees, according to Abdul Samad.
Chief Minister KP Ali Amin Khan Gandapur stated on a number of occasions that his government will not force refugees to return.
The Safron ministry notifications say all lands within the denotified areas will be handed over to the provincial governments and deputy commissioners of the concerned districts.
They also read that all non-movable assets within the notified area will also be handed over to the provinces and deputy commissioners.
Most of the camps had been set up in early 1980s when refugees started coming to Pakistan after the invasion of the erstwhile Soviet Union.
UNHCR concerned
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, has shown concern at Pakistan’s decision to denotify some of the refugee villages.
It reiterated that returns to Afghanistan should be voluntary, phased, safe and dignified.
“Many of the people affected are Afghan refugees who have lived for years in these villages and have expressed great despair about how this development is going to impact on their lives,” spokesperson for UNHCR Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, told Dawn.com on Saturday.
“In particular, UNHCR urges that people with international protection needs and those with humanitarian considerations face particular challenges and should be protected against (forced) returns,” Afridi said.
Pakistan started repatriation of Afghan refugees in 2023 over security concerns and amid tension with the Taliban government.
Pakistan also argues that war has ended in Afghanistan and refugees should go back.
However, the refugees complain about the lack of transport. They say that they face problems finding trucks for shifting their household goods.
Gada Ali Khan Zadran, a representative of the refugees at Mianwali camp, told Dawn.com that refugees are facing difficulties in finding transport to take household items to Afghanistan.
Zadran also said that the fare of transport has also been increased from Rs300,000 to 600,000.
According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-09-27 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27170736ab5e074.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944983/11-killed-in-separate-traffic-accidents-in-balochistan-officials' target='_blank'><strong>11 killed in separate traffic accidents in Balochistan: officials</strong></a><br><p>Eleven people were killed and six others injured in two separate traffic accidents in Balochistan on Saturday, local officials told Dawn.com.
The first incident, in the Panjgur district, involved a pickup truck laden with fuel and a passenger coach colliding near Panjgur Bazaar, according to Assistant Commissioner Jawad Zehri.
“The crash was so severe that both vehicles immediately erupted into flames,” Zehri said, adding that a passing motorcyclist was also caught in the fiery collision and injured.
“Eight people were burnt alive at the scene of the accident, six of whom were aboard the passenger coach,” he told Dawn.com. “The deceased have been identified; six of them are said to be from Khuzdar and the other two from Panjgur.”
AC Zehri added that the injured motorcyclist, who is in critical condition, has been referred to Karachi for treatment.
“Levies personnel have begun investigating the incident and the bodies of the deceased are being sent to their native areas,” he said.
Meanwhile, three people were killed and five others were injured when a passenger coach collided with a car and overturned in the province’s Pishin district, Karizat Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamza said.
“The coach, travelling from Quetta to Islamabad, collided with a car coming from the opposite direction and overturned,” he told Dawn.com. “Two people were killed at the scene, while six wounded were rushed to a trauma centre.”
Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran told Dawn.com: “The injured were provided immediate medical assistance; however, unfortunately, one of the injured succumbed to their injuries on the way to the hospital.
“Those injured in the accident are being provided treatment on an emergency basis. Under my supervision, the trauma centre’s entire medical team are busy saving the lives of the injured, while two of the injured are in a critical condition.”
In July this year, three people, including a woman, were killed and nine others injured in two separate road accidents in the Chaman and Mach areas of Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-27 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26180357a95a1e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944763/jamming-drone-attacks-plague-global-sumud-flotillas-final-phase-of-mission' target='_blank'><strong>Jamming, drone attacks plague Global Sumud Flotilla’s final phase of mission</strong></a><br><p>As some Western leaders recognise a Palestinian state, Israel seems to have entered panic mode. Tel Aviv has done again what it does best: attacking unarmed civilians.
Late on Tuesday night, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — was hit by Israeli drones as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza.
The aid boats are carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aim to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide, as classified by the United Nations.

According to a statement issued by the GSF, at least 14 boats were targeted with explosive and incendiary devices while in Greek waters. Emergency communication devices were also disabled and “calculated physical damage designed to render the ships unseaworthy”.
 






Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the flotilla, told Dawn.com that his vessel was safe during the attacks. Recalling that night, he said that around 15 drones carried out 12 strikes.
“They partially damaged around seven or eight of our boats,“ Khan said. “We were able to fix the damage and the boats are still seaworthy.
“They jammed our communication systems, the systems we use to reach out to the international community for help were jammed,” he said.
 
 

Khan stated that Israeli forces used sound bombs, flares and chemical agents to inflict “psychological warfare aimed at instilling fear in the participants”.
The former senator said that the convoy has left Greek waters and is still en route to Gaza, expecting to enter international waters soon. He added that the next two to three days are crucial for the mission.
“We have been travelling non-stop and will enter international waters soon. This stretch is extremely important because the moment we enter international waters, Gaza will be right in front of us.”
Khan revealed that EU states warned of an impending escalation of attacks on the convoy as it neared Gaza.
“An attack on this flotilla would be an act of terrorism,” he stressed. He reiterated that the flotilla’s mission is peaceful and its goal is to break the blockade and deliver life-saving humanitarian aid.
Two days prior to the attack, the Israeli foreign ministry’s account on X posted a lengthy statement in which it slapped the ‘Hamas’ label on the flotilla convoy and asserted that it “will not allow the breach of a ‘lawful’ naval blockade”.
Moreover, it suggested unloading the aid at Israel’s Ashkelon Marina port from where it would supposedly be delivered to the very enclave Israeli forces are starving and continuously bombing.
 






When asked about the flotilla being labelled a part of Hamas by Tel Aviv, the former senator dismissed it as propaganda.
“They have threatened us and attacked us, but people are now seeing Israel’s true face,” he replied. “Are these activists, actors and lawmakers terrorists?”
Italy, which has stated its intention to recognise a Palestinian state — on the condition that all hostages are released and that Hamas is excluded, as outlined by its Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has not only condemned the attack but has dispatched two navy ships to assist the flotilla.

Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stated last Thursday that the country had sent two of their naval vessels to assist the Italian participants on the GSF.
“It is not an act of war, it is not a provocation: it is an act of humanity, which is a duty of a state towards its citizens,” he told the upper house of parliament. Following Italy’s lead, Spain announced that it has deployed a navy warship to help the aid convoy.
However, Khan made it clear that these vessels are “not for action”, but rather for relief and rescue.
According to the GSF, “hundreds of elected representatives from across the EU” have demanded the immediate protection of the Global Sumud Flotilla. The coalition also posted the penned appeal to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on their Instagram platform.
Using Italy and Spain as an example, Khan called on the Pakistani government to take action and aid the flotilla.
“No official has reached out, nor have they raised this at international fora like the UN and the OIC,” he lamented.
“The Pakistan government should state their support for the Global Sumud Flotilla and should condemn the attack. Like Italy and Spain who have sent their navy ships, Pakistan should dispatch a mission. If they cannot send navy ships then they should send a civilian humanitarian mission, something like Rescue 1122, so it can help in rescue efforts,” he stressed.
 






During his conversation with Dawn.com, Khan noted that parliament also has a role to play in raising its voice against the attack.
“Pakistan’s parliament and parliamentarians should also play their part.”
On September 19, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) issued a statement calling attention to the GSF and highlighting Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s concerns about its safety.
The statement read that FM Dar, along with his counterparts from Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ireland, Libya, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mexico, Oman, Qatar, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain and Turkiye, expressed concerns about the security of the flotilla.
“We therefore call on everyone to refrain from any unlawful or violent act against the flotilla, to respect international law and international humanitarian law,” the FO said.
Replying to a question about nations recognising a Palestinian state, the ex-senator expressed displeasure with the fact that European nations are recognising the state according to the 1967 borders and excluding Hamas from the governance process.
 
 

“They are not recognising the state according to the 1948 borders, but those from 1967,” he explained. “In doing so, they are ignoring the government, currency and other aspects of the state from that time.
“Hamas is a governing entity which won an election. I demand that Israel grant Palestinians political independence.”
Meanwhile, the Israeli foreign ministry account on X posted another proposal, this time to unload the aid at any country outside Israel.
“If this is not about provocation and serving Hamas, you are welcome to unload any aid you might have at any port in a nearby country outside Israel,” the post read.
Resorting to threats is all Israel seems to know, as the post ends with the question of whether the GSF’s humanitarian mission is about “aid or provocation“.
According to Reuters, Italy suggested that the GSF could leave the aid at Cyprus and that it would then be handed to the Catholic Church’s Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, who would then distribute it in Gaza.
Reacting to their country’s recommendation, Italian volunteers on the GSF categorically rejected the notion of dropping aid in Cyprus.
The Italian group, in a statement, said that their mission stays “true to its original goal of breaking [Israel’s] illegal siege and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza.”
Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar accused the participants of the GSF by stating that their rejection of Italy’s compromise was supposed proof that “their real purpose is provocation and serving Hamas“.
 






Israel seems to think it owns the seas and can do what it likes without consequence, including attacking humanitarian vessels on international waters.
In the backdrop of the 80th UNGA, the apartheid state continues to bomb Gaza and extend its aggression to those trying to address the plight of its civilian population.

The latest attack on the flotilla is the third of its kind; however, this time, Israel has faced condemnation for the attack. The first two strikes, which took place on September 10 and 11 in Tunisian waters, targeted the ‘Family’ and ‘Alma’ boats.
Footage of incendiary devices striking the boats was circulated on social media with calls for an investigation. Tunisian authorities, however, denied that any foreign device had intercepted their airspace.
On Friday, Kieran Andrieu — one of the participants on the ‘Family’ boat — said in a video message that the vessel had been decommissioned due to engine failure and would not sail to Gaza.
“The good news is that there are enough spaces on all of the other boats for people to be reallocated, so we are waiting to hear about reallocation and about who’s going where,” he said.
 






Echoing the sentiments of all the participants on the flotilla, the former JI senator placed emphasis on the commitment to reach Gaza and distribute humanitarian aid.
“We will not stop, we will reach Gaza under any circumstance. We will deliver humanitarian aid, we will break the siege and we will stand against genocide. This is our commitment.”

The protest was launched in July against the government’s taxation policies and suspension of customs clearance at the port.
Trade leader Javed Hussain, who led the protest, told Dawn.com, that the announcement about traders ending the protest ending was made by the supreme council — a body that had represented the them in talks with the federal and GB government.
Following the negotiations, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari had announced on Wednesday that the government had agreed to tax exemptions on imports coming through the Sost Dry Port — provided that the goods were for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions. The total annual value of tax exemptions was capped at Rs4 billion.
However, expressing dissatisfaction over the negotiations’ results, GB traders had decided to continue to the sit-in and hold a meeting with the supreme council.
Hussain said the traders had ended their sit-in on the suggestion of the council but, at the same time, he expressed reservations on the decision.
He maintained that the decisions taken during negotiations with the government were not completely in line with their demands.
Separately, trade leader Rehan Shah shared with Dawn.com that the protesting traders had held a meeting with the supreme council last night, during which the sit-in and the agreement reached with the government were discussed.
Shah added it was decided that containers stuck at the Sost Dry Port for the past two years would be cleared in the next two days and a statutory regulatory order (SRO) would be issued within a month, which he said would be the practical implementation of the traders’ demands. He added the supreme council and traders would hold another meeting to decide the future plan of action when the SRO was issued or even if its issuance was delayed.
Earlier, a committee constituted by the GB chief minister had suggested that a special consolidated SRO should be introduced to grant tax exemption for GB.</p><small>2025-09-27 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2713442950da749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944954/pm-shehbaz-terms-meeting-with-us-president-trump-very-encouraging' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz terms meeting with US President Trump ‘very encouraging’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed his recent meeting with US President Donald Trump as “very encouraging”.
His came after the two leaders had their first formal bilateral interaction at the Oval Office in Washington on Thursday. During the meeting, they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters.
The premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
 
 

The meeting itself was closed to the press — a break from President Trump’s usual modus operandi — as he is quite fond of Oval Office photo-ops and there was no press conference either; just a statement issued from Pakistan where the US president was described as a “man of peace” and stressing the need to enhance cooperation in security and intelligence.
During an interaction with the media in New Jersey, which was aired on Geo News on Saturday morning, the premier said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. The PM added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.
“We have signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with one of their delegations,” he said, without sharing any further details.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan’s economy has “stabilised at the macro level” and also credited overseas Pakistanis for their contributions and efforts. “No amount of gratitude is enough,” he said.
The premier also hailed Field Marshal Asim Munir for leading the nation “from the front” during a four-day military encounter between Pakistan in India in May.
“He led Pakistan with courage, boldness, and intelligence,” the PM said.
Soon after the escalation, Pakistan had said it had downed six Indian jets. However, the PM said on Friday that the number of downed Indian jets was seven.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27114407ec0c030.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944953/defence-minister-skirts-nukes-question-says-defence-pact-has-formalised-relationship-between-ksa-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister skirts ‘nukes’ question, says defence pact has formalised relationship between KSA, Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that the recently signed Pak-Saudi defence pact had “formalised” a relationship between the two countries that was previously “a bit transactional” while skirting a question regarding whether or not this agreement involved nuclear weapons.
Asif made the remarks during an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan for Zeteo. The full interview is behind a paywall but the media company has shared a five-minute preview as well as clips on social media.
On September 17, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also comes just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
Previously, Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework. However, in a subsequent interview the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
In the preview posted on Zeteo’s website on Friday night, Hasan asked Asif about the defence pact.
“How much of it is a reaction to the Israeli bombing of Qatar?” he asked.
“It is not a reaction to what happened in Qatar because this was being negotiated for quite some time. So it’s not a reaction; perhaps it must have sped it up a bit but that is all. It was already in the offing,“ Asif replied.
Hasan then pointed out that Pakistan was the only nuclear power in the Muslim world, noting that Saudi Arabia had expressed interest in being the second. He also pointed out that Asif had previously stated that nuclear weapons “were not on the radar” for this pact.
“Is Saudi Arabia protected by Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella per this agreement or not?” he asked.
“We have had a very long defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, spanning five or six decades. We had a military presence over there, perhaps more than four or five thousand at the peak and we still have military presence over there. I think we have just formalised that relationship which was previously a bit transactional,” Asif responded.
“Formalised with or without the nukes?” Hasan probed.
However, the minister refrained from going into the details.
“I will refrain from going into the details but it’s a defence pact and defence pacts are normally not discussed publicly,” he said.
Hasan then pointed out that journalist Bob Woodward, in his 2024 book War, had quoted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman telling a US senator that he could “just buy” a bomb from Pakistan.
“I think that is just sensationalised […] No, I don’t believe that quote,” the minister replied.
“So you are not in the business of selling nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia?”
“No. We are very responsible people,” Asif responded.
Pak-China ties
In a separate video shared on Instagram, Hasan asked the minister whether Pakistan’s now close relationship with the United States could jeapardise its vital relationship with China.
“Obviously, America and China are at loggerheads,” he said.
“No, we are not worried about that because it’s a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s,” Asif replied.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

When probed further about Pakistan “flirting” with the US, the minister said that China was not worried in this regard.
“Is your strategic future with China or with the US? It can’t be both,” Hasan pointed out.
The minister responded by saying that China had been a “very reliable ally” for Pakistan.
“A major portion of our arms are from China. And our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before,” he said, adding that this was due to the “unreliability of other sources, like the US”.
“So are you basically saying that your strategic future is with China, not the US?” Hasan asked.
“Yeah […] they are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share geography,” the minister said.
Imran Khan’s arrest
In another clip posted on Instagram, Hasan asked about incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and asked why he had been arrested.
“That’s the problem with Pakistan: you all imprison each other every time you come into power […] If it was unjust to you, isn’t it unjust to Imran?” he asked.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The minister asserted that it was not a tit-for-tat measure.
However, Hasan then pointed out Amnesty International had released a report on Imran’s arrest while a United Nations group had said that there was no legal basis for Imran’s imprisonment and termed it arbitrary.
“Well, I think they have an opinion with which I disagree,” Asif responded.
“Their opinion is that you are breaking the law,” Hasan said.
“No, we aren’t breaking the law,” Asif asserted.
“Pakistan has a situation whereby we are trying to recover from a very, very — misrule or bad rule or whatever you can call it —  for three-and-a-half years,” the minister said.
He also further said that whole families were arrested during Imran’s tenure.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27141142a176ade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944972/new-drone-sightings-over-denmarks-biggest-military-base' target='_blank'><strong>New drone sightings over Denmark’s biggest military base</strong></a><br><p>Unidentified drones were observed during the night over Denmark’s biggest military base, police said on Saturday, the latest in a slew of sightings that Danish officials have called a “hybrid attack”.
The mystery drone observations have prompted the closure of several airports across the Scandinavian country since Monday, when the first drones appeared.
“I can confirm that we had an incident around 8:15pm (11:15pm PKT) that lasted for some hours. One to two drones were observed outside and over the airbase,” duty officer Simon Skelsjaer told AFP, referring to the Karup military base.
He said police could not comment on where the drones came from, adding: “We didn’t take them down.”
Police were cooperating with the military in their investigation, he said.
The Karup base shares its runways with the Midtjylland civilian airport, which was briefly closed though no flights were affected as no commercial flights were scheduled at that hour, Skelsjaer said.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that “over recent days, Denmark has been the victim of hybrid attacks,” referring to unconventional warfare.</p><small>2025-09-27 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/27122410ead4a20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944964/palestine-un-reforms-come-under-discussion-as-fm-dar-meets-general-assembly-president' target='_blank'><strong>Palestine, UN reforms come under discussion as FM Dar meets General Assembly president</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) President Annalena Baerbock on Saturday and discussed key regional and international issues, including Palestine and UN reforms.
The meeting occurred on the sidelines of the 80th session of the UNGA in New York. A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had addressed the session, highlighting the need for “proactive” leadership for South Asia and expressing support for Gaza.
In a statement on X, the Foreign Office said that Dar and Baerbock “exchanged views on key regional and international issues, including [the] Palestine issue and the urgent need for UN reforms, including UN Security Council reforms”.
Dar reaffirmed commitment to regional and global peace and stability and called for the just resolution of the Kashmir dispute per UNSC resolutions, it added.
 






Separately, the foreign minister held meetings with his counterparts from various countries, including Malaysia and Morocco.
Dar met Malaysian FM Dato Seri Utama Mohamad Hasan, where both leaders agreed to review the bilateral economy and global issues in Kuala Lumpur in early October.
“Pakistan and Malaysia continue to work together to advance our partnership, both bilaterally and at multilateral fora,” he said in a post on X.
“We agreed to review our mutual economic agenda and current global issues in Kuala Lumpur in early October 2025,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the FO said that Dar also met with Morocco’s Nasser Bourita, noting, “both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity, and regional peace.”
“They also reaffirmed their shared commitment to deepening Pakistan–Morocco relations and further strengthening collaboration at multilateral fora,” it wrote on X.

The fire is suspected to have started with an explosion on Friday night of the battery produced by South Korea’s LG Energy Solution during maintenance, damaging some servers and forcing the shutdown of hundreds of others, officials said.
The fire led to a “thermal runaway”, producing extreme heat in the server room at the National Information Resources Services in the city of Daejeon, preventing firefighters from taking aggressive actions to contain the blaze, fire and government officials said in press briefings.
The national data service acts as a cloud server for many government services and databases for the heavily wired Asian country. It operates data centres in other locations.
The fire, which began around 8:20pm (4:20pm PKT), was brought under control early on Saturday, but more than 600 servers remained in forced shutdown to protect data while firefighters worked to extract nearly 400 battery packs from the building as safety measures, officials said.
The cause of the initial spark was not known and was under investigation, they said.
LG Energy Solution declined to comment as the case is under investigation.
Some government ministries, the mobile identification system, the postal service, and the government legal database were among websites that remained down on Saturday after the fire in Daejeon, about 140 km (90 miles) from the capital Seoul.
Some ministries are unable to use email, according to notices to reporters.
Prime Minister Kim Min-seok apologised on Saturday for the inconvenience to the public from disrupted services and said the government would work swiftly to restore services. In the meantime, tax payment deadlines coming soon would be delayed, he said.
“There were difficulties in containing the fire because of the nature of critical government systems being concentrated at one site,” Kim told a televised emergency meeting.
The internal networks of some government agencies in Daejeon and nearby Sejong were “paralysed”, Kim said. There was no estimate for when services would restart, the head of the data centre, Lee Jae-yong, told a briefing.
One person has been treated for a minor injury, a fire official told another press briefing. There was considerable fire damage at the location of the initial blaze on the fifth floor of the building, fire official Kim Ki-seon said.</p><small>2025-09-27 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/271146074142095.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944873/quadripartite-moot-urges-kabul-to-counter-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Quadripartite moot urges Kabul to counter terrorism</strong></a><br><p>NEW YORK: The foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, in a joint statement, have urged Afghan­istan to take “effective, concrete, and verifiable actions” to dismantle terrorist groups operating from its territory.
The foreign ministers in a meeting on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session reaffirmed support for Afghanistan as an “independent, united, and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war, and narcotics”, but underlined the need to prevent terrorists from using Afghan soil.
The four Asian states have been holding quadripartite consultations on Afghanistan since 2017, aimed at promoting reg­ional stability and coordinating efforts to counter terrorism, narcotics, and extremism emanating from Afghan territory. This informal grouping, which meets at ministerial and special representative levels, also seeks to facilitate political dialogue and regional economic integration in Afghanistan.
They expressed deep concern over the presence of groups such as ISIL, Al-Qaida, Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP), the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Jaish ul-Adl, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the Majeed Brigade, and others, calling them a “serious threat to regional and global security.”
 






The joint statement emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering terrorism, radicalism, and narcotics are “common interests in the region”.
The four sides also called for adjustments to the 1988 UN sanctions regime in line with ground realities, including travel exemptions for some Taliban officials; stressed the need for continued humanitarian assistance to Afghans, urging that aid be delinked from political considerations; supported regional economic initiatives to ease Afghan­is­tan’s dire situation and integrate it into regional trade and connectivity; and appealed to the international community to intensify emergency huma­nitarian aid while reaffirming their willingness to exp­and economic cooperation with Afghanistan.
 
 

The ministers affirmed their support for diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a political settlement of the Afghan issue and backed the role of the international community, particularly the United Nat­ions.
They noted the importance of regi­o­nal mechanisms such as the Moscow For­mat, the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of Afghanistan’s Neighb­ouring Countries, and the Shanghai Co­operation Organisa­tion (SCO) in advancing a political solution.
They welcomed the joint meeting of the Special Representatives of China, Iran, Pak­is­­tan, and Russia on Afghan­istan, held on Sept 12 in Dushanbe and encouraged the con­­tinuation of these quadrilateral consultations.

• 161,000 houses, 395 health facilities damaged in Punjab, UNOCHA says
• Senate panel told deluges left 1,000 dead, millions displaced
ISLAMABAD: As millions of people have been affected and hundreds of casualties reported across the country during the recent floods and monsoon rains, the prime minister has raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives from Rs1 million to Rs2m.
More than 4.2 million people in 18 districts of Punjab have been affected by the recent floods, with Muzaffargarh alone accounting for over a quarter of the total, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) report released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Muzaffargarh, located on the bank of the Chenab River, is followed by Jhang with 646,000 affected people (15.3 per cent), Bahawalpur with 514,000 (12.2pc), Khanewal with 397,000 (9.4pc), and Multan with 347,000 (8.2pc). Other affected districts include Vehari, Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, Chiniot, Gujrat, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, Narowal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Gujranwala.
 
 

The RNA, conducted from Sept 8 to 18 in collaboration with the government, covered 1,928 mouzas in these 18 flood-hit districts.
Out of 161,000 houses assessed, about 115,700 were partially damaged and 46,000 fully or severely damaged, leaving thousands of families without adequate shelter. More than 93pc of the assessed locations reported some level of housing damage, with the highest numbers in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal and Jhang. Approximately 2.8m people have been displaced, many forced to leave flooded, damaged or destroyed homes.
According to the report, the affected population faces urgent shelter and non-food item (NFI) needs, particularly tents, tarpaulins, GI sheets, plastic sheeting and winterisation kits, including blankets, bedding, mats, shawls, mosquito nets and warm clothes.
Health facilities
A total of 742 health facilities were assessed across the 18 districts; 395 were reported damaged — 315 partially and 80 fully or severely — posing a serious threat to the continuity of healthcare services. The highest proportions of damage were observed in Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Okara.
In absolute terms, Bahawalnagar recorded the greatest impact with 64 facilities damaged, followed by Jhang (55) and Muzaffargarh (46). Other districts also reported significant damage, including Bahawalpur (35), Chiniot (39) and Khanewal (25), with several facilities fully destroyed.
By contrast, Mandi Bahauddin (8pc), Vehari (17pc) and Dera Ghazi Khan (22pc) reported relatively limited impact. The scale of damage in the hardest-hit districts underscores the urgent need to restore and reinforce health infrastructure, as disruptions could reduce access to essential care, delay outbreak response and heighten community vulnerability.
 
 

The RNA highlights a significant disease burden across 1,928 flood-affected villages. Malaria was the most reported health concern (64pc of assessed villages), followed by skin infections and diarrhoea, indicating deteriorating water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Dengue was also reported at considerable levels, adding to the challenge of vector-borne diseases.
Educational institutions
According to the School Education Department, floods damaged 667 schools across the 18 districts, of which 54pc were girls’ schools.
Moreover, 217 schools were repurposed as evacuation centres, affecting 101,263 enrolled students. Most damage was recorded in Sialkot (210 schools), followed by Jhang (110), Gujrat (83), Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu (82 each), and Rahim Yar Khan (15).
Nearly 97,000 water supply schemes were reported damaged. Over one-third of the assessed villages reported damage to these schemes. Of the 48,500 fully damaged schemes, 60pc were in Muzaffargarh, 12pc in Jhang, and 10pc in Bahawalpur.
 
 

Before the floods, communities in most districts relied heavily on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Crop farming was the primary source of income for over 85pc of communities in Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, with similarly high levels in Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Chiniot, Multan, and Narowal.
Livestock
Livestock rearing engaged more than 70pc of communities in most areas, while daily wage labour was a key income source in Bahawalnagar, Gujranwala, and Khanewal.  Floods have devastated these livelihoods by damaging crops, killing livestock, and disrupting agricultural cycles, leaving many households without produce or animals to sell. As farming activities stall, wage opportunities linked to farm work and local markets are shrinking, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into income loss and food insecurity.
Most communities reported having food stocks lasting only a week or less. Food insecurity is most critical in Multan, where 81.7pc of communities reported very limited stocks. Similarly, 76.2pc in Bahawalnagar, 74pc in Muzaffargarh, and 61.5pc in Bahawalpur said their food would run out within days.
Ex-gratia assistance
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat was informed that the premier raised the ex-gratia assistance for the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the floods from Rs1m to Rs2m. The revised compensation package will have a financial impact of about Rs2.033 billion.
The committee’s meeting, chaired by Senator Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, was briefed on the overall flood situation by a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
He reported that around 1,000 people had died in the recent floods, while about 1,000 others had sustained various injuries. He added that the numbers were expected to rise once rescue, evacuation, and relief operations were completed and floodwaters receded.
The NDMA said around three million people had been rescued or evacuated between June 26 and Sept 19. The committee was also told the floods damaged 12,559 houses and resulted in the loss of 6,509 livestock. The figures are expected to rise as assessments continued.
The meeting was attended by senators Saadia Abbasi, Ataur Rehman, Aimal Wali Khan, Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Dr Afnanullah Khan, and Shahadat Awan, along with the secretary of the Establishment Division, special secretary of the Cabinet Division, chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

The direction came after the federal government transferred Rs5 million into the account of Abdullah’s family. During the hearing, Additional Attorney General and officials of the defence ministry presented the receipt of the online transfer before the court.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, while addressing the victim’s father, remarked that the family would receive the money by tomorrow, but added that compensation could not heal the trauma caused by enforced disappearances. “This money cannot cure the family’s suffering,” the judge observed.
He further warned that the matter could lead to criminal proceedings at any stage, criticising parliament for its silence on the issue. 
“This is the work of parliament, but unfortunately they have closed their eyes,” he remarked.
Justice Kayani stressed that the court wanted only the truth about Abdullah’s fate. “We should be told whether the missing citizen is alive, dead, or in an Afghan jail. Officers should just come with the record and inform the court of the facts — we are not writing anyone’s name in the verdict,” he said.
The judge noted that intelligence officers regularly appeared before the Missing Persons Commission but expressed reluctance when summoned by courts. “I do not know why they get so angry with the court while the same officers appear before a retired judge in the commission,” he added.
He further observed that financial settlements could not resolve the longstanding issue of enforced disappearances.
“The state does not have a shortage of money, but the problem will not be solved by paying money. 
The court should be informed whether the person was killed, left the country or is hiding somewhere,” Justice Kayani remarked.
Lamenting the lack of progress over the past decade, the judge said no authority had so far provided the courts with the truth. 
“Brigadier Sahib! We cannot tear up judgments, you have to tell us where the missing person is,” he said, while reminding the defence ministry’s representative that the family was not at fault and everything should be handled in accordance with the law to maintain public trust.
The court adjourned the hearing until Oct 6, directing the ministry to inform it beforehand which officer would appear for the in-camera briefing.

For the national side’s head coach Mike Hesson, whose credentials were questioned after India outplayed them in the group-stage and Super Four clashes, Pakistan deserved to be in the final after beating all of their opponents through the course of the tournament apart from the archrivals.
 
 

And it’s India only, who’ll be in Pakistan’s way to their Asia Cup title ambition come Sunday.
“We’ve deserved this opportunity, and now it’s up to us to make the most of it,” Hesson told reporters on Thursday night. “All the games before this were about getting into a position to win the trophy.
“We know that the only match that really counts is the final, and that’s our focus, to play our best game when it matters.”
Coming into the Asia Cup after a tri-nation series victory, Pakistan somewhat comfortably beat Oman and hosts United Arab Emirates, with their seven-wicket loss against India coming in between the two fixtures.
Pakistan’s Super Four stage, meanwhile, started with a six-wicket loss against Suryakumar Yadav’s men — the national side performing slightly better with the bat this time — before they went on to edge Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
The two losses seem to have given Pakistan enough information to work with as they prepare for the final — the first time the teams from the neighbouring countries meet in the Asia Cup 41-year history.
“The way we played against India in the last match was a huge step up from the first game,” Hesson noted. “In the first one, we were a bit passive and allowed India to control the game. But in the last match, we had the game by the scruff of the neck for long periods, and it took an exceptional innings from Abhishek Sharma to take it away from us.
“Outside of that, we were pretty good. It was mainly the power play with the ball. We have to be good enough to put them under pressure for longer periods. We did it for about 10 overs with the bat and after the powerplay with the ball, but we need to sustain it longer. There’s a reason they’re rated the top side in the world. That’ll be our challenge.”
And the challenge will be huge, given how Pakistan struggled with the bat against Bangladesh. They were reeling at 46-4 at the end of the powerplay before a fightback of sorts dragged them to 135-8.
Hesson admitted Pakistan were yet to “play the perfect game”.
“Look, I think whenever you get to different phases of the tournament, your opposition often doesn’t allow you to play the perfect game, and we were far from perfect,” the coach observed. “We realized that in the first 10 overs.
“… but the fact we can win games from that position just shows the character in the group. Today, whenever we tried to play aggressively, we got out before getting used to the pitch. These are lessons, and as pitches tire, discipline becomes even more important.”
Hesson, however, was wary that the final against India will have a lot to do with the players’ mindsets.
“We’ve been talking about focusing on the present and not getting ahead of ourselves,” he said. “The boys always aimed to be in this final, and we had to play good cricket to get here.
“We’ve beaten teams we hadn’t beaten in a long time, and we won the tri-series before this. There’s confidence in the group, and wins like today — when everyone writes you off 10 overs in — only build that confidence further.”

• FBR analysis points to widespread reluctance in voluntary asset valuation
ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic U-turn, the government on Friday scrapped the asset valuation column from the tax return form for 2025 — just a day after issuing a strongly worded clarification — bowing to mounting pressure from various stakeholders.
The lightning-fast reversal, prompted by criticism from tax practitioners, lawyers and other groups, has reignited debate over policy consistency and digital reforms aimed at documenting the cash economy.
The income tax return form for 2025, released on July 7, had required taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form. Since then, taxpayers had been submitting returns with the flexibility to either declare the estimated market value of their assets or enter zero in the designated column.
This practice continued even as nearly 2.7 million taxpayers filed their returns under the same arrangement. However, internal analysis by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) revealed a widespread reluctance to voluntarily declare market values.
In response, the FBR introduced a technical adjustment to the system, eliminating the option to enter zero and effectively making it mandatory for all filers to disclose a fair estimate of their asset values. This move triggered strong resistance from multiple quarters, highlighting persistent reluctance to support the formal documentation of the country’s largely cash-driven economy.
On Thursday, the FBR issued a strongly worded clarification, urging taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets in good faith. It assured filers that such disclosures would not be used as grounds for additional taxation and that no supplementary documentation would be required for verification, nor would tax notices be issued solely on the basis of declared asset values.
Despite these assurances, the controversy persisted. In response, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-powered committee led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to examine the new column in the IRIS tax return system that required the declaration of estimated fair market value of movable and immovable assets.
 
 

The committee was tas­ked with evaluating the implications of the provision for taxpayers and recommending corrective measures to ensure clarity, fairness and administrative feasibility.
On Friday, the committee held consultations with top tax officers to assess the legal aspect of the column.
“The requirement to declare the true market value of assets is firmly embedded in the income tax law,” a senior tax official said, adding that many taxpayers were reluctant to disclose the actual value of their assets, reflecting broader resistance to financial transparency.
Following deliberations, the committee decided to remove the estimated market value column from the 2025 income tax return form on the directives of the prime minister, an FBR announcement said.
The committee included the federal minister for petroleum, the minister of state for finance, the attorney general for Pakistan, the special assistant to the prime minister on coordination, the finance secretary, the FBR chairman and its member customs.
After detailed discussions in its meeting on Friday, the committee recommended that the new column requiring taxpayers to declare estimated fair market values of their assets be withdrawn in the interest of simplifying the filing process.
The recommendation was submitted to the prime minister, who approved it.
According to the statement, in line with the premier’s directives and considering the difficulties faced by taxpayers, the “Estimated Fair Market Value” column has been removed from the income tax return form.
It clarified that the column had been introduced solely for data collection to support the Economic Survey and had no bearing on the assessment of income or tax liability.
The FBR reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating taxpayers and urged all eligible individuals to file their returns accurately and in good faith before the Sept 30, 2025, deadline.
