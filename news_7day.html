The advance places the index 0.66 per cent above its previous close of 164,626.29 points.
So far in the session, the index has touched an intraday low of 162,953.63 and a high of 165,827.14. The 2,873.51 point range reflects the elevated volatility that has persisted from earlier in the week into today’s trading.
Investor sentiment remains fragile. A similar pattern unfolded on Wednesday, when the index staged an early rebound, but ultimately closed in the red, shedding 1,632.25 points.
Among the most actively traded stocks, Unity Foods Limited led volumes, declining 9.72pc to Rs11.89 on turnover of 45,654,369 shares. It was followed by TPL Properties Limited, which fell 11.35pc to Rs7.81 on volume of 17,430,585 shares, and K-Electric Limited, down 1.56pc to Rs7.59 on 13,186,463 shares.
On the gaining side, Gulistan Spinning Mills Limited rose 16.70pc to Rs6.01, while Chenab Limited advanced 10.02pc to Rs11.53 and B.F. Modarab increased 10.01pc to Rs20.45.
Conversely, LSE Capital Limited was among the steepest decliners, falling 21.33pc to Rs0.59. TPL Properties Limited also remained under pressure, down 11.35pc to Rs7.81, while Javedan Corporation (Pref) shed 10pc to Rs86.73.
The sharp intraday swings underscore the intensity of ongoing volatility, as investors remain cautious amid prevailing market triggers.</p><small>2026-02-26 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261141391ff4bb5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975876/two-brothers-serving-in-bannu-police-abducted-from-mosque-killed-by-militants' target='_blank'><strong>Two brothers serving in Bannu police abducted from mosque, killed by militants</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: A tragic incident during Taraweeh prayers on Wednesday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district has left the area in mourning after militants raided a mosque and abducted three brothers, two of whom were police personnel.
Eyewitnesses reported that 10–12 armed men entered the mosque, held worshippers hostage, and abducted three brothers before fleeing to an unknown location.
The abducted individuals were identified as Saeed Akhtar, a clerk at the commissioner’s office, and Amjad and Hazratullah serving in the Wazir subdivision’s police force.
Police officials confirmed that the two abducted police personnel were later brutally killed and their bodies were dumped along Marwat Canal Road, while the third brother remains missing.
Local Chairman Masoom Wazir said he received information about two bodies and, upon reaching the site, found both victims covered in blood. The bodies were immediately taken to the District Headquarters Hospital.
RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan stated that the kidnappers were affiliated with a militant group and that a full-scale operation is underway against them. He vowed that the martyrs’ blood would not be in vain and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice at all costs.
He strongly condemned the terrorists for violating the sanctity of a mosque, describing it as a deeply tragic and reprehensible act.
The RPO added that terrorist elements have previously used mosques as hideouts, but police continue to carry out operations against such groups to ensure the protection of places of worship and the lives and property of citizens.
The senior police official stated that police and other security agencies are jointly conducting search operations at various locations to recover the third abducted individual. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities immediately.
Earlier on February 21, during an intelligence‑based operation in the district, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.</p><small>2026-02-26 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26103709a0860c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975874/us-presses-missile-issue-as-new-iran-talks-to-open-in-geneva' target='_blank'><strong>US presses missile issue as new Iran talks to open in Geneva</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Iran are set to hold indirect talks in Switzerland on Thursday, aiming to strike a deal to avert fresh conflict and bring an end to weeks of threats.
The new round of negotiations in Geneva comes after the US carried out a massive military build-up in the region and President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if a deal is not reached.
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”.
He also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.
The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental US.
The dispute between the countries mostly revolves around Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful.

 

However the US has also been pushing to discuss Iran’s ballistic missile programme, as well as Tehran’s support for armed groups hostile towards Israel.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem” on the eve of the talks.
He followed up by saying, “the president wants diplomatic solutions”.
Iran has taken anything beyond the nuclear issue off the negotiating table and has demanded that the US sanctions crippling its economy be part of any agreement.
‘Neither war nor peace’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday he had a “favourable outlook for the negotiations” that could finally “move beyond this ‘neither war nor peace’ situation”.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, has called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”.
In a foreign ministry statement that followed a meeting with his Oman counterpart, Araghchi said the success of the US negotiations depends “on the seriousness of the other side and its avoidance of contradictory behaviour and positions”.
The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, which is mediating the negotiations, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, fresh tensions between the US and Iran emerged after Tehran engaged in a bloody crackdown on widespread protests that had posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.
Trump has threatened several times to intervene to “help” the Iranian people.
Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that “the region seems to expect a war at this point”.
In January, there was “a big push by a number of Middle Eastern states to convince the US not to” strike Iran.
“But there’s a lot of apprehension at this point, because the expectation is that this time, a war would be bigger” than the one in June.
Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.
Homemaker Tayebeh noted that Trump had “said that war would be very bad for Iran”.
“There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” the 60-year-old said.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26104329c9fccf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975875/us-arrests-ex-air-force-pilot-for-training-chinese-military' target='_blank'><strong>US arrests ex-Air Force pilot for training Chinese military</strong></a><br><p>The US Justice Department announced the arrest on Wednesday of a former Air Force fighter pilot who allegedly trained Chinese military personnel without authorisation.
Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said.
He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.”







Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”.
He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets.
He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job.
“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.
“This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699f6e588b30c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975772/pm-meets-sindh-cm-murad-assures-all-out-help-for-uplift-projects' target='_blank'><strong>PM meets Sindh CM Murad, assures all-out help for uplift projects</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday assured full cooperation of the federal government for timely completion of infrastructure development projects in Sindh during a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.
The chief minister briefed the prime minister in detail on the progress of ongoing development initiatives in the province, a Prime Minister’s Office news release said.
The Sindh CM and several other leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have been demanding that the federal government initiate and complete mega infrastructure development projects in the province especially the much-needed Sukkar-Hyderabad Motorway (SHM), the only missing portion of motorways networks from Karachi to Peshawar and northern areas of the country.
Recently, PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi had expressed concern over what he called deteriorated condition of major roads in Sindh due to negligence of the federal government. 
He also demanded that the Centre immediately start the Sukkur-Hyderabad Moto­rway and long-delayed Jamshoro-Sehwan Indus Highway which was to be completed in 2017.
During the meeting with the Sindh CM, the prime minister said the federal government would extend all possible support to ensure early completion of projects in Sindh. 
He directed the relevant ministries to maintain close coordination with the provincial government to accelerate public welfare initiatives.
The PM said that the PPP was an important ally of the federal government and emphasised that national development could be further accelerated through cooperation among coalition partners.
He noted that harmony and consultation among allied parties were essential for national stability and continuity of policies.
Appreciating Sindh’s leadership as a key partner in the coalition government, the prime minister said strong coordination between the federation and provinces would strengthen the democratic system and help address public issues effectively.
Matters relating to Sindh’s political situation and other issues of mutual interest also came under discussion.
Members of the federal cabinet Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Ahsan Iqbal and Rana Sanaullah were also present.

The move aims to ensure public safety, maintain law and order, and facilitate the uninterrupted operational movement of security personnel.
South Waziristan Upper Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir confirmed that Section 144 has been enforced in the tehsils of Sarvekai and Sararogha from 6am to 6pm. During this period, all movement will be strictly prohibited, and all markets and commercial centres will remain closed.
The affected routes include Makin, Sararogha, Kot Kai and Spinkai Raghzai up to Nazar Khel. Additionally, the route from Dargai Bridge through Madi Jan, Sheen Warsak and Moley Khan Sarai to Chagmalai will also remain closed.
Officials said in the statement that residents have been instructed to stop their vehicles at least 50 metres before approaching security forces and to ensure that all passengers exit the vehicle if required. The deputy commissioner emphasised that violators will be held personally accountable and that strict compliance with security directives is mandatory.
Meanwhile, South Waziristan Lower Deputy Commissioner Musarat Zaman announced that Section 144 has also been enforced in various parts of Wana. The curfew, effective from 6am to 6pm, prohibits all non-essential movement. The measure comes in response to security threats and the movement of security forces.
Officials said that restricted routes include Wana, Taiarza Gate, Karb Kot, Tanai, and Azizabad Chowk up to Dargai Bridge. Movement is only allowed for emergency purposes with prior permission from police or security forces and submission of valid identification and travel documents.
The deputy commissioner urged citizens to strictly adhere to security instructions and avoid non-essential travel. Any violation will be the sole responsibility of the individual concerned.
During Section 144 enforcement in both districts, only approved emergency movement will be permitted. Citizens are advised to cooperate fully with security forces, remain patient, and avoid any activities that may compromise public safety. Markets, shops, and commercial centres will remain closed to maintain law and order.
Officials stressed that these measures are essential to maintain sustainable peace, support security operations, and ensure the safety of residents.</p><small>2026-02-26 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2609474047a4848.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975728/treasury-takes-flak-for-luxury-jet-purchase' target='_blank'><strong>Treasury takes flak for luxury jet purchase</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A stormy sitting of the Punjab Assembly saw exchange of heated arguments over the Punjab government’s purchase of a new “luxury” aircraft, arrests of opposition lawmakers and a flurry of legislative reforms tabled in the House.
The controversy over the provincial government’s newly acquired aircraft took centre stage as Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) MPA Shazia Abid questioned whether the Rs11 billion plane would be available for official visits to south Punjab.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Zahid Bukhari defended the purchase, stating that if PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari could use the Sindh government’s aircraft, the Punjab government was equally entitled to use its own plane as it deemed appropriate.
Opposition Leader Moin Riaz Qureshi demanded clarity that which budgetary head funded the aircraft purchase and whether it was bought for “Air Punjab” or exclusively for the chief minister. He termed the acquisition of a “luxury” jet unnecessary amid the economic challenges being faced by the country, triggering desk-thumping and sloganeering by other opposition members.
Government Chief Whip Rana Arshad hit back, asking why the opposition was objecting to the plane when chief ministers of other provinces also use official aircraft.
The House also witnessed sharp protests over the alleged arrest of nine opposition MPAs without the speaker’s permission. Opposition members claimed this violated parliamentary norms.
MPA Sardar Sarfraz Dogar alleged he was unlawfully detained for three days and later booked in a “false FIR,” calling it contempt of the assembly. He insisted that members could not be arrested without the speaker’s approval.
Treasury members responded by accusing the opposition of having double standards, referencing past arrests of political figures, including Maryam Nawaz and her father.
Earlier, responding to questions about the Information and Public Relations Department, Minister Azma Bukhari announced plans to purchase a new building,equipped with modern facilities, to consolidate all departmental offices under one roof.
She also addressed concerns over the Punjab Journalists Housing Foundation (PJHF), confirming that its office would soon be shifted from a rented building to a commercial space in “Press Club Society.”
On staffing reforms, the minister admitted that past recruitment in her department had been made without merit and announced the launch of a “restructuring drive” this year. “Only necessary positions will be retained; redundant seats will be abolished,” she said, adding that performance reviews would be conducted.
LAW AND ORDER: A general debate on law and order was initiated by Parliamentary Secretary Khalid Mahmood Ranjha, who claimed crime rate had declined across Punjab.
He highlighted a significant reduction in rape cases, recovery of illegal weapons and operations against the gangs in Katcha areas.
Opposition members disputed the government’s claims, alleging political victimisation and suppression.
Several legislative measures were also introduced in the House and all referred to relevant committees for two months. These included the Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; Punjab Land Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Public Utilities Infrastructure Protection Ordinance 2026; the Punjab Waqf, Trust and Cooperative Societies (Monitoring) Bill 2026; The Punjab Sales Tax on Services (Amendment) Bill 2026; and The Punjab Infrastructure Development Cess (Amendment) Bill 2026.
The government also tabled amendments to the Punjab Employees Social Security Ordinance 1965 to align it with the revised minimum wage of Rs40,000. The draft noted that while the minimum wage had been raised, the outdated salary cap of Rs22,000 remained in the law, causing legal and administrative complications.
According to the bill’s text, the proposed amendments would validate social security contributions paid since July 2022 and prevent an estimated Rs24 billion loss to the provincial exchequer. The legislation will be enacted as the Punjab Provincial Employees Social Security (Amendment) Act 2026 after committee review and final approval by the governor.

The Sindh government along with the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), finalised the estimate of losses incurred by the shopkeepers of Gul Plaza in their trading goods, with the assistance of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), which put the total sum at Rs7 billion.
The officials involved in the process said that the KCCI, right after the government’s nod for compensation, initiated the process and invited claims from traders regarding their losses. The process, they said, was carried out on a fast track basis and in less than three weeks all the claims were verified and the estimates were finalised.
“The government didn’t interfere and made the traders’ body, the KCCI in charge of verifying all the claims and preparing the final estimates,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn. “The registration of traders was done in collaboration with the KCCI to ensure transparency and fairness. The KCCI has done its job.
It verified all claims and cross-checked all the figures. All available documents, bank account details and tax returns were examined and the amount of seven billion rupees was finalised as compensation. The cabinet has approved the amount and we will start paying compensation to the affected traders in the next few days.”

KCCI has estimated compensation amount after cross-checking documents, bank accounts, and tax returns of fire-hit shopkeepers

Zubair Motiwala, prominent industrialist and renowned business leader, who oversaw the process on behalf of the KCCI, lauded the government’s efforts and said the compensation process was completed in record time “with 100 per cent satisfaction of all affected traders”.
“There are more than 900 affected traders with around 1,200 shops,” he said. “Many had more than one shop in Gul Plaza. We set up special counters at the chamber’s building, where we received claims from traders and verified them according to set standards.
The compensation ranged from a few hundred thousand rupees to more than Rs10 million for each trader, depending on their losses. This compensation covers the trading goods that the traders lost in the fire.”
Alternative locations
Regarding an alternative location for the shops, Mr Motiwala said the government had already identified a few locations — including Parking Plaza, New Jamia Market and Royal Market where it plans to build business facilities for the traders so they can restart their businesses.
Apart from the compensation for trading goods, the government had already paid Rs500,000 each to 1,153 affected traders as an initial amount to help bridge the gap during the process, he added.
“Along with this immediate relief, the Sindh government has also offered that if any shopkeeper wishes to take a loan, the government will provide up to Rs10 million as an interest-free loan on easy instalments,” said Mr Motiwala.
Mayor Wahab vowed that apart from compensation, the government had also taken emergency steps to provide immediate relief to the affected shopkeepers and has offered free alternative spaces at different locations across the city to enable them to resume business.
“Around 350 affected shopkeepers of Gul Plaza have been provided temporary stalls at the site of Baradari, Bagh-i-Jinnah (former Polo Ground), in the first phase so that they can resume commercial activities,” he said.
He said parking, basement facilities, security arrangements and deployment of police and wardens had been finalised. He added that the government would stand by the affected traders until complete restoration of their businesses.

KARACHI: A man working as a fireman in a private firm narrated his heroic efforts before the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission on Wednesday, which led to the rescue of 11 persons from the burning building on the night of Jan 17.
The man, Danish Ali, maintained that he had voluntarily participated in the rescue operation as the windows of the ill-fated building were either blocked with inventory or completely sealed, while the gates were largely locked.
The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court also recorded the statement of one of the six persons, who had managed to escape from the deadly blaze, as the remaining survivors did not turn up.
Mr Ali deposed that he had been working as a fireman for the last 11 years and was currently employed at an industrial unit. “After completing my duty, I was passing near the Gul Plaza on the night of Jan 17 and noticed thick clouds of smoke emanating from the building, which was later identified as a fire,” he said.

 

He also submitted that the fire was spreading rapidly, and a few individuals on the third floor were screaming for help, and he sought the assistance of the fire crew to provide him with ladders to rescue them.
The witness further testified that he, along with a volunteer of the Edhi Foundation and a labourer, started rescuing people with the help of ladders and managed to rescue 11 persons, including seven from the third floor and four from the rooftop by climbing up through the adjacent Rimpa Plaza.
He maintained that firefighting personnel were not actively working and most of them were not professionally trained. As per fire protocols, the first vehicle reaching the fire site must be loaded with proper equipment, including gas masks and breathing apparatus, but nothing was available, he added.
The witness also asserted that the windows of the building were either blocked with the inventory or completely locked, and the gates were also mainly closed, while there was also no need to completely shut the electricity.
“I further state that in normal circumstances, fire does not spread so rapidly, and the fire department is also responsible for not rescuing the people within the response time due to lack of professional staff and in the absence of necessary equipment”, he alleged.
Thereafter, the commission invited the municipal commissioner, chief fire officer and director general of Rescue 1122 to cross-examine the witness as he had levelled serious accusations of misconduct.
The commission also recorded the statement of Syed Abdullah, who testified that he was busy in shopping on the mezzanine floor of Gul Plaza when the electricity supply switched off and people began shouting that a fire had erupted in the building, while smoke was also rapidly spreading inside the building.
He also stated that he, along with some shopkeepers, attempted to escape by partially removing an iron grill gate as the same was locked.
He, along with some shopkeepers, was brought down with the help of a decorating truck; in the meantime, he fell unconscious.

 

Responding to a question of the commission about the role of building management or rescue services in saving people, he said that they came out of the building at their own and he did not notice their participation in the rescue operation.
The commission had also summoned five other survivors, but they did not turn up.
Meanwhile, the commission also issued notice to Additional Controller Civil Defence Fatima Memon after outgoing director Abdul Hameed informed it that he could not reply to the questionnaires as he was no longer holding the charge.

CT came mainly under the centre; success depended on governance quality, LEAs’ adaptability, cooperation and federating units’ political ownership. Debate on kinetic options’ effectiveness and cost shifted attention from CT to preventing and countering violent extremism (PVE/CVE). Kinetic options could kill terrorists and dismantle their networks, but defeating ideology needed a different, long-term approach.
Uncertainty initially prevailed over the war on terror’s duration and global impact. Few states drafted policies to adequately meet the challenge; 25 years on, the focus is on persisting implementation gaps. Policies are usually drafted away from conflict zones by those who may lack knowledge of geography and sociopolitical dynamics.
Over-optimism in policy formation leads to weak implementation. Poor planner-implementer coordination weakens chances of success. Policies are hastily drafted after major events without clear timelines or resources. Implementation needs civil society support, but NGOs are often viewed with suspicion.
CT and CVE/PVE have concurrent jurisdiction. Internal security policies, ministries and agencies are federal. Implementation is largely provincial. Weak political ownership hinders institutional effectiveness. Federating units are limited by geographic boundaries, but terrorists are not. Federating units should view CT and PVE holistically, beyond geographical limits.
A limited reading of the 18th Amendment hinders provincial implementation of federal policies. The centre formulated NAP, NISP I and II and NSP — all post-18th Amendment. However, the provincial role in areas like curricula, madressah and police reforms, that need centre-province collaboration, remained weak.

Policy must be converted into practice.

Political instability and different governments (federal and provincial) impact CT and PVE efforts. Policies chiefly remain reactive, such as drafting NAP in response to the APS tragedy. Lack of parliamentary input gives room to bureaucratic sway. Time and quality of debate for such issues in parliament don’t keep pace with reality; provincial assemblies usually focus on policy’s political aspects.

 

Article 140A explains LGs’ creation. However, in practice, policy implementation is a matter between the centre and provinces; it leaves out LGs, which must be included. There’s also a structural gap in CVE policy implementation due to a security architecture designed for countering the war on terror, not peacebuilding. Policy must be converted into practice to move from fighting terrorism to preventing extremism.
A statistical approach isn’t enough; communities may prefer short-term needs to long-term interventions, such as extending taxes to Malakand and GB. Improved outreach and incentives are needed. Implementing departments may lack authority to adjust activities, budgets and timelines.
Coordination mechanisms often lack enforcement powers, leading to duplication, gaps or contradictory action. Weak inter-agency communication delays information flow and decision-making. Policies can appear as stagnant documents. Without real-time feedback, issues are identified only after the damage. Insecurity and unstable access increase operational constraints. Social fragmentation may obstruct implementation.

 

Low institutional trust also reduces im­­plementation space. Limited availability of reliable data leads to planning blind spots. Transparency and free information flow can improve implementation. Some oppose new policies as they thr­­eaten existing pow­er structures. For exa­mple, former Fata’s ma­­liks and Baloch­ist­an’s sardars respectively opposed Fata’s merger and B areas’ conversion into A areas. The reversal of A areas into B in 2008 weakened the rule of law in Balochistan; however, the state’s commitment vis-à-vis Fata’s merger into KP showed firmness.
Empowering and giving Nacta a provincial presence may help in implementing the National Counter Extremism Policy Guidelines and NAP. District peace committees are needed for local peacebuilding. Gaps can be addressed by promoting peace education, removing hate material and instilling peace skills. A National CVE Index can standardise indicators.
The planning ministry recently launched the Peace and Development Unit to ensure that development projects strengthen social cohesion, reduce inequalities, provide real-time conflict situation analysis, identify conflict drivers, spoilers and enablers early, and promote joint planning and shared monitoring systems.

The latest in the parade of grim numbers is a revelation by the Planning Commission that the number of people living below the poverty line has surged since 2018.
Since 2001, these numbers had been declining, sometimes slowly, other times rapidly. But for the first time in nearly a quarter century, we have seen them rise, from 21.9 per cent of the population living below the poverty to 28.8pc today.
A few months ago, another revelation came from the World Bank that Pakistan’s economy was no longer lifting people out of poverty, even when it grew. Successive growth spurts generated fewer jobs, lifted fewer people out of poverty and on the whole promoted greater inequality rather than sharing the fruits of growth more equitably.
Corporate profitability spiked rapidly during this period, although much of that was also just inflation-driven, meaning inflation was being priced into corporate cash flows. But one thing that did not adjust to inflation was wages and incomes, which declined or remained flat (at best) in real terms during this period.
The economy has been sinking into this quagmire for many years now and this parade of dismal data that has been coming out for months is only telling us that the industrial structure we now have is no longer capable of carrying the country into the future. It is not competitive on the global market and cannot fetch exports in the volumes required to meet its own import requirements.
This is one important reason why the country’s foreign exchange reserves deplete every time its economy grows. The same system cannot generate incomes in quantities sufficient to produce a market for its own goods, which is one of the top reasons why its investments cluster around those sectors where large state-sponsored rents are to be had.
It cannot produce jobs in quantities sufficient to lower the unemployment rate in any meaningful sense, which is one reason why wages and incomes remain subdued even as corporate cash flows recover following bouts of severe inflation, and why the informal sector is the large job-creating engine in the country.
If Pakistan’s industrial system cannot lift wages and incomes, does not lift people out of poverty even when it is growing, cannot create jobs or export proceeds, then what use is it? There is only one reason why we continue carrying this dismal situation along with us without any attempts at change: it is working for those whom it is supposed to serve, not the rest of us.

We pay for their failures, and they give themselves pay raises instead. In truth, the system is working just fine.

The rest of us are being crushed under the weight of these dysfunctions, because it is us who have to ultimately pay the bills. First the bills come in the form of an inflation tax. Your real household income has most likely declined in the past decade, and if it hasn’t, then te salute. On top of that, your tax burden has increased massively, your utility bills have more than doubled (mine have tripled since 2015), while your food and fuel expenditures have also doubled or tripled. If you’re feeling beleaguered under the weight of growing expenses, take heart. You’re not alone. With rare exceptions, everyone in the country is going through this as we count up all that has survived in the wake of the most ferocious inflationary fire our country has ever seen. The degradation in living standards is near ubiquitous.
I say ‘near ubiquitous’ because there are the lucky few who have compensated themselves. In the same period as the rest of the country was sinking below the poverty line, our civil servants gave themselves enough pay raises in various forms to keep their own heads above water. There were ad hoc relief allowances in the budgets of FY24 and FY25 of 30pc and 20pc respectively, coupled with a transport monetisation increase of 20-25pc for senior officers to compensate for the fuel price hike.

 

In November 2024, our judges of the Supreme Court received a 171pc increase in salary and a 400pc increase in their house rent allowance, while high court judges received a 218pc increase in salary and the same increase in their house rent allowance. Examples of the ways in which servants of the state and servants of the people compensated themselves generously for the loss of income caused by the inflationary fire of 2022 and 2023 are endless.
Now comes news that the chief minister of Punjab has decided to purchase for herself a luxury private jet. And other senior civil servants in her province received entitlements for super luxury vehicles, along with 800 litres of fuel allowance. All this while the state is struggling to meet its external debt obligations, and lecturing those who invested in solar net metering that they are ‘elites’ with no thought for the poor.

 

This is where we stand today: a country bankrupted, a people impoverished, a middle class consuming its savings to survive, and a state elite oblivious to the burden they place on the people they pretend to rule. This never ends. People need to know this. It will never end because so long as they can keep offloading the costs of their failures onto us — the common citizenry — they will do so, and they will have no reason to change.
We pay for their failures, and they give themselves pay raises instead. In truth, the system is working just fine. It’s supposed to deliver outsize profits to the billionaires and an outsize living to the servants of the state. Confucius once said, ‘If you pay peanuts, monkeys will work for you’, but in Pakistan, it is us who work for the peanuts while the monkeys feast at the table. Welcome to the future. It’s yours and mine alone, dear reader, to rue and endure together.

No country has yet completely secured the legal rights necessary for women’s full economic participation.
On average, economies score 67 out of 100 for gender-equal laws on the books. Yet that figure drops to 53 when enforcement is measured, and to just 47 when the adequacy of supportive systems such as access to justice and childcare services is assessed. Clearly, while there has been progress in legislation, there has been little political will and administrative capacity to make those laws meaningful.

 

The gap between promise and practice is widest where women’s economic participation is most urgently needed. South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa, home to rapidly growing youth populations, continue to maintain some of the most restrictive legal barriers. At a time of sluggish global growth and demographic strain, excluding half the population from full economic opportunity is not merely unjust, it is economically self-defeating.
Within this global picture, Pakistan’s performance is deeply concerning. The report assigns Pakistan a legal frameworks score of 46.68, far below the global average of 67. Its supportive frameworks score stands at 50.68, only marginally above the global average of 47, suggesting that while some policies or institutional arrangements exist, they are limited.
However, the most troubling figure is its enforcement perceptions score — 27.35, barely half the global average of 53. In brief, even where rights exist on paper, experts perceive them to be weakly or inconsistently enforced. Pakistan’s position reflects the broader South Asian dilemma.
The country faces a youth bulge and chronic economic fragility, yet underutilises women’s labour and entrepreneurial potential. Legal barriers affecting workplace equality, inheritance, mobility, access to credit and childcare continue to shape women’s life chances. Even where statutory protections are present, such as provisions against workplace harassment or formal guarantees of certain rights, poor implementation weakens their impact. Laws without enforcement risk becoming symbolic gestures rather than instruments of change.

 

Notably, Pakistan is absent from the list of economies that enacted significant reforms between 2023 and 2025. At a time when other states are expanding parental leave, mandating equal remuneration and dismantling job restrictions, stagnation has its own cost.
For Pakistan, the path forward is not limited to new legislation. It requires strengthening courts, regulatory bodies and complaint mechanisms; investing in affordable childcare; ensuring equal access to finance; and collecting reliable data broken down separately for men and women. Above all, it requires political resolve to embed women’s participation at the heart of economic reform. Inaction is tantamount to surrendering growth.

Videos verified by this news agency showed a masked group of men, who residents said were Israeli settlers, approaching the village near the city of Hebron, and later burning vehicles and Palestinian property.
“They attack us almost every day, repeatedly, because we live near the main road…Last night they burned everywhere,” Halima Abu Eid, a Susiya resident said on Wednesday.
The Israeli military said they had dispatched soldiers to deal with rep­orts of “deliberate burnings of Pa­l­­e­s­t­inian property” and had ope­n­ed an investigation into the incident.

UN has documented 86 instances of violence from Feb 3 to 16, leading to displacement of 146 Palestinians

Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza in October 2023, with over 800 Palestinians displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to United Nations data.
Attacks where masked settlers arrive at night to destroy Palestinian property or attack residents have become common, as Israeli settlers seek to control large swathes of land in the West Bank.
An Israeli official previously blamed settler violence on a “fringe minority”, although reporting has shown well-organised plans to take Palestinian land in public settler social media channels.
The United Nations has documented at least 86 instances of settler violence from February 3 to 16, leading to the displacement of 146 Palestinians and the injury of 64.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2pc resulted in indictments.
Israel’s far-right governing coalition has enabled the rapid spread of settlements, with some ministers openly stating they want to “bury” a Palestinian state. Most world powers deem Israel’s settlements, on land it captured in a 1967 war, illegal, and numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity.
Israel disputes the view that its settlements are unlawful and it cites biblical and historical ties to the land.

The Microsoft co-founder is among the prominent names appearing in documents released by the US Justice Department that revealed close friendships, illicit financial dealings and private photos with convicted sex offender Epstein.
In a town hall on Tuesday with staff at the Gates Foundation, a recording of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Gates expressed regret that his relationship with Epstein had affected the work of his philanthropic organisation.
“It was a huge mistake to spend time with Epstein” and to also bring Gates Foundation executives into meetings with Epstein, he said. “I apologise to other people who are drawn into this because of the mistake that I made.”
In a draft email among the documents released by the Justice Department, Epstein alleged Gates engaged in extramarital affairs, writing that his relationship with Gates ranged from “helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls, to facilitating his illicit trysts, with married women.”
“I did have affairs, one with a Russian bridge player who met me at bridge events, and one with a Russian nuclear physicist who I met through business activities,” he said.
But he denied any involvement with victims of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls. “I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit,” Gates told the town hall.
The tech titan said his relationship with Epstein began in 2011, three years after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Gates said he knew of an “18-month thing” restricting Epstein’s travel but didn’t check his background.
He said his then-wife Melinda expressed concerns about Epstein in 2013, but that he continued the relationship for at least another year.
“Knowing what I know now makes it, you know, a hundred times worse in terms of not only his crimes in the past, but now it’s clear there was ongoing bad behavior,” Gates told staff.
The Gates Foundation said Gates addressed the Epstein case and other issues at its scheduled twice-yearly town hall event. “Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions,” it said in a statement.

On his first visit to China as Chancellor, Merz, who was accompanied by a large business delegation, told President Xi Jinping that he wanted to deepen economic ties with China, Germ­any’s largest trading partner last year.
“There are challenges, which we should talk about today, but the framework in which we operate is exceptionally good and we have worked together very well over the past decades,” he said.



Xi welcomed the comments from Merz, who faces a tough balancing act of redefining an economic relationship that is increasingly unfavourable to German interests . “The more turbulent and intertwined the world becomes, the more China and Germany need to strengthen strategic communication and enhance strategic mutual trust,” he said.
China’s trade surplus
Merz’s visit follows his warning this month that the postwar international order underwritten by the US alliance with Europe was no more and that Europe must stand on its own in a world of great power rivalry.
In an earlier meeting with Premier Li Qiang, Merz said there were “very specific concerns regarding our cooperation, which we want to improve and make fair.” Merz’s comments reflect longstanding German concerns about what Berlin sees as an undervalued yuan, market-distorting subsidies and overcapacity among Chinese exporters that have built massive trade surpluses with Europe’s largest economy, amounting to 90 billion euros ($106 billion) last year.
He noted that the deficit had increased fourfold since 2020, and said this was largely due to overcapacity. “This dynamic is not healthy,” he told reporters after the meetings. German business has been deeply concerned by its dependence on strategic commodities from China including rare earths and basic chips after Beijing tightened export controls last year, sending shockwaves through Western manufacturers.
At the same time, Merz’s visit underlined the vital importance of China’s huge consumer market and the technical sophistication of its all-conquering manufacturers.
“We want Chinese investment in Germany,” Merz said at a business event attended by senior German and Chinese business leaders from the tech and auto sectors.
Li told Merz that China wished to cooperate in areas like automobiles and chemicals as well as emerging fields including artificial intelligence and biomedicine.
He also said China was willing to import more high-quality products from Germany and encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Germany, according to a readout from the meeting released by Xinhua news agency.
“China will unswervingly expand high-level opening-up and actively address the reasonable demands of foreign-invested enterprises from Germany and other countries,” he said.
Fair global governance
Merz is accompanied by top executives from 30 German firms including top carmakers such as Volkswagen and BMW which are acutely feeling the strain of Chinese competition — contributing to the growing trade imbalance.
China has been seeking to present itself as a reliable economic partner, as Europe struggles with a new, less certain relationship with Washington and vulnerabilities in its supply chains exposed during a bout of trade turbulence last year.
China’s market, once coveted by foreign businesses for its wide consumer base and rising spending power, has changed in recent years with a slowing economy capping consumer demand and manufacturing overcapacity increasingly pushing domestic firms to look for opportunities abroad.

Police said retired Major General Suresh Sallay was taken into custody at dawn in a suburb of the capital, Colombo.
“He was arrested for conspiracy and aiding and abetting the Easter Sunday attacks,” an investigating officer told AFP. “He has been in touch with people involved in the attacks, even recently.”
The coordinated bombings targeted three upmarket hotels in the capital, two Roman Catholic churches and an evangelical Protestant church outside Colombo.
The attacks killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners, and were blamed on a homegrown jihadist group.
Police, in a statement, said that Sallay was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and would be detained for at least three days for questioning.
His arrest was welcomed by the Catholic church, and criticised by his still powerful supporters.
“What we need is the truth behind the Easter attacks,” church spokesman Father Cyril Gamini Fernando told AFP.
‘We want to see justice for all the victims.”
The church has accused successive governments of failing to identify the masterminds.
The April 21, 2019 attacks were the worst to target civilians in the country, where at least 100,000 people were killed in nearly four decades of civil war.
Sallay, who was promoted to State Intelligence Service (SIS) chief in 2019 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president, is accused of involvement in organising the suicide bombings, a charge he denies.
His long-expected arrest came ahead of the seventh anniversary of the bombings.
British broadcaster Channel 4 reported in 2023 that Sallay was linked to the bombers and had met them prior to the attack. A whistleblower told the network that Sallay had permitted the attack to proceed with the intention of influencing that year’s presidential election in favour of Rajapaksa.
Two days after the bombings, Rajapaksa declared his candidacy and went on to win the November vote in a landslide after promising to stamp out extremism.

• NPR report says key records were catalogued but never released; include over 50 pages of FBI interviews with a female victim• Democrat calls withholding of files ‘illegal’; launches probe against Justice Department• Dept says unreleased materials are privileged or part of ongoing investigation
THE US Department of Jus­tice has withheld Epstein files containing allegations that US President Donald Trump sexually abused a minor and also removed other related docume­nts from a public database, according to a report by the US National Public Radio (NPR).
According to the report, dozens of pages catalogued by the DOJ, including what appear to be over 50 pages of FBI interviews and notes with a woman who accused Trump of sexually abusing her as a minor decades ago, have not been made public as mandated by law.
The DOJ declined to answer NPR’s specific questions on the record but said that any unpublished documents are privileged, are duplicates or pertain to an ongoing federal investigation.
Following the report, the top Democrat on the House Over­sight Committee said his staff had confirmed the discrepancy.

 

“Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,” Rep. Rob­ert Garcia said in a statement. Garcia announced a parallel investigation into the DOJ’s handling of the documents.
When asked for comment, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump has been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him” by releasing documents and cooperating with Congress.
One allegation detailed in internal FBI documents involves a woman who claimed that when she was about 13, around 1983, Epstein introduced her to Trump. She alleged that Trump assaulted her, and when she resisted, he struck her and threw her out, according to the report.
While this specific claim appears in an internal FBI list and a slideshow, NPR found that associated FBI interviews with the accuser appear to be missing from the public files. A review of case logs from the criminal trial of Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, indicates the FBI interviewed this woman four times.
However, only the first interview, which does not name Trump, is in the public database. In that interview, the woman’s attorney said a photo of Epstein she provided was cropped because she feared “implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.” FBI agents noted the picture was a “widely distributed photograph” of Epstein with Trump.
Other missing files relate to a key witness in the trial that led to Maxwell’s 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. That woman told the FBI she met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club as a minor while being abused by Epstein. She recounted Epstein telling Tru­mp, “This is a good one, huh,” to which both men chuckled.
NPR reported that the FBI in­­terview detailing this acco­unt was temporarily removed from the public database before being restored, while an interview with the woman’s mother that also mentions Trump remains offline.
Robert Glassman, an attorney for the witness who testified against Maxwell, criticised the department’s handling of the document release.
“The DOJ was ordered to release information to the public to be transparent about Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal enterprise network. Instead, they relea­sed the names of courageous victims who have fought hard for decades to remain anonymous and out of the limelight.”
A DOJ spokesperson told NPR the department is working to ad­­dress redaction concerns from victims, noting that due to the large volume of information, sensitive or personally identifiable information may have been inadvertently included.

“It was a race against time. Sifting through technical data, establishing coordinates and isolating the target,” a senior security official said. “It didn’t take long before we knew the location.”
By late evening, they had already laid siege to the residence, taken up position and called out those inside to come out, hands raised, and surrender.
For a moment, there was no movement. But then, someone showed a raised hand from behind the door, indicating their willingness to surrender. Except that he didn’t.
Aiming a 9mm gun straight at the security cordon, the lone gunman fired straight shots, hitting an assistant sub inspector of the police right in the chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring two intelligence officers.
The exchange of fire didn’t last long, though.
Within minutes, the gunman, said to be in his mid-thirties, was shot and killed. But the brief distraction offered by the gun battle gave those inside the house sufficient time to destroy cellphones and any other evidence of communication that could possibly betray them.
The gunman turned out to be a high-value target — identified as Yousaf alias Qasim aka Idrees — the leader of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group in the Bajaur region, and the main handler of the Imambargah suicide bomber, carrying a reward of Rs12 million.
What followed was more startling, as the counter-terrorism department dug further into this cell’s activities. The gang, it turned out, had been involved in a series of assassinations and suicide bombings before stepping out of the tribal district to relocate to Gujranwala, Lahore and finally to Nowshera’s Hakimabad.
Investigators now have enough evidence to link them to the targeted assassination of all 20 men involved in the lynching to death of an IS-K operative, out to kill a local JUI-F leader for issuing a scathing attack against it.
They were also linked to the assassination of senior JUI-F figure Mufti Sultan Mahmood in Bajaur in October 2019, a suicide bombing at the party’s convention on July 30, 2021 that left more than 54 dead and over a hundred wounded, and the bombing and assassination of ANP leader Maulana Khanzeb on July 10, 2025.
Additionally, investigators say, the group was involved in the killings of at least 15 policemen, as well as the murder of the Nawagai assistant commissioner in a bombing on July 2, 2025.
Investigators say that Idrees — a tailor by profession — had been on their radar for some time, but had managed to evade capture by changing locations, moving with women and children, and avoiding staying at one location for longer periods.
“Pretty much living like nomads, leaving whatever little they had behind before moving onto the next location without notifying the landlord,” was how one official described his movements.
What surprised investigators the most was the role of the women in the group. Investigators have now established that not only did the suicide bomber travel to Afghanistan’s Kunar in May 2025, the women had also crossed the border using tampered passports.

 

Not only that, but one of the women had carried the suicide vest from Bajaur to Islamabad, and handed it over to another woman in the group. “They are all indoctrinated. The whole family is radicalised,” a senior investigator said.
As investigators dig deeper into the working and operations of IS-Khorasan, there is a realisation that its network is far bigger and more spread out than previously thought — from the Middle East to Central Asian Republics, and onwards into Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They use cryptocurrency for money transfer and employ encrypted communication apps, making their communications very hard to break.
Based on what they have learned, investigators now consider IS-Khorasan a much bigger threat than the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in terms of its capability for mass killing, compartmentalisation, commitment to ideology, resources and the sophistication of their operations.

The committee classified REEVs, essentially series hybrids, under HS Code 8703.8090, the same category as BEVs, on the basis that propulsion is provided solely by an electric motor, with the onboard internal combustion engine (ICE) functioning as a generator.
However, the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) has termed the matter a case of misdeclaration under the Customs Act, 1969, and raised the issue with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
It noted that the importer declared the vehicle under HS Code 8703.8090, attracting a 25 per cent duty under the Fifth Schedule, whereas the exporter at the port of origin in China declared it under HS Code 8703.6023, which carries a 50pc duty.

Seek review of HS code for range-extended electric vehicles

According to PAMA, HS 8703.8090 applies to pure electric vehicles, while 8703.6023 covers hybrid vehicles.
The association argues that a vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, even if used as a generator, cannot be considered a pure electric vehicle and therefore should not qualify for incentives intended for zero-emission vehicles.
PAMA further said the inclusion of an ICE potentially contravenes the National Electric Vehicle Policy, which restricts incentives to all-battery vehicles operating solely on onboard battery charge without any combustion engine.
The association maintained that the dispute involves both classification and fiscal benefits. It argued that if there was no difference in duty, the classification under either of the two mentioned HS codes would be irrelevant.
The customs ruling relied heavily on the source of propulsion. However, industry representatives contend that the presence of an ICE generator — reportedly constituting at least 15pc of the vehicle’s value — makes the product distinct from a customary electric vehicle.
PAMA has called for the ruling to be suspended and reviewed to ensure that fiscal concessions are limited to genuine zero-emission vehicles and that market distortions are avoided.
An assembler pointed out that REEVs typically feature a 45-litre fuel tank, emission levels and fuel efficiency comparable to hybrids when not externally charged. He also noted that exporting countries and UNECE regulations classify REEVs as hybrids.
While the Customs Classification Committee stated that its ruling was confined to tariff classification — and acknowledged that the World Customs Organisation is expected to assign a separate HS code for REEVs by 2028 — the decision to extend BEV-level fiscal incentives rests with the federal government and cabinet.
Currently, completely built-up (CBU) BEVs below 50kWh attract 25pc customs duty and 12.5pc GST, while completely knocked-down (CKD) BEVs benefit from one per cent duty on specific parts, 10pc CKD duty, 25pc duty on its localised parts, one per cent GST and zero federal excise duty — incentives aimed at promoting zero-emission vehicles without combustion engines.
The assembler said industry representatives have warned that extending these same concessions to REEVs could significantly distort the market, trigger a surge in low-duty REEV CBU imports at a fraction of duty, and undermine the economic viability of CKD operations across ICE, HEV, PHEV and BEV segments.
He said this classification issue has emerged at a time when the Auto Policy 2026-31 is being discussed with respect to future tariff structures, sales tax treatment and concessions for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, REEV and battery electric vehicles.
He said automakers are awaiting clarity from the Engineering Development Board (EDB) and the Ministry of Industries and Production, especially as the upcoming policy will require alignment with IMF commitments, federal cabinet approval and consensus among key stakeholders.

The protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points in Gilgit, calling for action against the culprits. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after the authorities assured them that steps would be taken to arrest the individuals responsible for offending religious sensibilities.
The arrests came during a crackdown against “elements spreading communal hatred and blasphemous material” on social media, according to a police statement.
“Police took action und­er a zero-tolerance policy against elements offending religious sentiments or undermining harmony through social media,” the statement said.
Police did not name the four arrested individuals. The authorities have requested the public to cooperate with police in identifying such elements.
According to a separate statement, police arrested a resident of Gil­git’s Naumal area on a charge of sharing “derogatory content” on social media. A case was registered against him under sections 298 and 153 of the PPC and also under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Caretaker home minister Sajid Ali Baig said at a press conference that the government would carry out a thorough investigation to nab the people involved in stoking disharmony and “exemplary punishment” would be given to them.

A notification issued by the National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday said that in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 54 read with clause (3) of Article 56 of the Constitution, the president has summoned both Houses of Parliament to assemble together at the Parliament House in Islamabad on March 2 (Monday) at 10:30am.
Earlier, a post on the Presidency’s X account stated that he had approved the summary for convening the session.
The post also said that the session would be convened at 3pm on March 2. Later, the National Assembly Secretariat issued its notification, in which the time was revised to 10:30am.
The session is being convened in continuation of the practice of a joint sitting behind held at the start of every parliamentary year.
According to Article 56 of the Constitution, the president addresses both Houses of parliament at the start of the first session of each parliamentary year.
This will be President Zardari’s ninth address to a joint session of Parliament in the capacity of a president.
During his address, he is expected to outline national priorities, democratic stability, constitutional supremacy and sustainable economic development.
His speech is also expected to cover the regional and global situation, terrorism and the resolve and commitment to eradicate it.
It is also expected that President Zardari could be ‘harsh’ towards the government, as in the recent past he has criticised some of its policies and complained that it did not take ruling allies, including the PPP, on board in the decision-making process.
One reflection of this stance was seen when the president recently returned some important government bills without his consent, despite them having been passed by both Houses of Parliament.</p><small>2026-02-25 20:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251917099293e82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975691/iran-sees-good-outlook-for-talks-with-us-as-negotiating-team-heads-to-geneva' target='_blank'><strong>Iran sees ‘good outlook’ for talks with US as negotiating team heads to Geneva</strong></a><br><p>Iran sees the chance of a good outcome from a third round of talks with the United States, its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday, as a delegation left for Geneva for negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
A senior US official said on Monday that envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are slated to meet with the Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Thursday.
The two countries resumed negotiations over the long-disputed nuclear programme earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East ahead of possible strikes on the Islamic Republic.
Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked.
Trump on February 19 said he was giving Tehran about 10 to 15 days to make a deal.
“In relation to the talks, we see a good outlook, tomorrow in the meeting that Dr Araqchi will hold in Geneva … we have tried, with the guidance of the supreme leader, to manage this process to get out of the no war, no peace situation,” Pezeshkian said in comments carried by state media.
Araqchi said on Tuesday that a deal with the US was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”.
Meanwhile, Witkoff told a private gathering that the Trump administration is demanding any nuclear deal with Iran should remain in effect indefinitely, Axios has reported, citing a US official and two others with knowledge of the comments.
The US and Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel’s existence.
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb.
Vance’s warning
Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region while threatening military strikes if Tehran does not reach a deal to solve a longstanding dispute over its nuclear programme.
US Vice President JD Vance told Iran on Wednesday to take Washington’s threats of military action “seriously,” a day after President Donald Trump appeared to build the case for war in his State of the Union address.
As US forces mass in the Middle East, Trump claimed in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that Iran was seeking to develop missiles that can strike the United States.
Trump also accused Iran of having “sinister nuclear ambitions” and working to rebuild a nuclear programme that was targeted by US strikes last year.
Vance told Fox News that while Trump was going to try to “accomplish it diplomatically,” the US president also had the “right” to use military action.
“You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” said Vance.
“The president has a number of other tools at his disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. He’s shown a willingness to use them and I hope the Iranians take it seriously in the negotiations tomorrow because that’s certainly what the president prefers.”
His comments came as the United States announced fresh sanctions targeting Iran, pressing on with what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign.</p><small>2026-02-25 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25232626750414a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975656/modi-addresses-knesset-says-india-stands-firmly-with-israel-after-oct-7-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Modi addresses Knesset, says India stands ‘firmly’ with Israel after Oct 7 attack</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi told lawmakers in Jerusalem on Wednesday that India stands “firmly” with Israel following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023.
Modi also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a two-day visit aimed at deepening trade and defence ties that has drawn criticism at home.
“I … carry with me the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7,” Modi said in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
“We feel your pain, we share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly with full conviction in this moment and beyond.”
In his speech, Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the more than two-year-long Israeli onslaught.

 

But he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.
Modi also told Israeli lawmakers that his country’s economic growth and Israel’s leadership in technological innovation formed a “natural foundation for our forward-looking partnership”.
“I see a lot of synergies in areas such as quantum technologies, semiconductors and artificial intelligence,” he added.
It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister since he took office in 2014.
‘A real friendship’
Earlier on Wednesday, a red carpet was rolled out at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and Modi was greeted with a hug by Netanyahu as he disembarked the plane.
“The two leaders share a special and a personal relationship,” Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Netanyahu’s office, said in a video posted on X.
“The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance as we are partners in innovation, security and a shared strategic vision,” she added.







Netanyahu’s office said the two right-wing leaders held a private meeting after the welcoming ceremony, with the Israeli premier hailing “a real friendship”.
In a post on X, Modi described the meeting as “excellent”.
“We discussed a wide range of topics aimed at deepening and strengthening the bilateral relations between our two countries,” he said.
The pair “held an in-depth conversation about major developments in the region”, he added.







Modi is also scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog during the visit.
New Delhi has steadily expanded cooperation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cybersecurity sectors, while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East.
Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025.
Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014.
Criticism at home
Modi first visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
In 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor — to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which responded with a devastating onslaught on the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians.
Months after his 2017 visit to Israel, Modi travelled to Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority.
His current visit has sparked criticism at home.
Senior Congress party figure Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — posted on social media on Wednesday that she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” during his address to the Israeli parliament.







Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu.
He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”.
“On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled.







Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

Sri Lanka needed an emphatic win to stay alive but instead exited with a whimper, limping to 107-8 chasing New Zealand’s 168-7.
A win for New Zealand against England on Friday at the same R. Premadasa stadium would see them top the Super Eights group and qualify for the semi-finals along with Harry Brook’s side.
A defeat would open the door for Pakistan, who would probably need a big win against Sri Lanka in Kandy on Saturday to sneak through on net run rate.
Sri Lanka were never in the chase as Matt Henry dismissed their leading batsman Pathum Nissanka with the first ball of the innings.
Henry also removed Chairth Asalanka with the first ball of his second over to leave Sri Lanka in trouble at 6-2.
Sri Lanka crawled to 20-2 at the end of the six-over power play, the lowest in the competition and Sri Lanka’s second lowest ever in T20 internationals.
Part-time spinner Rachin Ravindra found a turn to put the game beyond Sri Lanka with a career-best 4-27.
Ravindra had a charging Kusal Mendis stumped and then removed Pavan Rathnayake in a similar fashion in the same over as the sellout crowd was stunned into silence.
“It is very embarrassing to disappoint the home crowd,” said Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka.
“We started really well, but to be honest, the Santner-McConchie and that partnership, it was a good one, which took the game away from us.” New Zealand earlier recovered from a mini-collapse to reach 168-7.
“I think it was obviously a nice score there with the amount of spin on the ball. They squeezed us a lot,” said New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner.
Sri Lanka were right in the game as New Zealand slumped from 84-3 to 84-6 in the space of six deliveries.
But an 84-run stand off just 47 deliveries for the seventh wicket between Cole McConchie and Santner enabled them to set a tricky target on a turning pitch.
Skipper Santner top-scored with 47 off 26 balls with two fours and four sixes.
McConchie, recalled to the side, posted an unbeaten 31 off 23 balls.
New Zealand were struggling to read Maheesh Theekshana as the spinner claimed 3-9 in his first three overs.
New Zealand blasted 70 off the last four overs, including 21 off the final one from Theekshana.
Pace bowler Dushmantha Chameera finished with 3-38.</p><small>2026-02-25 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25214405290505a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975701/jailed-pti-leaders-urge-cjp-to-look-into-matter-of-imrans-health-see-that-justice-is-done' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders urge CJP to look into matter of Imran’s health, ‘see that justice is done’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Five senior PTI leaders incarcerated in Lahore’s Koth Lakhpat Jail have written an open letter, urging the chief justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi to again look into the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and treatment and “see that justice is done”.
Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema made the appeal in a joint handwritten open letter, which was shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday.
They also drew a comparison between the events surrounding the jailed ex-prime minister’s treatment today and that of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif in 2019.
Nawaz, who was serving a prison sentence granted by an accountability court that found him guilty of corruption in the Al Azizia case in 2019, had been allowed to travel to London for treatment after he was diagnosed with an immune system disorder. Prior to that, he was also provided treatment at the hospital in Pakistan.
The five PTI leaders said in their letter that in 2019, “when Nawaz Sharif was shifted to Services Hospital, Lahore for low platelet count, we as the sitting government ensured that he should get proper treatment for his ailment”.
“His personal physician Dr Adnan was part of all meetings conducted by the medical board. We even personally asked Mian Nawaz Sharif whether he was satisfied with his treatment,” the leaders said.
They added that Nawaz was also asked whether he wanted to be treated by a physician of his choice and assured that the relevant doctor would be called.
“His family and legal counsel had free access to him,” the letter further stated. “We are sure that if you ask Mian Nawaz Sharif personally, he will not refute our claims,” it added.
The leaders recalled that Nawaz was also permitted to go to England for treatment.
Comparing those events with the situation today, the five leaders said that Imran, a former premier, has “faced obstructions of all forms in his treatment”.
They accused the incumbent government of carrying out a “cloak and dagger activity”, saying: “First, the present government did not accept that he was unwell and then when the news was leaked from Pims about his central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), the government blustered around with all sorts of obnoxious statements. His consultants’ rights were trampled […] and his family was not granted access [to him]; his lawyer and personal physicians could not meet him.”
The jailed leaders said that Imran was taken to the hospital for the administration of a second injection on Tuesday, “but his family was not informed.“
Only PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan “received a message at 2am that he had been given his second injection”.
“The government should be ashamed of itself. This callous attitude will never improve the situation. We, however, think this Form-47 government does not want any political stability as they know that they never won the [2024] elections, and they do not want to lose their chairs (positions) as they have no chance of winning again,” the leaders maintained.
The health condition of Imran, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
The concerns have been heightened with restrictions in place on meetings with Imran at the jail.
However, earlier this month, a two-member Supreme Court bench led by CJP Afridi had allowed Imran’s lawyer Salman Safdar to meet him, declaring him amicus curiae.
After the meeting, Safdar had submitted a report to the SC, which said “only 15 per cent” vision was left in Imran’s right eye.
Government, however, has been issuing statements to allay these concerns, with the law minister stating at one instance that “if he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6”.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Today, the PTI approached the Supreme Court seeking the medical treatment of jailed party founder at a hospital of his choice, along with access to his personal physicians.</p><small>2026-02-25 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25210404cffbac2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975700/fm-dar-to-undertake-3-day-saudi-visit-will-attend-oic-session-on-israel-pursuing-west-bank-annexation-fo' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar to undertake 3-day Saudi visit, will attend OIC session on Israel pursuing West Bank annexation: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will embark on Thursday on a three-day visit — from February 26-28 — to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Open-Ended Extraordinary Ministerial Session of the Organisation of Islamic Council (OIC) Executive Committee, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The FO said in a statement on Wednesday that the ministerial session would be held on February 26 in Jeddah “to consider the illegal decisions of the Israeli occupation authorities aimed at expanding settlements, pursuing annexation, and attempting to impose Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank”.







The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
The move is in violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
At the ministerial session in Jeddah, FM Dar would share Pakistan’s perspective on the “latest illegal measures by Israel to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called ‘state land’“, the FO said.
He would also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the FO statement said, adding that he would also “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities”.
Earlier, several Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
“We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” a joint statement by the countries said.
The Palestinian Presidency has also slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, according to Wafa news agency.
Palestinian group Hamas has also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.</p><small>2026-02-25 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25201347aa341dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975697/4-cops-martyred-2-injured-in-firing-by-unidentified-assailants-on-patrol-squad-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>4 cops martyred, 2 injured in firing by unidentified assailants on patrol squad in KP’s Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>BAJAUR: Four cops were martyred and two others were wounded when unidentified attackers opened fire at a patrol party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Wednesday evening.
Khar Police Station House Officer Gul Zada told Dawn that the attackers targeted the Ababeel Squad — an exclusive patrolling force — at the time of Iftar near the Nawai Kallay area.
The squad was on a routine patrol when unidentified attackers opened fire on them, he said, adding that four policemen died on the spot while two others were “seriously injured”.
Separately, Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Khan told Dawn that the personnel were on their way to the Bajaur police lines from Inayat Kallay bazaar, with their duty hours about to end, when they were attacked.
As a result, four cops — Yar Zada, Dawood Khan, Imran Khan and Siraj Khan — were martyred while Irshad Khan and Azizur Rehman were injured, he added.
SHO Gul Zada said the injured policemen were immediately taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar for treatment.
Meanwhile, a police team led by senior officials immediately rushed to the site of the incident and launched a search operation to hunt down the attackers, who had fled after the shooting, Israr Khan said.
The attack in Bajaur took place a day after seven police personnel were martyred in two attacks in KP, where law enforcers have increasingly come under attack in recent days.
On Tuesday, six law enforcement personnel, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Asad Mehmood, were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Kohat district.
A police officer told Dawn that the DSP, an inspector and four constables were martyred when their vehicle was ambushed near Shakardara Road while transporting two individuals for a court appearance. One of the two individuals being transported was also killed in the attack. The assailants later set the vehicle on fire.
In a separate incident, a constable was martyred after unidentified men opened fire in the Mughal Khel village of Wana tehsil in Lower South Waziristan.
On Monday, three Federal Constabulary men were martyred when terrorists attacked rescue teams in the Karak district. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur district resulted in the martyrdom of 11 security personnel.</p><small>2026-02-25 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25185359fb39d81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975690/34-terrorists-killed-in-separate-engagements-in-kp-and-balochistan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>34 terrorists killed in separate engagements in KP and Balochistan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday that a total of 34 terrorists were killed in separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that over the last few days, security forces had conducted a series of “high tempo, intelligence-driven operations” aimed at eliminating Indian proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza.
Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process.
“It is significant to highlight that the killed kharji has been identified as an Afghan national,” the statement said.
It went on to say that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, three militants were killed, it said.
According to ISPR, 10 terrorists were killed in Narmi Khel in KP’s Bannu district while 12 were killed in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali.
It went on to say that troops also conducted an IBO in Sambaza in Balochistan’s Zhob district.
“After an intense fire exchange, eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were successfully neutralised,” it said.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it said.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers,” the statement said, adding that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists.
The statement concluded that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for their successful operations against Fitna Al Hindustan and Fitna Al Khwarij terrorists.
He said that the killing of the terrorists and the recovery of weapons reflected the professional performance of security forces.
He stressed that the security forces and law enforcement agencies should continue their efforts to eradicate terrorism in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“There should be no let-up in operations against terrorists who are active with external backing, to ensure national security and the protection of the people,” he said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, also paid tribute to Pakistan’s security forces.
He further stated that Pakistan’s security forces continued to achieve battlefield successes against terrorist organisations each day. He reaffirmed that the government was determined to eliminate terrorism from the country.
Earlier this week, security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during IBOs in Balochistan and KP.</p><small>2026-02-25 14:46</small></div><hr>
