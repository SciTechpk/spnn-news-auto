The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar — who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting —  requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
 


A joint session of both the NA and Senate standing committees on law and justice was then summoned for 2pm to discuss the amendment.
During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said that debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
“I would suggest that instead of sending it to the committee, let this Senate be treated as a committee as a whole,” he said, suggesting the bill be debated by all individuals. He further said that the opposition had received the draft today and had also not yet read a word of it.
“We cannot debate something we have not read,” he said.
Law minister details key clauses
Meanwhile, the law minister said that the bill would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
 
 

He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
Federal govt approves draft
Shortly before the Senate session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had chaired the cabinet meeting via video link from Azerbaijan, according to state-run PTV News.
“The federal cabinet approved the draft for the 27th Constitutional Amendment and welcomed it to the fullest extent,” it had added.
“Everyone made joint efforts for the 27th Constitutional Amendment for strengthening the Centre’s relations with the provinces and the country’s wider interests,” the premier was quoted as saying. He commended the law minister’s efforts, as well as those of the attorney general of Pakistan.
 






Shehbaz noted that he had taken PML-N President Nawaz Sharif into confidence for the amendments and sought his guidance on them. “I also took President Asif Ali Zardari into confidence regarding the Amendment and we are deeply grateful to him for their approval,” the premier said.
He went on to specifically thank PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and heads of other allied parties who held discussions with him and “strongly supported” the draft. The prime minister noted that Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan, PML-Zia head Ijazul Haq and other politicians were also apprised of the legislation.
He stressed that everyone must work together for the country’s progress and prosperity.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the ANP and the PML-Zia.
After the federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, the law minister had briefed the media on some of the key features of the draft and informed that the bill would be tabled in the Senate.
Moreover, Tarar recalled that at the time of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the MQM-P had contacted the prime minister and the PML-N seeking changes to Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish local governments (LGs).
“They had introduced a bill in the Senate, which was referred to a committee and on the directives of the premier, I, as the law minister, also gave a note in its support,” Tarar said.
“As that bill is already pending, the cabinet has also directed me today that when today’s bill is referred to the committee after being presented in the senate, the committee should also mull over [the one tabled by the MQM-P],” he said.
Tarar said that the government would try to convince its allied partners to develop a consensus on this bill so it could be passed, adding that a recent resolution by the Punjab Assembly regarding LGs would also be discussed.
He further said that Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) leaders, in their meeting with PM Shehbaz earlier this week, had directed his attention to a bill pertaining to an increase in the seats for the Balochistan Assembly.
“So both these bills, which are already pending before the law and justice standing committee, will be debated,” the minister said.
“Pakistan is going through very tough circumstances, and I think the country’s greatest need today is political consensus and political stability,” the law minister stressed.
The proposed constitutional tweaks have been heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians, who termed them an attempt to revoke provincial rights granted in the 18th Amendment.
The federal cabinet meeting was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed due to PM Shehbaz’s commitments in Azerbaijan, sources in the PM Office said. However, some were of the opinion that the meeting was put off due to a lack of consensus between the ruling PML-N and the PPP over the Amendment.
The PPP has said it would support amendments to Article 243, which defines the powers of the armed forces, but has rejected proposals related to provinces’ shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and any rollback of the 18th Amendment.
The PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) yesterday decided that it “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed” — a proposal also mulled during the 26th Amendment discussions last year.
The MQM-P presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong and autonomous LGs across the country. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam–Fazl (JUI-F), which met with an MQM-P delegation on Thursday, has opposed any amendment that would reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081535318650ec9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953890/funeral-of-judicial-independence-how-the-27th-constitutional-amendment-bill-changes-the-structure-of-pakistans-judiciary' target='_blank'><strong>‘Funeral of judicial independence’: How the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill changes the structure of Pakistan’s judiciary</strong></a><br><p>Barely had the dust settled on the 26th Amendment when another constitutional storm began to brew in Islamabad. The government’s freshly tabled 27th Amendment promises, on paper, to “streamline” governance — through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates, and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.

Key changes proposed to judicial structure:

Creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, with its own chief justice and judges
FCC to assume SC’s most significant powers; SC to be downgraded to apex court for civil and criminal appeals only
FCC decisions to be binding on all courts, including the SC


At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court: the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the Supreme Court (SC), senior High Court (HC) judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice. Judges would retire at 68.
The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.”
Moreover, the FCC would take over the Supreme Court’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the President’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.
Beneath all the bureaucratic phrasing lies a familiar unease: is this reform, or a fundamental reinvention of Pakistan’s judicial architecture?
With the ink on the last amendment still contested in court, the legal fraternity isn’t buying the calm. Lawyers across the country have now entered the debate, warning that the proposed changes could redraw — or perhaps blur — the boundaries between the judiciary, the executive, and the federation itself.
 






Altering the social contract
Abdul Moiz Jaferii described the proposed amendment in stark terms, saying a draft of it “should be sent to North Korea, so that Kim Jong Un can read it to his children as a lullaby.”
“This is the stuff of tinpot dictatorships,” he added, drawing parallels to “sub-Saharan African regimes where the rule of law has never taken root.”
Jaferii emphasised that Pakistan has historically maintained a system of laws and justice, “as deficient as it may be,” along with a warrant of precedence and democratic governance. But, he argued, a regime whose election is in doubt and which cannot satisfactorily address questions about its legitimacy is “delegitimising the state itself.”
“Our social contract is being altered by people who know they were not elected into office legitimately,” he said. “The fabric of the state is being stitched up to allow for this power grab to continue.”
 


He criticised senior figures in politics, noting that “a few old men with ulterior motives are rolling back the rules of the game in a country where the vast majority of the population finds nothing in common with their age, their politics or their principles.”
“The nation of smartphone natives has been made subject to the dial-up dreams of septuagenarian landline merchants,” he concluded.
The funeral of judicial independence
For lawyer Basil Nabi Malik, “If the 26th amendment was the death of the independence of the judiciary, the 27th amendment is its funeral.”
“In essence, this amendment seeks to strip the judiciary of the remaining vestiges of independence that one could possibly conceive to remain within it. It straitjackets judges into forced consent when it comes to transfers, nominations or appointments, failing which they would be retired, firmly retains and expands executive control over judicial functions, and even secures the selection of the first batch of FCC judges to make sure they fit their deemed ‘criteria’.”
According to Malik, the age of FCC judges has been increased, while that of SC judges remains the same, thereby adding a reward and punitive element to the selection or non selection to the FCC.
“All in all, it is marvellous invention. The institution which makes the law controls the institution that is supposed to interpret it and ensure it protects the citizens rights,” he said.
When a person is aggrieved by the government, he said, they are supposed to be happy going to a court controlled by that government against that very government. And they need not complain about it. “After all, what could possibly go wrong? How could such a court not be inclined to side with the government? How could one even think that this is a bad idea?”
“It is said that all is well that ends well, but this, unfortunately, will not end well by any means.”
Great blow to the Constitution
Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig too warned that the 27th Amendment “spells the final death knell of an independent judiciary.” He said that while the 26th Amendment had reconstituted the Judicial Commission of Pakistan by giving members associated with the executive a majority, the 27th Amendment goes further by creating a Federal Constitutional Court.
“Not content with an executive-dominated Judicial Commission,” Baig explained, “the Amendment also provides that the first Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister. The other judges of the Constitutional Court would then be appointed by the President on the prime minister’s advice, and in consultation with their handpicked Chief Justice.”
Baig argued that the 27th Amendment “deals a greater blow to our Constitution than any change introduced by dictatorial regimes.” He added that with the creation of the Constitutional Court and its packing with judges handpicked by the government, “the polis has finally fallen apart.”</p><small>2025-11-08 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081512426c1d2d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953888/how-does-the-27th-constitutional-amendment-bill-change-the-military-leadership-structure' target='_blank'><strong>How does the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill change the military leadership structure?</strong></a><br><p>The government presented the much anticipated draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the Senate on Saturday afternoon. The far-reaching legislative proposal, among other changes, rewrites Article 243 of the Constitution, creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces and abolishing the long-standing office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC).
It also vests broader, constitutionally protected powers and privileges in the country’s top military leadership.

Article 243 governs the relationship between the prime minister (as head of the federal government) and the president (as the head of state) in relation to the control and command of the armed forces.
Key changes proposed to Article 243:

Army chief to be recognised as Chief of Defence Forces, positioned at top of Pakistan’s armed services
Office of CJCSC to be abolished
Establishing a Commander of National Strategic Command position
President to appoint army, naval, air chiefs on advice of premier
Life-long constitutional protection to be provided to 5-star rank officers


According to the draft tabled in the Senate today, the amendment would make the Chief of the Army Staff the constitutionally recognised Chief of the Defence Forces, effectively merging the army chief’s current authority with a new overarching title that places him at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.
 


It also proposes establishing a Commander of the National Strategic Command and defining extensive entitlements for officers elevated to the rare five-star ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet.
Under the new language, the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, would appoint the army, naval and air chiefs, with the army chief serving “concurrently as Chief of the Defence Forces”.
The draft further provides that the Commander of the National Strategic Command, a position overseeing the country’s nuclear and strategic assets, would be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the army chief, and must come from within the army.
A separate set of clauses grants life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star rank. Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47. Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
Their post-command duties and remuneration would be determined by the federal government and the president on the prime minister’s advice.
While presenting the draft in the Senate today, Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal, which “is not a rank or an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure”.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes.
“These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
Tarar noted that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but the Parliament’s, adding that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025.
“The present CJCSC is also our hero; it [the position] will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
However, the minister continued, there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
A brewing storm
Government officials and some lawmakers describe the measure as a technical update meant to modernise command arrangements and regularise extraordinary promotions made in recent months. But the proposal has set off a storm of political debate in Islamabad, with opposition parties and civil-rights groups warning that it could tilt the balance of power further toward the military at the expense of civilian institutions.
The amendment’s political context has fueled controversy. The proposal surfaced earlier this month amid delicate negotiations within the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz coalition. It became public when Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari disclosed on November 3 that a PML-N delegation, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, had sought the PPP’s support for a package of constitutional changes.
The timing of the introduction of the bill drew further scrutiny because the draft’s changes to Article 243 coincide with the extraordinary promotion of Gen Asim Munir to the rank of Field Marshal after the India-Pakistan confrontation of May 2025. That promotion, the second in Pakistan’s history, has been cited by government officials as a reason to formalise such ranks in law.
If approved, the office of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, long regarded as the principal inter-service coordinating body, would be abolished on Nov 27 — the date on which incumbent CJCSC Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza is set to retire. Gen Mirza would hence become the last Chairman of Joint Services in the country’s history.
For now, the 27th Amendment Bill sits at the centre of an increasingly charged debate over the limits of civilian oversight and the military’s constitutional role. If enacted, it would mark the most consequential revision of Pakistan’s defence command structure since the constitutional battles of the 1980s and could redefine, in law, the delicate balance that has long shaped the country’s civil-military relations.</p><small>2025-11-08 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08142837c453560.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953885/silence-or-surrender-the-27th-amendment-and-the-unmaking-of-justice' target='_blank'><strong>Silence or surrender: The 27th Amendment and the unmaking of justice</strong></a><br><p>“The judiciary must be independent of every other power; otherwise, there is no liberty, no security, no justice.” — John Adams
Centuries after John Adams spoke these words, their resonance feels almost prophetic today, as the government tables the 27th Constitutional Amendment. For those who have witnessed the slow, deliberate erosion of judicial independence in Pakistan, this moment feels less like reform and more like resignation.
The judiciary, already weakened and weary after the 26th Amendment, now stands on the precipice of collapse. What is being framed as an administrative restructuring — the creation of a separate constitutional court — in truth, threatens to hollow out the very authority of an institution that has long stood as the final line of defence between power and the people.
It is not merely an amendment to a document; it is an assault on the idea that justice must stand apart from politics. The judiciary is not an accessory to government; it is the conscience of the nation. When that conscience begins to fade, when its voice trembles under pressure, the entire structure of liberty begins to shake.
The fire we’ve forgotten
I remember vividly why I, and so many of my generation, chose this path. We are the first-generation lawyers — young once, idealistic, and uncertain about the future — but we came into this profession not for wealth or prestige, not to wear robes or titles. We were drawn to the law because we had seen something extraordinary: the courage of those who stood in the streets during the movement of 2009. The lawyers, judges, and ordinary citizens who rose to defend the Constitution then did so not for themselves but for a belief — a belief that justice must forever remain beyond the reach of politics and power.
 
 

That movement was not about personalities; it was about a principle. It restored a dignity that had been stripped away from our courts and reminded a nation that justice could still prevail when conscience awakened. The videos still available on YouTube show us those days — the chants, the tear gas, the arrests, the sheer defiance etched on every face. People carried nothing but the Constitution in their hands, yet it was enough to move mountains. The law, in that moment, stood taller than fear.
It was a time when truth walked unarmed, and yet, it conquered.
Today, that same spirit feels painfully distant. The silence of those entrusted with defending the judiciary now hangs heavy over every courtroom and every lawyer’s heart. We had placed our hopes in the judges — believing they would guard the independence of the bench, believing that when the moment came, they would remember the blood and courage that restored this institution. And yet, their silence has become deafening. It is not neutrality — it is surrender. It is the quiet undoing of everything that was once fought for.
Our silence in this defining moment will be a grave injustice and a treason with the blood of those who shed theirs in the 2009 movement. It will be a betrayal of their courage, their conviction, and their sacrifice. Those who once stood for justice, who faced batons, tear gas, and imprisonment, did not suffer so that we could fall silent today. To remain unmoved now is to desecrate the memory of that struggle and the spirit that once lifted this nation. Silence in this hour is not just inaction — it is complicity. It is the surrender of the very ideals we once promised to protect.
But this is not the end. Not yet. There is still time to reclaim what was won with such sacrifice. There is still time for courage, humility, and reflection. We owe it to those who stood before us, and to those who will come after us, to raise our voices once more — to remind those in power that the judiciary does not belong to them. It belongs to the people, to the Constitution, and to every citizen who still believes in fairness and truth.
History does not forget such moments. No political party will be remembered for the amendments it passed or the power it grasped. But history will remember the silence — or the courage — of those who were entrusted with justice and chose how to respond in this hour of testing. The question is not whether power will prevail (it always tries to). The question is whether conscience will resist, whether courage will still find a voice when silence feels safer.
This is the hour of conscience
The choice before us could not be clearer. Either we allow this moment to pass in quiet resignation, or we rise, as those before us did, to defend the sanctity of justice. The judiciary’s independence is not a ceremonial value; it is the living heart of democracy. When it falters, the people lose their last defence against tyranny. Every lawyer, every judge, and every citizen must understand — the fight for judicial independence is not a fight for the judiciary alone; it is a fight for the soul of constitution and country itself.
 
 

To stand up now is not to be reckless; it is to be responsible. It is to remind ourselves that independence of judiciary is not merely a clause in a Constitution — it is the beating heart of a free people. When the judiciary trembles, the nation’s conscience shakes with it. When we remain silent, we allow that tremor to grow into collapse. The independence of the judiciary was never gifted; it was earned — with struggle, with resilience, and with blood. And it will survive only if we defend it with the same fire that once lit our streets.
Because at the end of all laws and amendments, it is not power that endures — it is principle. Power fades, regimes fall, but the courage to defend justice, even when it costs you everything, becomes eternal. The history of this nation will not be written by those who silenced dissent, but by those who dared to speak when silence was safer.
As Martin Luther King Jr reminded us, “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</p><small>2025-11-08 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08140247896b0e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953800/pakistan-look-to-prove-a-point-in-odi-series-decider-against-sa' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan look to prove a point in ODI series decider against SA</strong></a><br><p>FAISALABAD: After a scrappy win in the opening One-day International against South Africa, Pakistan’s frailties with both bat and ball resurfaced in the second match. As the three-match series stands level at 1-1, the hosts will have a point to prove when they take the field for the decisive fixture at the Iqbal Stadium on Saturday.
Under newly-appointed ODI captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan stumbled to a two-wicket victory in the series opener, surviving a late collapse to cross the finish line. Two days later, they were undone by South Africa’s left-arm pacer Nandre Burger and veteran opener Quinton de Kock, who combined to seal an emphatic win for the visitors.
For Shaheen and his men, the stakes are high as Faisalabad’s Iqbal Stadium — hosting its first international series in 17 years — prepares for another packed crowd. A complete all-round performance will be required if Pakistan are to clinch their first home ODI series win since 2022, when they defeated the same opponents away from home.
With Pakistan fielding a full-strength squad against a largely second-string South African side, pride as much as points will be on the line. For that to materialise, Shaheen and batting mainstay Babar Azam — the side’s two senior-most players — will need to produce match-defining performances.
Babar, who had shown signs of regaining form with a half-century in the T20I decider last week, has managed scores of only seven and 11 in the two ODIs. Shaheen, meanwhile, has struggled to make an impact with the ball, taking just one wicket in the series so far, and has found himself under scrutiny in his first assignment as captain.
Pakistan’s fielding has also been a concern, with dropped catches and misfields proving costly in the previous match. The lapses meant that half-centuries from Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha and Mohammad Nawaz — which had rescued Pakistan from a shaky 22-3 to a respectable 269-9 — went in vain.
“I think Saim and Agha did really well, and their partnership helped us,” Shaheen said after the second ODI. “After losing three wickets early, we thought 270 was a good score, but dropped catches cost us. We will come back strongly.”
Babar, too, will be aware of the expectations of Faisalabad’s cricket-hungry crowd, many of whom have turned up in large numbers across the first two games. A strong innings from the former captain could well anchor Pakistan’s batting effort, provided the middle order builds on recent signs of stability.
Pakistan’s management, led by coach Mike Hesson, faces a few tactical decisions. The team used eight bowling options in the last match, reflecting Hesson’s all-rounder-centric approach that has drawn some criticism. While the strategy adds depth to the batting order, it has occasionally left the side short of a cutting edge with the ball.
Leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, who took 3-53 in the opening match, could return to the XI after being left out for the second ODI. There is also a chance of an appearance for left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram, whose variation could test South Africa’s middle order.
The visitors, meanwhile, have been buoyed by de Kock’s return to form. The wicketkeeper-batter’s unbeaten 123 in the second ODI — his 22nd career century — underlined his experience and timing. Burger’s four-wicket burst with the new ball exposed Pakistan’s vulnerability against pace, while stand-in captain Matthew Breetzke has shown steady form at the top.
South Africa’s attack, featuring Burger, Nqabayomzi Peter and Lungi Ngidi, will once again test Pakistan’s consistency, while spinners Bjorn Fortuin and George Linde may come into play if the surface slows down under lights.

The animals have killed a record 13 across the country since April, with a steady flow of reports of bears entering homes, roaming near schools and rampaging in supermarkets.
“We hear news almost every day about people being attacked or injured,” said 28-year-old Kakeru Matsuhashi, a traditional “Matagi” hunter, as he walked through a forest clutching a knife.
“It’s becoming something that feels personal, and it’s simply frightening,” he added in the northern prefecture of Akita, an area hit by a series of attacks.
This year, the number of fatalities is double the previous record of 2023-24, with five months of the fiscal year still to go.
Data is patchy from certain regions, but in recent years, Japan has seen among the highest number of fatal attacks globally.

Keiji Minatoya, also from Akita, knows this too well — a bear leapt from his garage, pinned him to the ground and sank its teeth into his face in 2023.
“I was thinking: ‘This is how I die’”, said 68-year-old Minatoya, who managed to escape and take refuge inside his home.
The government is now scrambling to deal with the surge in attacks, which scientists say is being driven by a fast-growing bear population combined with this year’s bad acorn harvest, leaving some mountains “overcrowded” with hungry bears.
Troops have been deployed to provide logistical help for trapping and hunting bears, while riot police will be allowed to use rifles to shoot the animals, which can weigh half a tonne and outrun a human.
The victims include a 67-year-old man in Iwate, a region next to Akita, whose body was found outside his home, with animal bite marks and scars.
Hunters were called to the scene and shot a bear near the house.
Also in Iwate, a 60-year-old man is thought to have been attacked while cleaning an outdoor bath at a remote hot spring resort. His body was discovered in nearby woods.
Official data show the number of wounded is also on course to be a record, tallying over 100 people in the six months to September.

‘Overcrowded’ with bears
A major issue is the expanding bear population, which is growing fast due to an abundance of food — including acorns, deer and boars — under the influence of a warming climate, experts say.
Japan’s brown bear population has doubled in three decades, and now stands at around 12,000, while the number of Asian black bears has climbed on the country’s main Honshu island, reaching 42,000, according to a recent government report.
Some mountains have become “overcrowded”, according to Naoki Ohnishi, researcher at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute.
“Put simply, the size of the bear population has gone beyond the capacity of the mountains to hold them,” he said.
 
 

Although rising temperatures have led to more frequent bumper crops of acorns, the nuts still produce good and bad harvests every two to five years as part of their normal crop cycle.
This year, as well as in 2023 — the year Minatoya was attacked — there is a poor supply.
While most bears still stay in the mountains, recent bad harvests have led some — together with their cubs — to wander into towns to look for food, said Shinsuke Koike, professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.
With exposure to humans, cubs in particular become less fearful and develop a taste for farmed produce and common fruits such as persimmon, Koike added.
Steady rural depopulation due to a chronically low birthrate and young people moving to cities has also reduced the human presence at the edges of forests and mountains, blurring the traditional boundaries between people and bears.
“Bear habitats inched closer to human habitats in 2023,” Ohnishi said.
“This year, they are coming a step further because they are starting from where they left off.”
‘Witnessing a disaster’
Hajime Nakae, professor of emergency and critical medicine at the Akita University Hospital, said the frequent bear sightings made him feel like he was “living inside … a safari park for bears”.
The doctor, who has treated bear injuries for three decades, explained the nature of wounds was changing as bears become less afraid of humans.
In encounters years ago, a startled bear may have struck a human in the face before fleeing but now “they charge at you from about 10 metres and then leap at you”.
He said that without meaningful intervention he expected bear injuries to increase and spread to other parts of the nation, adding: “We are witnessing a disaster”.
“Thorough culling” to reduce the number of bears is the only effective way to reduce the risk for local people, researcher Ohnishi said.
Last year, the government added bears to the list of animals subject to population control, reversing protection that had helped bears thrive.
But rural resources are stretched thin and the number of hunters is less than half of what it was in 1980.
As of 2020, the latest statistics available, there were around 220,000, mostly in their 60s or older.
Japan culled more than 9,000 bears in 2023-2024, and over 4,200 between April to September this year.
Akita has alone culled over 1,000 so far.
In the immediate future, Japan’s worries should ease, if only temporarily.
Experts Koike and Ohnishi said hibernation patterns had not shifted and the bears would soon go to sleep for the winter.

Explosions that injured dozens of people during Friday prayers could have been an attack, officials said, with a 17-year-old student the suspected perpetrator.
“Several pieces of supporting evidence were found,” police chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo told a press conference after visiting the victims at a hospital.
“There were written materials and some powder that could have potentially caused an explosion,” he said.
“We are gathering other records, including examining social media and family members to gather all the information.”
The suspected perpetrator, a student at a school next to the mosque, was recovering after undergoing surgery on Friday, Listyo said.

Foreign Office (FO) Spokesman Tahir Andrabi, responding to a question from Dawn, said, “For the record, Pakistan’s last nuclear tests were conducted in May 1998. Our position on nuclear testing is well established and consistent.”
Pakistan has maintained a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing since its last series of tests conducted in response to India’s nuclear tests.
However, Pakistan has not signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, retaining the flexibility to resume testing if its security environment, particularly vis-à-vis India, deteriorates.
“Pakistan has been supporting United Nations General Assembly resolutions calling for a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In contrast, India’s abstentions on these resolutions reflect its ambiguous and questionable intentions on future nuclear testing,” Andrabi said.
The statement came after India cited an earlier remark by US President Donald Trump, who in a recent interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, had claimed that “Pakistan’s been testing” nuclear weapons, a statement Islamabad had earlier chosen not to respond to to avoid offending Washington.
However, the FO broke its silence after India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) referenced Trump’s comment at a media briefing on Friday.
India’s MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan’s history, that is centered around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation. India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan’s record. In this backdrop, we have taken note of President Trump’s comment about Pakistan’s nuclear testing.”
Andrabi dismissed the Indian statement, saying, “India is clearly distorting facts and misrepresenting the remarks of US President Donald Trump. The US side has already clarified its position to the media regarding the statements by the president.”
He emphasised that “Pakistan’s nuclear program operates under a robust command and control structure, comprehensive export controls, and an impeccable record of compliance with the global non-proliferation regime.”
“Allegations of ‘clandestine or illegal nuclear activities’ are baseless, malicious, and part of India’s disinformation campaign aimed at diverting attention from its own irresponsible conduct,” Andrabi said.
The spokesman said India’s record on nuclear safety and security remained “deeply concerning”.
“Over the past several decades, numerous incidents involving the theft and illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material and other radioactive substances have exposed serious deficiencies in India’s ability to safeguard its facilities,” the spokesperson added.
“As recently as last year, radioactive equipment from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, along with the highly radioactive substance Californium (valued at over $100 million) was found on sale in India.”
He said such recurring incidents “point to the existence of a thriving nuclear black market for sensitive and dual-use materials in India”.
“The international community must take serious note of these alarming gaps, which pose a grave threat to both regional and global security,” Andrabi added.</p><small>2025-11-08 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081104058cde4e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953880/info-minister-says-pakistani-troops-jf-17-fighter-jets-to-feature-in-azerbaijans-victory-day-parade' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister says Pakistani troops, JF-17 fighter jets to feature in Azerbaijan’s Victory Day Parade</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets would appear in Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade scheduled for later today.
Since 2020, Victory Day has been observed in Azerbaijan on November 8 to commemorate its victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia.
“Long live Pakistan-Azerbaijan friendship. Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets will be appearing in Azerbaijan’s victory parade today, commemorating the liberation of Karabagh,” he said.
The minister made the comments while responding to a post on social media platform X by Pakistan’s embassy in Baku. The embassy had posted about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who embarked on a visit to the country a day earlier to attend Victory Day celebrations, and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev attending a joint dinner.
 






A day earlier, Pakistan and Azerbaijan had reiterated their resolve to further cement their cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence. The two sides made the pledge during a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Azerbaijan President Aliyev in Baku.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
“The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationship and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence,” says a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to the president of Azerbaijan to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which the latter accepted.
In a late-night post on X, Shehbaz had stated that he was looking forward to the “grand parade”.
Talking about his meeting with President Aliyev, he said the two “reviewed the deep-rooted and fraternal ties between our two countries and agreed to further expand cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity, and defence”.
 






Last month, a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, had landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise.
 






According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aimed to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.</p><small>2025-11-08 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08093142373c66d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953877/pakistan-us-explore-ways-to-develop-economically-entrenched-strategic-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US explore ways to develop ‘economically entrenched strategic partnership’</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Pakistan early on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership“.
The development came as S. Paul Kapur — who assumed charge as the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs on October 22 — met Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at the State Department for what was described as a cordial and forward-looking exchange.
Ambassador Sheikh said the two sides explored practical ways to translate recent high-level political resolve into concrete cooperation.
“We discussed the ways and means of translating the resolve — expressed at the leadership level — of developing Pakistan–US ties into an economically entrenched strategic partnership, through sustained engagement in multiple domains of mutual interest,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, Kapur said it was a “pleasure” to meet the Pakistani envoy.
“We discussed ways to advance the US-Pakistan relationship and make our countries more prosperous and secure,” he said in a post on X.
 






Kapur’s meeting with Ambassador Sheikh comes as Washington and Islamabad recalibrate their relations under US President Donald Trump’s second administration.
After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties.
In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals, and technology sectors.
 
 

For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation.
Late last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Washington’s relationship with New Delhi.
In September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
Trump’s South Asia narrative
Trump has continued to highlight his role in what he calls the prevention of a nuclear war in South Asia following the brief but intense military conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year in May.
During several public remarks, he has claimed that his administration’s swift diplomatic engagement “stopped a nuclear conflict” after the two neighbours exchanged air strikes, and that Pakistan “shot down eight Indian planes” during those clashes.
 
 

While New Delhi has not confirmed Trump’s account, his repeated references to that episode reflect Washington’s renewed interest in South Asian stability — and the value it assigns to maintaining direct communication with both capitals.
Despite the fresh tone, the relationship needs greater effort to sustain its current momentum. Washington continues to view Pakistan through a regional lens — balancing its strategic interests between India and China — while Islamabad seeks broader recognition of its economic and geopolitical relevance.
Analysts note that although the two countries are again speaking of a “strategic partnership“, much will depend on how the rhetoric translates into measurable progress. Both sides must still bridge differences over regional security, trade access, and Pakistan’s deepening engagement with China.
As one observer in Washington noted, “It’s an encouraging start — but what matters now is whether this goodwill can evolve into a sustained, structured partnership.”</p><small>2025-11-08 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/080724583dcdab6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953698/asif-says-talks-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan-over-ceasefire-stands-for-time-being' target='_blank'><strong>Asif says talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ‘over’, ceasefire stands for time being</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan on addressing cross-border terrorism are “over” and have “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides, adding that the ceasefire stands for the time being.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
Earlier, officials and sources said the talks stalled without any agreement. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told reporters, confirming that the third round of discussions — which had began on Thursday in the Turkish capital — had hit an impasse.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”
Asif elaborated that during the earlier rounds, the negotiators urged for another round. “Even after the talks in Istanbul failed, they committed that they would participate in the next round.”
“Our returning empty-handed reinforces a lack of faith in Afghanistan. The situation, God forbid if it flares up, if there are attacks on us from their soil, then we will respond depending on the gravity of the situation,” said the defence minister.
Asif clarified that the ceasefire stands for the time being, but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
“If they have put forward any unacceptable demand, then it is a means of escape, since they knew they would be unsuccessful, they can turn around and say that Pakistan denied our demands,” added the minister.
He reiterated that Pakistan has one main demand: the cessation of attacks from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, the Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid held Islamabad responsible for the deadlock in the talks, saying that the Pakistani delegation’s “irresponsible and uncooperative spirit” led to the breakdown.
Atmosphere described as ‘not positive’
Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lieutenant General Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Reports from Istanbul suggested that the Pakistani delegation left for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
DG ISI and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process.
A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
“The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islamabad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive,” suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation.”
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive.”
Information Minister Ata Tarar, who had declared a similar deadlock at the previous round before mediators salvaged a statement, said the “onus lies on Afghanistan to fulfill its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism — in which so far they have failed.”
“Pakistan shall continue to exercise all options necessary to safeguard the security of its people and its sovereignty,” Tarar said, echoing the Foreign Office spokesman’s earlier warning about Islamabad’s response in case of failure of the talks.
“All I can say is that, in any eventuality, we will protect the lives of our people and make sure that our civilians, our military forces, and our law enforcement agencies on the border are not killed by attacks emanating from Afghanistan,” Andrabi said.
Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began yesterday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire.
Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.

North Korea’s missile launch on Friday came just over a week after US President Donald Trump — on a tour of the region — expressed interest in meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Pyongyang did not respond to the offer.
Pyongyang’s defence minister No Kwang Chol said Washington “has become brazen in its military moves to threaten the security” of the North, and that it was “intentionally escalating the political and military tension in the region”.
 
 

“We will show more offensive action against the enemies’ threat,” he said, according to Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Earlier in the week, before Friday’s launch, US Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and his South Korean counterpart visited the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) where they “reaffirmed the strong combined defence posture and close cooperation” between their countries.
On Wednesday, the US nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan for logistics support and crew rest, according to Seoul’s navy — an act North Korea’s No said was “further escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula”.
No also said Hegseth’s DMZ visit was meant to “fan up war hysterics”.
The US Indo-Pacific Command said on Friday that North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch “highlights the destabilising impact” of Pyongyang’s actions, adding that the United States was “consulting closely with our allies and partners”.
South Korea’s military had strongly condemned Pyongyang’s missile launch.
Seoul’s military “urges North Korea to immediately cease all actions that heighten tensions between the two Koreas”, it said in a statement.
Trump last week also announced that he had approved South Korea’s plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.
Developing such a submarine would mark a significant leap in South Korea’s naval and defence industrial base, analysts say, joining a select group of countries with such vessels.
They have said Seoul’s plan to construct an atomic-driven vessel would likely draw an aggressive response from Pyongyang.
South Korean lawmakers, briefed by the defence intelligence agency, said earlier this week that Pyongyang appears ready to promptly carry out what would be its seventh nuclear test, should leader Kim decide to proceed.</p><small>2025-11-08 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08074659829e6ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953781/ecc-clears-circular-debt-plan-paves-way-to-wind-up-power-holding-limited' target='_blank'><strong>ECC clears circular debt plan, paves way to wind up Power Holding Limited</strong></a><br><p>• Okays Rs960bn sovereign guarantee for Rs1.225tr loans from local banks
• Says remittance incentives to be phased out with caution
• Gas allocated to fertiliser sector; LNG cost adjustments cleared for tariffs
ISLAMABAD: The Econo­mic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Fri­day approved an inter-corporate circular debt settlement plan, including tariff rationalisation for all six operational nuclear power plants in line with other power producers, thus also paving the way to wind up Power Holding Ltd (PHL), a shell company created to park old circular debt.
The meeting of the ECC, pre­­sided over by Finance Mi­­nister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved about Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees for Rs1.225 trillion in commercial loans from local banks for circular debt settlement and the diversion of gas for fertiliser plants.
 
 

As finalised by the military-led task force on power sector reforms in line with similar previous renegotiations with private and government-ow­ned power plants earlier this year, the ECC approved a sum­mary of the Power Divi­sion for “rationalisation of tariffs and payment adjustments for nuclear power plants (NPPs), government-owned power plants (GPPs), OGDCL and SNGPL”, a statement said.
The ECC approved the memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and authorised the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division “to execute negotiated settlement agreements based on these MoUs”.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA and the commission to amend the relevant power purchase agreements of four key nuclear power plants, including four at Chashma (C1 to C4) and two at Karachi (K2 and K3), having a total capacity of about 3,500 megawatts.
The federal government would take over some of their financial contractual obligations, for which the ECC also approved a set of facilitation measures. Based on this, the PAEC will file separate tariff petitions for these six plants, in line with the debt adjustments agreed in the negotiated settlement agreements.
In most cases, the government has guaranteed some foreign supplier credits, while in other cases, it has extended cash development loans and charged significantly higher interest rates than the original borrowing cost.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA to pay outstanding liabilities of GPPs from funds available under the circular debt financing facility, worth Rs1.225tr, recently contracted with local banks.
The ECC approved PHL loan repayment of Rs23.6bn and a waiver of Rs119.5bn on late-payment interest receivables from the LNG-based GPPs at Bhikki, Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah. It also approved payment of the rem­aining balance due to OGDCL via the two Uch power plants of over 1,000MW combined.
The ECC also approved policy guidelines to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority un­­der Section 21 of the Ogra Ord­­inance, enabling the inc­or­­poration of Rs22bn appro­ved by the federal cabinet to include LNG cost of supply in the consumer tariff, subject to verification by auditors.
The Ministry of Finance said the decision would enh­ance financial sustainability, strea­mline payments, and redu­­ce overall costs in the power sector.
Circular debt financing
The ECC approved another summary of the Power Divi­sion for the issuance of a government guarantee amounting to Rs659.67bn for circular debt financing of Rs1.225tr. The guarantee is intended for the settlement of Power Holding Limited’s debt and overdue payments to independent power producers.
It authorised the Finance Division to issue a “letter of comfort”, a document that as­­su­­res one party to another ab­­out a potential or existing busi­­ness or financial obligation.
The Power Division was directed to report back to the ECC on the timeframe for PHL’s closure following the settlement of the debt issue.
The meeting also decided in principle to phase out incentive schemes for banks and exchange companies for channelling home remittances, su­­bject to an appropriate timi­ng, given the State Bank of Pakis­tan’s warning that imme­diate action would severely affect healthy inflows.
The ECC also approved a proposal from the Ministry of National Food Security and Re­­­search to reallocate funds within the division. The ap­­p­r­oval allows the transfer of res­ources from the Inter-Provi­n­c­i­­al Coordination Division thr­ou­­gh a technical supplementary grant to support ongoing agricultural research initiatives.
A summary from the Minis­try of Maritime Affairs on utilising Pakistan International Bulk Terminal at Port Qasim for handling and exporting copper-gold and other mineral commodities was deferred, with instructions to resubmit a clearer framework after stakeholder consultation.
The Ministry of Interior was granted Rs960 million to ensure timely disbursements to the transferred staff of the Pak Public Works Department for October 2025 to June 2026.
On a Petroleum Division proposal, the ECC approved allocation of about 220m cubic feet of gas from the Ghazij and Shawal fields, diversion from decommissioned/auctioned older plants, and pricing of Mari field gas to fertiliser units to ensure adequate, affordable fertiliser supplies on a structural basis.

A US official said the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force initiated the plot late last year and that it was disrupted this year.
“The plot was contained and does not pose a current threat,” the US official said.
 
 

The US official did not provide detailed evidence or say how the plot was contained. The Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment.
According to the US official, the alleged plot would have taken place after April 1 last year, when Israel attacked the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, killing several top officers of the Revolutionary Guards.
Israel carried out a much more extensive bombing campaign in Iran this year that killed more than 1,000 people. The United States joined by bombing key nuclear sites. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since winning an election in 2007.

The Punjab Assembly passed a unanimous resolution on Oct 28, with significant support from the PTI-aligned opposition, proposing that the national parliament amend and expand Article 140-A of the Constitution in order to strengthen the constitutional framework for local governments (LGs) in the country.
Although there had been more than one proposal to amend Article 140-A in the past, these came either from civil society, political parties or individual legislators. This is the first time that a provincial assembly made this demand, with its Speaker holding a press conference the next day to lend strong support to the idea of a constitutional amendment to end the near-dysfunctional state and, in some cases, the total absence of elected LGs for long periods of time.
A constitutional amendment bill drafted by the renowned constitutional lawyer Shahid Hamid, at the request of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development And Transparency, was introduced by PTI senator Dr Sania Nishtar in the Senate in July 2023 to strengthen LGs in the country. The bill proposed the expansion of Article 140-A to include such details as elections taking place 60 days prior to the expiry of the LG term and the Sixth Schedule listing 36 subjects to be delegated to the LGs. The bill is pending before the Senate.
The MQM-P also introduced a constitutional amendment bill in the National Assembly in October 2024 to expand Article 140-A. The bill proposed the devolution of 42 subjects to the LGs. It called for a minimum guaranteed percentage of provincial revenue to be allocated to LGs and possibly directly transferred from the federal divisible pool to them. This bill also proposed the holding of LG elections before the expiry of their term.

There is a growing realisation in Pakistan that Article 140-A needs to be expanded.

The demand for a constitutional amendment to strengthen LGs started gaining momentum after almost 70 years of neglect of the LG system — a demand that was reinforced after the passage of the 18th Amendment in 2010 when significant powers were devolved from the federation to the provinces, precisely demarcating the powers between the federation and the provinces.
 
 

But the devolution from the provinces to the LGs was mentioned only in general terms through the insertion of the brief new Article 140-A (of 41 words). The new article provided that “each province shall establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments”, but, unlike in the case of the provincial governments, it gave no specific framework of LGs, such as the minimum powers, financial resources, term and elections. All these details were left to the provinces to decide through the LG laws to be framed by the respective provincial assemblies and, in the case of Islamabad, the parliament.
Although 15 years have passed since the 18th Amendment, LGs in the country remain ineffective and powerless. Usually, ineffective LG laws are framed by the provinces and amended frequently — the Election Commission of Pakistan is unable to keep pace with the changes and thus unable to hold elections.
A case in point is the election for the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation where the last LG existed till 2021. Since then, whenever the ECP completed the demarcation of the LGs and announced the election schedule, the government amended the law changing the number of union councils, thus forcing the ECP to start the process of demarcation afresh. The ECP narrated its tragic tale of failures in a press release issued in May this year where it summed up how it had conducted delimitation of constituencies five times and the election schedule was issued thrice, only to be cancelled later because of last-minute changes in election laws.
There is an inherent conflict of interest between the provincial and local governments.
Provincial governments do not want to let go of their powers and financial resources which have significantly increased since the passage of the 18th Amendment and the seventh NFC award. Generally, about one-third of the annual development funds are supposed to be spent through the LGs. No provincial government is, however, willing to part with these funds. In the absence of effective elected LGs, members of the national and provincial assemblies exercise considerable influence on local development spending and, therefore, are not keen on empowering LGs.
 
 

Neighbouring India faced a similar situation in the initial 42 years after enacting its constitution in 1950. In 1992, the Indian parliament passed two constitutional amendments inserting two full-fledged parts running into approximately 20 pages in the constitution. The 73rd amendment dealt with the panchayats or rural tier of the LGs and the 74th amendment was about the municipalities.
The Statement of Objects and Reasons of these amendment acts reveal considerable similarities between present-day Pakistan and pre-1992 India. The statement says: “In many states local bodies have become weak and ineffective on account of a variety of reasons, including the failure to hold regular elections, prolonged supersessions and inadequate devolution of powers and functions. … Having regard to these inadequacies, it is considered necessary that provisions relating to urban local bodies are incorporated in the Constitution… .”
No wonder there is a strong and growing realisation in Pakistan too that Article 140-A needs to be expanded to outline details, making it impossible for provinces to deny the establishment of effective LGs.
One may make the case that the LGs are a provincial subject and, therefore, expanding Article 140-A may run counter to provincial autonomy. The reality is that no one is suggesting the removal of ‘local governments’ from the provincial legislative list but as the insertion of Article 140-A was not a violation of provincial autonomy in 2010, further expansion of this article providing a basic outline of LGs will not interfere with provincial rights either.

A total of 7,764 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained in the week ending Nov 1, a significant increase from the previous week, the report said.
Of those arrested between Oct 26 and Nov 1, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and undocumented Afghans accounted for 77pc, while Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders represented the remaining 23 pc, it added.
 
 

The report noted that 86pc of the arrests and detentions occurred in Balochistan. Across the country, the top three districts for arrests and detentions between Jan 1 and Nov 1, 2025, were Chagi, Attock and Quetta.

The rate of returns and deportations also rose sharply in the last week of October. According to the UN data, the number of returns increased by 101pc and deportations by 131pc compared to the week of Oct 19-25.
The figures climbed from 18,630 returns, including 3,341 deportations, in the previous week to 37,448 returns, including 7,733 deportations, in the week ending Nov 1.
“This notable increase is primarily attributed to the reopening of the Chaman border, with Torkham also reopening on Nov 1,” the report stated.
From Sept 15, 2023, to Nov 1, 2025, a cumulative total of 1,667,713 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.
For the returns from Oct 26 to Nov 1, the largest group was PoR holders at 47pc, followed by undocumented individuals at 44pc and ACC holders at 8pc. In contrast, deportees during the same period were overwhelmingly undocumented at 93pc.
The report found that fear of arrest was the primary reason for return among 93pc of undocumented individuals and ACC holders, and for 39pc of PoR holders, since April 1, 2023.
The recent activity follows several government directives issued this year impacting Afghan nationals.
In July, the government ordered the repatriation of PoR card holders following the expiration of their card validity on June 30, later
setting a Sept 1 deadline for them to leave Pakistan.

Its purpose was clear yet ambitious: to provide a multilateral forum where nations could collectively agree on measures to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations and prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.
The early years of the COP process reflected a sense of optimism. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) represented the first legally binding framework, committing industrialised countries to emission reductions. However, the absence of major emitters like the United States and the lack of commitments from developing countries weakened its implementation. The Copenhagen Summit (2009) exposed deep fractures between the developed and developing world over responsibility, finance, and fairness and marked a turning point in the politics of climate diplomacy.
This tension between collective ambition and national interest has defined every COP since. Des­pite a shared understanding that no single nat­ion can solve the climate crisis alone, each negotiation cycle has been mired in differing historical responsibilities, domestic economic priorities and conflicting definitions of ‘justice’ and ‘equity’.
At the heart of climate diplomacy lies a paradox that explains why a universally accepted agreement remains elusive in achieving its objective: the countries that are most responsible for climate change are not the ones most vulnerable to its effects. Industrialised nations built their wealth on fossil fuels, while developing countries like Pakistan now bear the brunt of resulting climate impacts of floods, droughts, glacial melt and food insecurity with limited capacity to adapt. Efforts to reach universal consensus are stymied by this historical imbalance. The North-South divide manifests in three recurring areas of contention:
Responsibility and burden-sharing: Developed countries resist strong language on liability and compensation, while developing countries dem­and recognition of loss and damage as a matter of climate justice.

The COP process has evolved or devolved into what many observers now describe as a ‘climate fair’.

Finance: Despite pledges, the promise on climate finance has not been fully delivered, and falls far short of need.
Ambition gap: Many countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions remain insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The gap between pledges and implementation continues to widen. While the COP remains a vital arena for dialogue, its consensus-based decision-making model often leads to lowest-common-denominator outcomes with statements of intent rather than binding commitments.
The Paris Agreement (2015), celebrated as a diplomatic triumph for crafting a flexible, bottom-up framework, marked a shift from imposed obligations to voluntary pledges. Yet, a decade later, the reality is sobering. Global emissions continue to rise, and current trajectories point towards warming of around 2.7°C by the end of the century. Climate disasters from catastrophic floods in Pakistan to record heatwaves across Europe and droughts in the Horn of Africa underline that adaptation is no longer a distant concern but an immediate survival challenge.
Meanwhile, the COP process itself has evolved or devolved into what many observers now describe as a ‘climate fair’. Conference halls are crowded not only with negotiators but also with corporations, NGOs and lobbyists, all vying for visibility. While this diversity of actors fosters innovation and awareness, it has also blurred the focus.
 
 

The spectacle often overshadows substance and announcements frequently outnumber actual deliverables. The risk is that COPs have become a performative rather than transformative stage for declarations, not decisions. Real progress increasingly occurs in smaller coalitions or outside the formal UNFCCC framework, through initiatives such as climate finance partnerships, regional adaptation programmes, and private sector decarbonisation alliances.
For Pakistan, it is time to reframe its approach from normative attendance to strategic influence using COP not just as a diplomatic event but a platform for survival advocacy. To make its participation strategic, Pakistan should consider the following approach:


Adopt a justice-centred narrative framing its stance around climate justice and resilience through equity. Its experience as a climate front-line state gives moral authority to demand parity between adaptation and mitigation in global finance and policy.


Lead on regional solidarity as part of the Third Pole region to champion a South-South cooperation framework focused on shared challenges, glacier melt, river basin management, and food and water security. Regional diplomacy around climate resilience could become a signature pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy.


Champion the loss and damage agenda for capitalisation — simplified access, grant-based finance and inclusion of local communities in rebuilding and adaptation planning.


Invest in science, storytelling, and strategy: negotiations are driven by data and diplomacy. Pakistan should strengthen its climate data infrastructure, empower young negotiators and amplify its stories of resilience, turning lived experiences into global advocacy tools.


Forge strategic partnerships: beyond government-to-government engagement, Pakistan can build alliances with global think tanks, civil society, and climate innovators to position itself as a thought leader on adaptation finance and resilience-building.


 
 

The journey from Kyoto to Paris, and now tow­ards COP30, reveals both progress and paralysis in global climate diplomacy. While the world has learned to talk about climate change with unprecedented urgency, it has yet to act with equal conviction.
For Pakistan, participation in COP must transcend attendance. It should be about shaping narratives, mobilising alliances and asserting leadership among the Global South. By focusing its voice on justice, adaptation, and regional solidarity, Pakistan can not only safeguard its national interests but also contribute meaningfully to a fairer and more resilient global climate order.

• Azerbaijan will only send peacekeepers ‘if fighting stops’
WASHINGTON: President Don­ald Trump said on Thursday that he expects a US-coordinated International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to be on the ground in Gaza “very soon”.
The multinational force — likely to include troops from Mus­lim countries such as Egypt, Qat­ar, Turkiye, etc — is part of Trump’s post-war governance plan for Gaza.
The plan helped lead to a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 10, but the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has not abated.
 
 

“It’s going to be very soon. And Gaza is working out very well,” Trump said at a White House fun­ction with Central Asian leaders.
“You haven’t been hearing too much about problems, and I’ll tell you, we’ve had countries that have volunteered if there’s a problem with Hamas.”
The force is supposed to train and support vetted Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, with backing from Egypt and Jordan.
It also will be tasked with sec­uring border areas and preventing weapons reaching Hamas.
On Wednesday, the United States circulated a draft UN Sec­urity Council resolution to partner nations aimed at shoring up Trump’s plan, including by greenlighting the international force.
Washington’s UN envoy Mike Waltz shared the draft with the 10 elected Security Council members — which includes Pakistan — and several regional partners, a spokesperson for the US mission said in a statement.
A vote has not yet been scheduled. According to diplomatic sources, several countries have indicated their willingness to participate in the force, but insist on a Security Council mandate before actually deploying troops into the Palestinian territory.
Meanwhile, senior Muslim diplomats said the issue is already sensitive, and strong pro-Palestinian sentiment in their countries makes it even more delicate.
They noted that support for the US draft resolution would depend on a clear UN mandate, a non-combat role, and coordination with Palestinian authorities.
“It is a draft that will be negotiated and evolve,” a senior diplomat from a Muslim bloc country told Dawn. “The draft was already circulated — is being considered and discussed by the Council members at this stage.”
Azeri troops
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Azerbaijan does not plan to send peacekeepers to Gaza unless there is a complete halt to fighting there between Israel and Hamas.
“We do not want to put our troops in danger. This can only happen if military action is completely stopped,” the Azerbaijani foreign ministry source said.
The source noted that any such decision would have to be approved by parliament. The head of the parliamentary security committee told Reuters that it had not yet received any draft bill on the matter.

These observations and recommendations emerged during the closing plenary of the 28th Sustainable Development Conference held on Friday, where experts — including representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) — underscored the need for immediate action.
World Bank Country Director Dr Bolormaa Amgabazar said that Pakistan faces alarmingly high vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, compounded by escalating air and water pollution. At the same time, the country’s rapid population growth — among the highest globally — is placing immense strain on its already depleting natural resources, posing serious long-term risks to environmental and economic stability.
 
 

She said that the Climate and Country Development Report by the World Bank predicted a 20-30 per cent decline in GDP by 2050, amid business as usual and no action to address climate vulnerability.

“Pre-arranged and predictable multi-year financing is the key for Pakistan in terms of emergency that should be multi-sectoral financing basically for development,” she added.
Dr Bolormaa mentioned the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework, which is a $20 billion financing for the next 20 years to be available for Pakistan, and the government can decide its future interventions and projects around it.
 






IMF Country Representative Mahir Binici, on the occasion, said that Pakistan’s newly approved $1.4 billion arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) will play a vital role in strengthening the country’s economic resilience and capacity to withstand environmental shocks.
“The initiative is aimed at integrating climate considerations into Pakistan’s public financial management and fostering long-term sustainable growth,” he said, adding that the RSF is operating in parallel with Pakistan’s ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF), a three-year structural reform programme running until 2027.
“Both programmes are Pakistan’s own reform efforts, supported by the Fund,” Binici said, emphasising that the synergy between the two frameworks is “instrumental in placing Pakistan on a path toward stronger, more inclusive and climate-resilient growth.”
Mr Binici said Pakistan is taking concrete steps to embed climate priorities into its budgetary process, starting from the next fiscal year. “Project selection under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) will undergo climate screening, especially for major infrastructure investments,” he added, stressing that such transparency would enhance accountability and resource efficiency.
UNDP Resident Representative Samuel Rizk said the world is witnessing a transformative phase where financing has become more appropriate and critical for ensuring sustainable development.
He noted that the government is the biggest source of financing for sustainable development, chipped in by multilateral development entities and the private sector together.

According to the Ministry of Finance’s fiscal operations report for July-September 2025, the overall budget balance showed a surplus of Rs2.12 trillion in absolute terms, up 10pc from Rs1.896tr in the same period last year. As a share of GDP, the surplus slipped marginally from 1.7pc to 1.6pc.
Last year eventually closed with a 5.4pc deficit, as rising expenditures gradually offset the one-time impact of SBP profits.
 
 

The primary balance — the difference between total revenue and expenditure, excluding interest payments — stood at 2.7pc of GDP this year, slightly lower than last year’s 2.8pc. In absolute terms, however, the primary surplus grew 8.4pc to Rs3.497tr, compared to Rs3.2tr a year earlier.
Behind these headline numbers, the report indicated weak revenue performance and limited expenditure control. Total revenues rose only 6pc to Rs6.2tr from Rs5.83tr, equivalent to 4.8pc of GDP, compared to 5.1pc a year earlier.

Record SBP profits, 30pc jump in petroleum levy, strong provincial balances key contributors

Tax revenues stayed flat at 2.4pc of GDP, while non-tax revenues fell to 2.4pc from 2.7pc last year. Despite this, total tax receipts grew 12pc to Rs3.15tr, compared to Rs2.77tr a year earlier.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs2.884tr, up 11pc from Rs2.563tr last year, but its share of GDP remained steady at 2.2pc.
The four provinces together mobilised Rs270bn in tax revenues, up 21pc from Rs213bn last year. They also more than doubled their combined cash surplus to Rs781bn, compared to Rs360bn a year ago — a 54pc increase.
 
 

Total expenditure in the first quarter rose 3.6pc to Rs4.08tr, from Rs3.93tr last year. As a percentage of GDP, spending edged down to 3.1pc from 3.4pc. The statistical discrepancy widened to Rs262bn from Rs117bn, apparently due to slower or delayed federal transfers to the provinces.
Current expenditure climbed 12.6pc to Rs4.07tr from Rs3.54tr but remained unchanged at 3.1pc of GDP. Within this, markup payments increased 5pc to Rs1.378tr from Rs1.31tr, holding steady at 1.1pc of GDP.
Defence spending rose 8.4pc to Rs447.5bn, up from Rs410bn last year, but declined slightly as a share of GDP — to 0.3pc from 0.4pc.
Of the total federal non-tax revenue of Rs2.984tr, down slightly from Rs2.997tr last year, the bulk — Rs2.43tr — came from SBP profits, compared to Rs2.5tr last year. These were driven by the lagged impact of the record-high 22pc policy rate. Markup and dividend income from state-owned enterprises fell 35pc to about Rs40bn from Rs62bn a year earlier.
The report attributed the 54pc rise in provincial surpluses largely to slower or last-minute fund releases from the centre. Punjab led the way, posting a record Rs442bn surplus in the first quarter — a tenfold increase from Rs40bn last year.
Sindh followed with a surplus of Rs209bn, up 37pc from Rs131bn a year earlier. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s surplus, however, dropped 35pc to Rs77bn from Rs104bn, while Balochistan’s contribution fell over 57pc to Rs54bn, compared to Rs85bn last year.

Addressing the media following the conclusion of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, Bilawal said the moot debated the matter of constitutional courts for two days and the party “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed”.
“In the 27th Amendment, the amendment to (article) 243 must be accepted.”
The party chairperson added that “unfinished agenda items” from the Charter of Democracy were also discussed.

“We will engage with the government and see which other points we can reach a consensus on,” said Bilawal. He added that if a consensus can be reached with the incumbent government on agenda items not fulfilled under the Charter of Democracy, “it would be a welcome step”.
Bilawal further said that they are giving their suggestions to the government on the matter of the transfer of judges as proposed under the 27th Amendment.
“The government’s suggestion is to do away with the consultation (with the president) and leave the decision (transferring judges) with the parliamentary committee.”
He stated that the PPP feels that the better approach would be that the “president initiates the transfer” and if we “want to give the judicial commission the role, then fair enough”. “It is a forum where serious debate can take place and the chief justices and senior judiciary are present.”
Addressing the issue of dual nationality, the PPP chairman said he was “not in a position to vote on this right now”, hinting that the party is divided on the issue.
“In conclusion, there are mainly three points in the constitutional amendment that the PPP is considering supporting, the amendment to (article) 243, constitutional courts in the context of the government having conversations with us about what other aspects of the Charter of Democracy they are willing to implement at this time and the transfer of judges as long as the incoming and outgoing chief justices are members of the commission.”
Fielding questions from reporters, the PPP chairman said that amendments to Article 243 must be accepted.
“The question of forming constitutional courts, along with the other provisions of the Charter of Democracy, will be accepted,” Bilawal said. “With the votes of the incoming and outgoing CJ, along with the judicial commission, if the PML-N agrees with it, then we will accept this, and the PPP will vote on it.”
He also reiterated the PPP’s position on the NFC award, stating that they will oppose any attempt to reduce the shares given to provinces.
“What has come under discussion is the PML-N’s proposal to remove the protection of provincial governments from the NFC. This protects all provinces and the PPP gave its response to it yesterday,” Bilawal stated.
“The Constitution says that the NFC share can only grow, not reduce,” he explained. “The PPP will defend this. Until we are in this parliament, we are not ready to accept that. We are ready to accept other amendments.”
Speaking about local bodies, Bilawal said that the PPP is “paying attention” and noted that the party brought about the protections granted to them by the Constitution.
“If you perform an impartial analysis of the local body legislation in the four provinces … most political, administrative and financial autonomy is in Sindh,” he said. “When the PML-N approached us about the 27th Amendment, they did not discuss local bodies with us, but we want to see local bodies that are strong.”
The party chairman also highlighted legislation passed by the Punjab Assembly that abolished the office of mayor.
“If we did that, what would your reaction be?” he asked reporters.
“Every province has its own context, but the strongest local body system is in Sindh,” he reiterated. “It is always working to do better and we are happy to talk to anyone who sees improvement in our local bodies.”
Earlier today, the PPP appeared divided over the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment but signalled support for changes to Article 243.
Last night, the party indicated conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s CEC at Bilawal House late on Thursday night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
PPP insiders told Dawn that today’s meeting began after Friday prayers and is ongoing. They said that, except for the proposed amendments to Article 243, none of the other proposals have been agreed upon.
They added that the party will support the proposed amendment to the constitutional courts if provinces receive equal representation. Proposals related to the provincial share of the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and federalising education — which was devolved to provinces — were rejected.</p><small>2025-11-08 02:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08074103c59b3e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953833/kp-cms-remarks-about-security-forces-spark-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM’s remarks about security forces spark outrage</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: ‘Dispara­ging’ remarks from Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Muhammad Soh­ail Afridi, regarding ongoing security operations in the province, drew strong condemnation from politicians, religious leaders, and journalists on Friday. 
The offending remarks came during CM Afridi’s interaction with the media outside Adiala jail a day earlier, after he was once again denied an audience with PTI founder Imran Khan. 
During his media talk, he alleged that the sanctity of worship places was violated when sniffer dogs were brought there, while also making disparaging remarks about security personnel.
However, he claimed  that despite everything, they still supported the security forces. 
Reacting to the statement, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned Mr Afridi’s words, while Awami National Party (ANP) chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan  termed it an “attempt to incite religious sentiments”. 
“I condemn any rhetoric that seeks to undermine the honour and sacrifice of our armed forces,” the governor wrote on X. He said the brave sons of soil lay down their lives to protect our province and questioning their intent in sensational terms only damaged morale and public safety.
“The intelligence-based operations have been and will remain necessary to protect our people; these are conducted with the sole aim of safeguarding civilians and restoring peace. Political debate must not cross into actions or words that weaken our security institutions,” he said.
Mr Afridi should exercise restraint and place the safety and unity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa above partisan posturing, he continued. “The security situation of our province demands that all political forces stand with our armed forces in pursuit of lasting peace and stability for our people. Ultimately, it is the people who will deliver accountability in the coming elections.” 
Need for maturity
ANP President Aimal Wali Khan also cautioned Mr Afridi on Friday, reminding him that the position of chief minister required maturity. Mr Khan said taking a collision course by the CM of a province was absolutely not in the interest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
He said that the chief minister’s statement was aimed at inciting religious sentiments and a sane person would not even imagine doing so. His remarks were disrespectful of mosques and would cause further frictions with the state institutions, he noted.
The ANP president said it was CM’s responsibility to reduce differences and misunderstandings instead of increasing them further. He questioned what would be the fate of the province in such a situation. 
He said that Mr Afridi should fight a constitutional battle for his leadership through courts instead of confrontation and pay attention to the affairs of the province.
He said that the establishment should also respect mandate and the CM must get his protocol. However, he added, Mr Afridi, too, should better realise the importance of his position.
‘CM must tender apology’
Meanwhile, Baloch­istan CM Sarfaraz Bugti strongly reacted to the “irresponsible” statement of the KP CM, describing it as “an attempt to strengthen the enemy’s narrative”.
He also reminded his KP counterpart that the security forces restored peace from Balochistan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by sacrificing thousands of lives. He said Mr Afridi should apologise to the nation and the families of the martyrs for his irresponsible statement, as the mockery of security institutions could not be tolerated. 
The chairman of the Pakistan Ulema Council also condemned CM Afridi’s remarks, calling them “misleading”.
“The speech made by KP CM regarding mosques is regrettable,” Maulana Tahir Ashrafi was quoted as saying. “The statement made by the KP CM is also an attempt to tarnish the image of Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi said.

The previously unreported intelligence, described by the former officials as among the most startling shared with top US policymakers during the war, pointed to doubts within the Israeli military about the legality of its tactics that contrasted sharply with Israel’s public stance defending its actions.
Two of the former US officials said the material was not broadly circulated within the government until late in the Biden administration, when it was disseminated more widely ahead of a congressional briefing in December 2024.
The intelligence deepened concerns in Washington over Israel’s conduct in a war it said was necessary to eliminate Hamas fighters embedded in civilian infrastructure. There were concerns Israel was intentionally targeting civilians and humanitarian workers, a potential war crime which Israel has strongly denied.
US officials expressed alarm at the findings, particularly as the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza raised concerns that Israel’s operations might breach international legal standards on acceptable collateral damage.
The former US officials Reuters spoke to did not provide details on what evidence, such as specific wartime incidents, had caused concerns among Israel’s military lawyers.
Israel has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians during a two-year military campaign, say Gaza health officials. Israel’s military has said at least 20,000 of the fatalities were combatants.

Reuters spoke to nine former US officials in then-president Joe Biden’s administration, including six who had direct knowledge of the intelligence and the subsequent debate within the US government. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Reports of internal US government dissent over Israel’s Gaza campaign emerged during Biden’s presidency. This account, based on detailed recollections from those involved, offers a fuller picture of the debate’s intensity in the administration’s final weeks, which ended with President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.
Israeli Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, declined to comment when asked for a response about the US intelligence and the internal Biden administration debate about it.
Neither the Israeli prime minister’s office nor the Israeli military spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment.
Debate intensified in final days of Biden term
The intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council (NSC), where officials and lawyers debated how and whether to respond to the new findings.
A US finding that Israel was committing war crimes would have required, under US law, blocking future arms shipments and ending intelligence sharing with Israel.
Israel’s intelligence services have worked closely with the US for decades and provide critical information, in particular, about events occurring in the Middle East.
Biden administration conversations in December included officials from across the government, including the State Department, the Pentagon, the intelligence community and the White House. Biden was also briefed on the matter by his national security advisers.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We do not comment on intelligence matters,” a State Department spokesperson said in response to emailed questions about Reuters reporting.
The American debate about whether the Israelis had committed war crimes in Gaza ended when lawyers from across the US government determined that it was still legal for the US to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the US had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict, according to three former US officials.
 
 

They reasoned that the intelligence and evidence gathered by the US itself did not prove the Israelis had intentionally killed civilians and humanitarians or blocked aid, a key factor in legal liability.
Some senior Biden administration officials feared that a formal US finding of Israeli war crimes would force Washington to cut off arms and intelligence support — a move they worried could embolden Hamas, delay ceasefire negotiations, and shift the political narrative in favour of the group.
Hamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 251 in its October 7, 2023 attack, with Israel launching its campaign in retaliation.
The decision to stay the course exasperated some of those involved who believed that the Biden administration should have been more forceful in calling out Israel’s alleged abuses and the US role in enabling them, said former US officials.
President Trump and his officials were briefed by Biden’s team on the intelligence but showed little interest in the subject after they took over in January and began siding more powerfully with the Israelis, said the officials.
State Department lawyers repeatedly raised concerns
Even before the US gathered war crimes intelligence from within the Israeli military, some lawyers at the State Department, which oversees legal assessments of foreign military conduct, repeatedly raised concerns with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes, according to five former US officials.
As early as December 2023, lawyers from the State Department’s legal bureau told Blinken in meetings that they believed Israel’s military conduct in Gaza likely amounted to violations of international humanitarian law and potentially war crimes, two of the US officials said.
But they never made a conclusive assessment that Israel was violating international humanitarian law, a move that other US officials at the State Department saw as the legal bureau pulling its punches.
“They saw their job as being justifying a political decision,” one of the former US officials said. “Even when the evidence clearly pointed to war crimes, the Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card was proving intent,” one of the officials said.

The lack of a definitive conclusion by the State Department’s lawyers was largely reflected in a US government report produced during the Biden administration in May 2024, when Washington said Tel Aviv might have violated international humanitarian law using US-supplied weapons during its military operation in Gaza.
The report, which was prepared by the State Department, stopped short of a definitive assessment, citing the fog of war.
“What I can say is that the Biden administration constantly reviewed Israel’s adherence to the laws of armed conflict, as well as the requirements of our own laws,” Blinken said through a spokesperson for this story. Blinken declined to comment on the intelligence matters.
International concerns about possible war crimes
Last November, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, as well as Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.
Hamas has since confirmed Israel killed Deif.
Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
Among the issues debated by US officials in the final weeks of the Biden administration was whether the government would be complicit if Israeli officials were to face charges in an international tribunal, said people familiar with this debate.
US officials publicly defended Israel but also privately debated the issue in light of
intelligence reports, and they became a point of political vulnerability for Democrats. Biden and later Vice President Kamala Harris waged ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaigns.
Biden did not respond to a request for comment.
Israel, which is fighting a genocide case at the International Court of Justice, rejects genocide allegations as politically motivated and says that its military campaign targets Hamas, not Gaza’s civilian population.
The Israeli military says it seeks to minimise civilian harm while targeting militants embedded in hospitals, schools and shelters, using warnings and appropriate munitions.
An Israeli military official told Reuters in September that the military was investigating about 2,000 incidents of possible misconduct, including civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure.
Some cases came to light through the genocide case filed at the International Court of Justice, the official said.</p><small>2025-11-07 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/07225825d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953726/12-suspected-dacoits-killed-during-police-search-operation-in-sindhs-ghotki' target='_blank'><strong>12 suspected dacoits killed during police search operation in Sindh’s Ghotki</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Police on Friday eliminated 12 “wanted criminals” during an ongoing search operation against dacoits in Ghotki, including those who had bounties placed on them by the Sindh government, according to a statement.
For decades, dozens of dacoit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and robbing people on highways have become a daily reality.
The Sindh Home Department’s statement said that the operation was carried out under the supervision of Sukkur Deputy Inspector General Faisal Abdullah Chachar, with Ghotki Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran, Sukkur SSP Azhar Mughal, Obaro Deputy Superintendent of Police Abdul Qadir Soomro, and their teams actively participating.
“Twelve extremely dangerous criminals were killed, some of whom had bounties placed on them by the Sindh government,” the Sukkur DIG said. “A reward of Rs5 million was placed on the dacoit Shah Nawaz alias Shahu.”
The DIG added that police took custody of the bodies of seven dacoits, while five bodies were taken by their accomplices under the cover of darkness.
“The slain criminals were members of the Shar gang,” he said. “Around ten armed dacoits were also seriously injured during the encounter, and their accomplices managed to flee with them.”
DIG Chachar added that the dacoits were forced to retreat due to the strong and effective response by the police, and the search operation is still ongoing in the area.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar reaffirmed the government’s resolve that the Sindh Police will not rest until all criminal elements are completely eliminated, the statement added.
“Lanjar lauded the outstanding performance of Sukkur DIG, Ghotki SSP, Sukkur SSP, and their teams for conducting a successful operation against dacoits in Ghotki.”
“Your courageous actions and the operation have brought the police a truly successful outcome,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. “The elimination of dacoits, who were considered symbols of danger and fear among the public, has boosted the police morale.”
He further said that the Ghotki Police deserve appreciation for their effective control over law and order and commendable performance against crime, according to the statement.
Last month, at least 72 riverine dacoits surrendered to the authorities as part of the provincial government’s ‘Sindh Surrender Policy’, a press release issued by the Sindh Home Ministry said.
“Around 72 dacoits surrendered under the Sindh Surrender Policy, and laid down more than 200 small-scale and heavy ammunition,” the press release read.
The weapons included 62 G3 rifles, 97 submachine guns, 48 double-barreled guns, two RPG-7s, an anti-tank recoilless rifle and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun.</p><small>2025-11-07 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/072211531d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953724/govt-will-proceed-with-parts-of-27th-amendment-that-have-consensus-says-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Govt will proceed with parts of 27th Amendment that have consensus, says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that the government will proceed only with those parts of the 27th Constitutional Amendment agreed upon by coalition partners, while disputed matters, including changes to the 18th Amendment and the NFC Award, will remain under discussion.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, Sanaullah said the amendment’s draft was expected to be presented before the cabinet today, but was delayed as the PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) had not yet finalised its position.
“We thought it better to wait for their opinion before moving forward. Once their input comes, we’ll finalise the draft and take it to the cabinet for approval before presenting it in the Senate,” he said.
Responding to a question about PML-N’s agreement with PPP on the formation of a constitutional court, Sanaullah highlighted that the PPP has been committed to the idea since 2005, and both parties are signatories to the Charter of Democracy.
“Their only demand was equal provincial representation,” the PM’s aide said, adding that PML-N agreed with that.
When asked about PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s concerns regarding proposed amendments to the subjects of education and population under the 18th Amendment, as well as the government’s stance on revising the NFC formula, Sanaullah said the imbalance between federal and provincial resources was a “reality that must be addressed through mutual understanding”.
He added there were different points of view on other aspects of the proposed 27th Amendment, including matters related to local governments, overseas Pakistanis’ voting rights, the Election Commission, and the issue of transfer of judges, which will be decided upon based on consensus.
“If there is no consensus, discussions will continue in the future,” Sanaullah said.
‘No roadblocks to amendment’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Amendment, according to a Dawn.com report.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s (Thursday’s) meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
‘Govt lacks mandate’
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the current parliament lacks the mandate and moral authority to amend the Constitution, arguing that such changes require a “genuine two-thirds majority”.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he warned the proposed 27th Amendment would harm both the federation and the provinces, noting that the 18th Amendment had faced no provincial objections. He also pointed out that the fate of the 26th Amendment remains pending before the Supreme Court.
Mr Khan said an independent judiciary is essential to democracy and parliamentary sanctity and made clear the PTI would not support the government on the latest amendment.
Referring to the process adopted for the 26th Amendment, he said a committee had been formed, but “no draft ever surfaced”, adding that the PTI has resigned from that body.
He said the release of the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan would come “under the law, not through any deal”, and that no protest call had been given for November.
“We are working within the law for his release, and he is satisfied with the ongoing efforts,” Barrister Gohar said, dismissing rumours of foreign involvement.</p><small>2025-11-07 18:30</small></div><hr>
