The development comes over a week after the PTI formally requested the appointment of Achakzai — whose party is also part of opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ain-e-Pakistan (TTAP) along with five other parties, including the PTI  — as leader of the opposition in the NA.
The position of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan on August 5.
According to a statement posted on JUI-F’s X account today, a PTI delegation visited Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s residence in Islamabad, “where the JUI-F agreed to support the nomination of Mehmood Khan Achakzai”.
 






The PTI delegation included Asad Qaiser, PTI Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) President Junaid Akbar and  Shahram Khan Tarakai, while JUI-F chief Fazl was accompanied by Maulana Salahuddin Ayubi, Advocate Jalaluddin, and his son, Maulana Asjad Mehmood.
During the meeting, “the PTI delegation appealed to the JUI-F chief to play a role in uniting the opposition in parliament,” the statement said, adding that the PTI also asked the JUI-F to “cooperate” with it regarding a vacant Senate seat from KP.
The two sides also discussed the current political and regional situation, it further stated.
According to the statement, the PTI also “consulted the JUI-F chief on the proposal to hold a national jirga over the law and order situation in KP”.
For his part, Fazl welcomed the proposal, the statement said.
A subsequent post on the TTAP’s X account said Qaiser “briefed Achakzai in detail about his meeting with Fazl and took him into confidence”.
 






The post also stated it was decided during the meeting that the TTAP would hold public gatherings in across the country in November.
Earlier this week, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja had said that the PTI did not see a possibility of the JUI-F supporting it for the NA opposition leader slot.
In response to a question regarding chatter of a new NA opposition leader and whether the JUI-F would support the PTI, Raja had said, “Cons­idering the past, I don’t think they will go with us at the end, and whether they form an alliance with the PPP or the PML-N, I cannot say anything about it, but we (PTI) don’t really have any interest in it.”
The same day, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had met with Fazl, where the two discussed the formulation of a joint strategy on key national issues.</p><small>2025-10-29 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291539146ff19a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951967/pakistan-calls-for-cessation-of-gaza-ceasefire-violations-after-israeli-strikes-kill-over-100' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations after Israeli strikes kill over 100</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday called for the immediate cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations by Israel after the latter’s strike on the Palestinian enclave killed more than 100 people.
Gaza’s health ministry said at least 104 people were killed after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory yesterday, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing a soldier, which the group denied.
The renewed Israeli bombardment prompted strong condemnation from Pakistan, one of the eight Muslim countries that worked with the United States on President Donald Trump’s peace plan.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, which have reportedly resulted in civilian casualties,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
 
 

“These actions constitute a clear and flagrant violation of international law, as well as a breach of the recently concluded peace agreement,” the FO said, warning that such “aggressive measures by the Israeli occupation forces threaten to undermine the international efforts aimed at establishing durable peace and stability in the region”.
“Pakistan calls upon the international community to ensure an immediate cessation of ceasefire violations by the Israeli occupation forces,” it added.
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s principled position for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine based on the pre-June 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital.
 






“At least 101 fatalities were brought to hospitals, including 35 children and a number of women and elderly, as a result of Israeli air strikes in less than 12 hours,” said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency.
“The Israeli strikes targeted tents for displaced people, homes and the vicinity of a hospital in the Strip,” Bassal told AFP. The agency’s toll was confirmed by an AFP tally of reports from medical officials at five Gaza hospitals that received the dead and wounded.
The territory’s main Al-Shifa hospital said one of the strikes hit its backyard.
Al-Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp.
“We had just started to breathe again, trying to rebuild our lives, when the bombardment came back,” said Khadija al-Husni, who lives in a tent at a school in the Al-Shati refugee camp.
“It’s a crime. Either there is a truce or a war — it can’t be both. The children couldn’t sleep; they thought the war was over.”
 


Gaza civil defence agency’s Bassal called the strikes “a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
However, Trump insisted that “nothing“ would jeopardise the truce he helped broker.
During a trip to Asia, the US president defended the actions of its longtime ally Israel, saying, “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back.”
The Israeli military said today it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire, claiming that “dozens of terror targets and terrorists were struck”.
It said its military forces and the Israel Security Agency, also known as Shin Bet, “struck 30 terrorists holding command positions” within fighter groups operating in Gaza.
Israel warns Hamas leadership will have no immunity
Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas leaders today that they would have no immunity after a wave of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, which Tel Aviv said was carried out in response to an attack on its troops.
“There will be no immunity for anyone in the leadership of the terrorist organisation Hamas — neither for those in suits nor for those hiding in tunnels,” Katz said, referring to several Hamas political leaders residing in Doha.
“Whoever raises a hand against an [Israeli] soldier, his hand will be severed. The [Israeli military] has been instructed to act decisively against every Hamas target and will continue to do so.”
 
 

Qatar has played a key mediating role in indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the outbreak of the war in October 2023, and is among the guarantors of the fragile peace deal, along with the US, Egypt, and Turkiye.
On September 9, Israel targeted Hamas negotiators in Doha, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack triggered widespread condemnation and drew a rebuke from Trump as well.
Weeks later, Israel and Hamas accepted a 20-point peace plan presented by Trump that called for the release of Gaza hostages and Palestinian prisoners, as well as a ceasefire after two years of deadly conflict.
Subsequently, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will head to Turkiye next week to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the Gaza peace plan to discuss the next steps.
Officials have said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force being assembled for Gaza. The reported chances of Islamabad doing so have raised questions among Pakistani politicians and journalists.</p><small>2025-10-29 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2914465421d6277.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951968/lahore-continues-to-top-global-charts-for-poor-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore continues to top global charts for poor air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore continues to rank as the most polluted city in the world in terms of its air quality, the global monitor IQAir said on Wednesday.
A day ago, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reached a severe peak of 422 but dropped to 341 today — still categorised as “hazardous” — keeping it at the top of the list of cities with the poorest air quality.
Behind the Punjab capital in the rankings were New Delhi with an AQI score of 232, Beijing at 222, Kinshasa and Kathmandu at 155 each, and Karachi at 140.
 


The Punjab government has taken notice of the situation and raised a high alert, including revising school timings across the province to begin at 8:35am.
In response to the crisis, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has also launched a large-scale anti-smog operation, deploying 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers, and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling.
Meanwhile, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, praised the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in handling the anti-smog operations, calling her hard work “a testament to the success of the vision of improving the environment”.
“In the coming years, Punjab will see improvements like Beijing,” she said.
She added that the improvements and measures taken to reduce smog had played a role in changing the mindset of farmers.
According to a report by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), this year’s environmental violations score was 294.
“Action is underway against plants causing air pollution,” the minister said.</p><small>2025-10-29 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291408597426db1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951964/health-minister-saudi-counterpart-discuss-efforts-to-eradicate-polio' target='_blank'><strong>Health minister, Saudi counterpart discuss efforts to eradicate polio</strong></a><br><p>Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal and his Saudi counterpart Fahad Al-Jalajel held a discussion in Riyadh related to polio eradication from Pakistan, along with talks related to cooperation in the health sector and promotion of investment, the health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The meeting took place a day ago on the sidelines of the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh, where Kamal was part of a Pakistani delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Islamabad and Riyadh share long-standing diplomatic ties and, in recent years, have sought to expand and strengthen their partnership by adding greater strategic depth through enhanced cooperation in defence, economy, and health.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
“Both ministers held detailed discussions regarding polio eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” said the health ministry’s spokesperson, Sajjad Shah. “The upcoming polio eradication campaign was also discussed in the meeting.”
 






“Eliminating polio is one of the top priorities of the Government of Pakistan,” Kamal was quoted as saying by the spokesperson. “Under the leadership of the prime minister of Pakistan, steps are being taken to eradicate polio with complete unity.”
According to Kamal, the “historical and brotherly relations” between the two countries are built on strong foundations.
The health minister highlighted that so far, four national polio eradication campaigns have been successfully conducted during the year 2025, adding that the campaigns have ensured access to the vaccine for 45 million children.
“As a result of high-quality polio campaigns, cases have decreased significantly,” Kamal said. He, however, stressed that despite progress in the fight against polio, “the mission is not yet complete,” he added.
The Saudi delegation appreciated the steps taken by Pakistan to combat polio, per the ministry’s spokesperson. The delegation also assured of continued cooperation in combating polio in the future.
This year, at least 30 cases of the poliovirus have been reported across the country so far. In 2024, Pakistan reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-10-29 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29133143bdfbd37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951963/unruffled-by-trump-chinese-parents-chase-american-dream-for-kids' target='_blank'><strong>Unruffled by Trump, Chinese parents chase ‘American dream’ for kids</strong></a><br><p>Despite plummeting relations between Beijing and Washington, Shanghai resident Huang is determined that her daughter will complete her costly education in the United States.
Even as the two sides have spent much of this year locked in a blistering trade row, US schools and universities remain hugely popular with parents who are chasing what they see as better opportunities and an international outlook for their children.
They will be among many hoping that an expected meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday — their first encounter since the former’s return to the White House — could pave the way to stabilising ties.
“Even though there’s a lot of drama going on right now… this is just temporary,” Huang told AFP. “This is something I firmly believe in.”
Her 17-year-old daughter has been enrolled in high school in the United States for three years and is hoping to study computer science at a university there.
Trump’s mercurial nature and his “America First” policies have spooked some of Huang’s friends, who are considering sending their children to Europe or Australia instead.

But for Huang, the benefits of a US education far outweigh the cons.
“We feel that the United States is a country that can provide our child with more opportunities, and education is definitely more diverse,” said Huang, who did not give her full name due to privacy concerns.
There is a hefty price tag, though, with Huang estimating she currently pays more than $100,000 a year in education and living expenses.
Wealthiest parents ‘not worried’
Young Chinese people have long been crucial to US universities’ balance sheets.
After Indians, they made up the second-largest nationality of international students for the 2023-24 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education.

But Trump has introduced policies aimed both at curbing immigration and weakening universities, which he sees as a power base of the left.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in May that Washington would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students”.
 
 

However, just a few months later, Trump said the country was going to allow 600,000 Chinese students to “come in”.
The uncertainty doesn’t seem to have put off many Chinese parents, according to Godot Han, who works for a Beijing tutoring agency.
Her wealthiest clients, especially, “have not been worried”.
They “won’t just read a single news article and then suddenly make changes” to long-held plans, she said.
Teachers at her school, part of a thriving domestic industry, prepare some 200 Chinese students yearly for the tests needed for US university admission.
A one-on-one session ranges from $112 to $210 an hour, with some students attending several a day.
 
 

Some parents worry for their children’s safety because of school shootings in the United States and the policies of the Trump administration.
But many have just always “had that kind of American dream”, Han told AFP.
Never a ‘honeymoon period’
The enduring appeal of a US education rests on its “perceived quality and historical reputation”, said Dylan Loh from Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.
“This reputation and prestige are longstanding and despite the obvious difficulties, still remain and will remain for a long time,” he said.
Another parent, Ping Jiaqi, told AFP that US universities could help foster “independent thinking” in his 17-year-old daughter, who is studying at an international high school in China’s eastern Zhejiang province.
 
 

She attended summer school at Brown University last year and visited several other campuses in the United States, hoping to move there for university.
Her father expects her entire tertiary education will cost more than $400,000.
Ping, who runs an education consultancy for Chinese students hoping to study abroad, said daily life for his US-based friends and students “hasn’t been affected much” by Trump.
“When I think about it, US-China relations haven’t really been good at any point over the past decade,” he said.
“There was never really a honeymoon period.“</p><small>2025-10-29 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291258198858603.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951961/great-guys-trump-again-has-words-of-praise-for-pm-shehbaz-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Great guys’: Trump again has words of praise for PM Shehbaz, COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May.
Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both India and Pakistan, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year.
“I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
 
 

“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too.
“And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said.
The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.”
He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.
“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’.
“And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.”
Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”.
 


“But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing?
“You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.”
He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.”
The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs, saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said.
Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-10-29 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291256391e8b2f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951954/supreme-court-tells-phc-to-decide-shibli-farazs-appeal-against-disqualification-as-senator' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court tells PHC to decide Shibli Faraz’s appeal against disqualification as senator</strong></a><br><p>A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to decide PTI leader Shibli Faraz’s appeal against his disqualification as a senator.
Faraz, along with former National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub, first approached the PHC. However, it had decided to adjourn sine die (for indefinite period) the pleas, directing the petitioners to first surrender before the competent court. Later, the PTI leaders challenged the high court’s decision before the SC.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a five-member CB resumed proceedings on Shibli’s appeal, after Ayub had withdrawn his during the last hearing on Monday. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad.
Faraz’s appeal challenges the PHC’s decision to indefinitely adjourn its hearings on his petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification de-seating him as the Senate opposition leader.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Faraz, while Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AAG) Aamir Rehman represented the state.
“We were removed by the election commission with great disgrace,” Gohar contended as the hearing began. He requested that a stay order be issued on the ECP notification removing his client as a member of the upper house of Parliament, thereby halting the by-election on the vacant seat.
 
 

Responding to Justice Rizvi’s question, Gohar replied that a by-election on just one Senate seat was to be held tomorrow. Justice Rizvi also wondered why Faraz was seeking a stay order on the by-election when the PTI had also nominated candidates.
Subsequently, the bench dismissed Gohar’s request, stating that it would not interfere in the by-election process.
A by-election to fill the general seat of the Senate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan and Irfan Saleem are contesting against PPP’s Nisar Khan and independent candidates Taj Mohammad Afridi and Abid Khan Yousafzai.
During the hearing, the ECP lawyer contended that convicts needed to surrender before a court prior to seeking any relief. Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case.
“We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case.
Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law.
At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?”
The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”.
Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.”
Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.”
After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition.
Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal.
PHC denies relief
On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution.
On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests.
The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them.
However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats.
 
 

The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications.
Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role.
Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.</p><small>2025-10-29 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2913011404c241d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951957/test-our-resolve-and-capabilities-at-your-own-peril-asif-tells-kabul-after-talks-fail-in-istanbul' target='_blank'><strong>Test our resolve and capabilities at your own peril, Asif tells Kabul after talks fail in Istanbul</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them that if they wished to test Islamabad’s resolve, they should do so “at your own peril and doom”.
The remarks came hours after a pre-dawn announcement by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar about the collapse of latest round of talks between the two countries in the Turkish capital that were aimed at addressing cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil.
“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X.
 






The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”.
“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.”
 
 

Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”.
“Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said.
In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country.
 
 

“As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented.
He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”.
“If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!”
UN expresses concern over talk failure
In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”.
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN.
“Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported.
From border skirmishes to talk failure
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.
Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”.

Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025, Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025.
During today’s hearing, too, both Gandapur and his lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, failed to appear in court.
Subsequently, Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti upheld the court’s previous order and directed the relevant authorities to arrest and present Gandapur in the court.
The court adjourned the hearing till November 11.
Arms and liquor case
The case dates back to Oct 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on Nov 2.
Gandapur had denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the federal capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
During a previous hearing, Gandapur, while speaking to the media outside the courtroom, had dismissed the case as “politically motivated.”
“There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he had claimed.</p><small>2025-10-29 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29121050bea4e0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina warns of mass voter boycott as her party barred from election</strong></a><br><p>Millions of supporters of Bangladesh’s Awami League will boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls, ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters on Wednesday from her exile in New Delhi.
Hasina, 78, said she would not return to Bangladesh under any government formed after elections that exclude her party, and plans to remain in India, where she fled in August 2024 following a deadly student-led uprising.
An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February.
“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters.
“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.”
Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest
Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote.
The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders.
“We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.”
She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls.
 
 

Separately, in comments to AFP, Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country.
Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile.
The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.
According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.
Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13.
 
 

Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes.
“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.”
While, in written responses to AFP, Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke”
No plans to return home yet
Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it.
Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked.
“It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“
Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history.
A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her.
“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said.
Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform.
‘Open fire on crowds’
Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC.
“The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP, although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”.
“But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.”
The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters.
Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”.
She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “Operation Devil Hunt”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country.
 
 

At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule.
Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”.
This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement.
As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”</p><small>2025-10-29 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/291010083deda55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951950/trump-says-nothing-will-jeopardise-gaza-ceasefire-after-israeli-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says ‘nothing’ will jeopardise Gaza ceasefire after Israeli strikes</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory accusing Hamas of violating the truce, which the group denied.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 50 people, including 22 children, and wounded around 200.
“At least 50 killed, including 22 children and a number of women and children, as a result of the ongoing Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last night,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency, told AFP.
Around 200 people were wounded “in a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”, he said, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic and terrifying”.
Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce.
“They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia.
US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”.
“We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …
but I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said.

Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “powerful strikes” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave.
While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire.
The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza.
Escalations
Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard.
Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp.
Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”.
 


A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement.
Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins.
Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over.
‘Act decisively’
Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.
Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10.
But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office.
Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains.
“Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …
inside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages.
‘We want to rest’
On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again.
“Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said.
“We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable.
“The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP.
The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal.

Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry.

Led by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the ‘Glaciers to Farms’ programme covers nine ADB developing member countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, which all rely on glacier and snow-fed rivers for agriculture, domestic water, and electricity generation.
The programme will focus on four glacier-fed river basins — the Naryn and Pyanj in Central Asia, the Kura in the South Caucasus, and the Swat in Pakistan — covering roughly 27m hectares, the ADB said in a press release.
The handout added that the GCF approved its concessional funding for the programme at its 43rd board meeting on October 29.
It said that around 13m people, including farmers and vulnerable populations in fragile mountain regions, would benefit directly from the programme, adding that it would support climate and glacier assessments that would inform national development plans and investment pipelines.
The programme will also strengthen monitoring and early warning systems to help communities manage the impacts of hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and prolonged droughts, the handout said.
It stated that accelerated glacial melt threatened ecosystem services and livelihoods, presenting a serious challenge in the aforementioned countries, where about one in four jobs are in agriculture.
GCF’s funding will be provided mostly as grants and invested alongside $3.25 billion from ADB over the next decade in a series of projects identified by the countries covered by the programme, it added.
By investing in efficient irrigation, water storage, and watershed management, the projects will help improve agricultural productivity even as accelerated glacial melt increases the frequency of droughts or floods, the handout said.
“Rapid glacial retreat is one of the most complex development challenges faced by our region,” ADB Director for Agriculture, Food, Nature, and Rural Development Yasmin Siddiqi was quoted as saying in the press release.
“We need practical, scalable, and science-based solutions to help communities adapt. With catalytic support from GCF, ‘Glaciers to Farms’ will help move the region beyond fragmented projects and towards systemic, long-term resilience that protects lives and livelihoods now and for future generations,“ she added.
GCF Director of Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Middle East Region Department Thomas Eriksson said that the programme was the “kind of large-scale, innovative, and collaborative effort that will help countries in Central and West Asia strengthen adaptation planning and cooperation to manage climate impacts on glacier-fed water systems”.
“This programme sets a transformative benchmark by improving data, coordination, and financing readiness for long-term resilience in the region’s water and food systems,“ he said.</p><small>2025-10-29 06:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29110837dd73215.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951953/china-india-had-active-communication-over-border-control' target='_blank'><strong>China, India had ‘active’ communication over border control</strong></a><br><p>The Chinese and Indian militaries have had talks on the management of the border the countries share, and both agreed to use existing mechanisms to resolve any “ground issues”, the neighbours said on Wednesday.
New Delhi and Beijing had reached a milestone pact last year on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed.
Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows.
China’s defence ministry said that in the latest round of high-level military talks held on the Indian side of a meeting point on Saturday, the neighbours agreed to continue their dialogue through military and diplomatic channels.
“Both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc.

After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital.
In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said.
“Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said.
The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan.
“In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said.
He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”.
He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue.
“Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists.
“Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said.
“The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said.
The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”.
“The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said.
The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedalled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul.
“Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he said.
“I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedalled from the deal.”
“I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added.
The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Pakistan.
“India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”
When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.
“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists.”
“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.
Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks
On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”.
A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”.
From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”.
However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement.
“The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening.
Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.”
The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost was cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said.
Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue.
Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”</p><small>2025-10-29 05:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2822071532179ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951801/modi-skipped-asean-summit-to-avoid-talk-of-pakistan-with-us-president-trump-report' target='_blank'><strong>Modi skipped Asean summit to avoid talk of Pakistan with US President Trump: report</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump.
The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
“Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said.
“Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit.
It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said.
“Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.”
 
 

Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still.
Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May.
Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-29 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/690182b4d5c11.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951915/gunboat-hypocrisy' target='_blank'><strong>Gunboat hypocrisy</strong></a><br><p>EVEN as Donald Trump crisscrosses the globe, bringing his purported peacemaking skills to parts he didn’t even know were at war, his administration has openly been preparing for militarised regime change in Venezuela. There is nothing new about America’s designs on its ‘backyard’. Latin America’s 20th-century history is replete with instances of unwarranted US interventions and attempted regime change operations. Those in living memory stretch from 1954’s Guatemala coup to the Bay of Pigs in 1961, the 1973 Pinochet putsch in Chile and the invasion of Panama in 1989.
The last of these has frequently been referenced as the most likely model for tackling Venezuela, after Trump authorised CIA ground operations. For the past couple of months, US forces have been targeting boats in the Caribbean, designating them as drug-smuggling vessels. No evidence has been offered.
Latin America has long served as a key supplier of the seeming urge among Americans to blot out reality, but Venezuela has never been a major culprit in the drug trade. By almost every account, it has little or no role in the stateside fascination with fentanyl. Designating Nicolás Maduro as the head of a non-existent cartel comes across as a hollow excuse for regime change, but it helps to disguise the ideological motivation behind the endeavour.
Trump’s concern with drugs may be genuine — who knows? — but the basic demand/ supply formula appears to have escaped his attention. No drug lords in Latin America or elsewhere would bother establishing supply chains to the US in the absence of constant demand. The opioid crisis in the home of the brave and the land of the free is primarily a symptom of societal dysfunction. Disrupting one or two supply trails can only make a temporary difference.

Peacemaker Trump doubles as warmonger.

But the belligerence against Venezuela has little to do with drugs. Back in the first Trump term, his short-lived NSA John Bolton was keen to invade Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Back then, Trump demurred. Even in his second term, he was not impressed by Marco Rubio’s arguments about human rights violations or electoral malpractices. Hence Rubio — the offspring of unhinged anti-Castroites, and the first person since Henry Kissinger to concurrently serve as NSA and secretary of state — leapt upon the drug trade as an excuse, and Trump was suddenly convinced. He called off negotiations in which Maduro had allegedly expressed a willingness to share Venezuela’s substantial mineral wealth with the US and to effectively end trade ties with China and Cuba.
Maduro has served for the past dozen years as an often disappointing and occasionally disturbing successor to Hugo Chávez, whose socialist vision stretched far beyond Venezuela. His endeavour to lift the poorest Venezuelans out of poverty was supported by Cuba, and Fidel Castro was instrumental in reversing the US-backed neoliberal coup that briefly toppled Chávez in 2002.
Chávez won several internationally authenticated elections until his death in 2013, but his chosen successor has strayed from the Bolivarian impulse in ways that many supporters of Chavismo see as a betrayal. For some of them, the manipulation of the 2024 poll was the last straw. Allegations about his desperation to win Trump’s favour only add to the charge sheet, although it’s quite possible that his standing will improve in the face of naked US hostility.
That hostility has lately extended to Colombia, whose president, Gustavo Petro, has been among the most vociferous supporters of Palestinian rights. His US visa was revoked after his no-holds-barred speech to the UN General Assembly last month, and san­ctions have been invoked after he responded angrily to the extrajudicial execution by Ame­r­ica of more than 40 people in the Caribbean.
Trump’s actions and intentions have been questioned by both a bunch of Democrats and a handful of Republicans, the latter mostly concerned about the threats to isolationism implied by the America First impulse. After all, an invasion of Venezuela would suggest a continuity with the neocon tendencies that the MAGA crowd despises. Trump might relent if someone whispers into his ear the obvious fact that blatant warmongering in the Caribbean will diminish his chances of obtaining the Nobel Peace Prize he desperately covets — apart from doing little or nothing to disrupt the flow of fentanyl into the US. But he’s notoriously capricious, and might see an advantage in adding to the US treasure chest of South American scalps.
Trump has yet again betrayed his ignorance of even recent history in describing Colombia’s Petro as “the worst president they have ever had — a lunatic with serious mental problems”. His obscene language is par for the course, but perhaps he should take a good look in the mirror before hurling accusations that fit his own image.

The CM issued these directions to police while presiding over a meeting on law and order here on Tuesday.
The police were directed to submit a report on houses, shops, factories, hotels, petrol pumps or any other property rented to the Afghans or any other foreign national.
 






The CM directed the relevant authorities to make announcements in mosques across Punjab, asking the public to help identify illegal Afghan nationals residing in the province.

She also directed that patwaris, lumberdars and the station house officers (SHOs) should be tasked to file reports in this regard.
Moreover, she ordered a comprehensive field survey across all districts in the province to collect updated data on illegal foreigners.
The meeting also approved legal action against the Afghans or other foreigners who entered Pakistan on visit visas or illegally and were engaged in economic activities here without any authorisation.
The government sought a report from the relevant stakeholders on ‘benami’ (anonymous) and suspicious properties, making it clear that any person found renting or leasing such property to the Afghans or other illegal foreigners, would face stern action.
The CM was told that five FIRs had already been registered in Khanewal against individuals who rented properties to the illegal Afghan residents.
The meeting was apprised that facial recognition technology was being used to identify the Afghan nationals living illegally in the province, besides establishing 45 ‘Holding Centres’ to provide them accommodation, meals and transport facilities to reach the Torkham border.
The meeting was also informed that a crackdown on illegal weapons was underway in the province, and the crime control department (CCD) was taking action in this regard.
It was told hat social media activists promoting extremist groups had also come under strict legal scrutiny, while religious seminaries across Punjab were being de-sealed after necessary verification.
The CM directed that during the action against illegal foreigners and those renting out their properties to them no innocent person should be wrongfully targeted or apprehended.
Meanwhile, on the CM’s directions, the Lahore highway division expedited the patchwork and maintenance of all major roads in Raiwind and surrounding areas, leading to the ‘Tablighi Markaz’ in order to facilitate the people in attending the annual Tablighi Ijtima in Raiwind.
The completion of 13 infrastructure projects in Raiwind area has improved accessibility of thousands of participants attending the Tablighi gathering, the CM was told.
“Development works across Manga Mandi, Lake City, Sue Asal, Jia Bagga, Sundar, Mian Ji Abdullah Road, Pajian Bypass and Railway Road have been completed in a record time, ensuring convenience, safety and a better travel experience for all visitors,” she was told.

In its biennial Perception and Investment Survey 2025, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) — a business group of more than 200 leading foreign investors — said 73pc of its members recommend Pakistan as a viable destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), a notable rise from 61pc in 2023.
The survey released on Tuesday noted this shift as a reflection of improved macroeconomic stability, reduced inflation — down from 37pc in mid-2023 to 4pc by July 2025 — and a relatively stable rupee, alongside upgraded international credit ratings.
Overall, the survey revealed a cautiously optimistic outlook from foreign investors on Pakistan’s business and investment climate.

OICCI survey shows 73pc of top foreign investors view Islamabad as viable FDI destination

The survey highlighted Pakistan’s improved regional standing on investment viability compared to 2023 versus several peers, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, and the Philippines. “Parent company interest has increased, as 35pc of respondents reported that their headquarters are now considering Pakistan a priority destination for new FDI, compared to 24pc in 2023”.
 
 

Commenting on the Perception Survey 2025, OICCI President Yousaf Hussain said the notable upward shift in investor sentiment demonstrated that economic stability and policy coordination were beginning to deliver results. “Initiatives like the SIFC have provided a structured mechanism for investment facilitation and inter-governmental alignment. In the future, deeper private-sector inclusion and continued reforms in taxation and regulatory efficiency will be key to sustaining this momentum”, he said
The survey also found investor perception of business risk to have shifted favourably, moving from a predominantly high-risk to a medium-risk outlook, reflecting improved macroeconomic management and relative stability. However, the findings also indicated that structural bottlenecks continue to constrain Pakistan’s investment potential. “Among the most critical concerns, federal–provincial coordination received negative feedback from 57pc of respondents”.
 






According to the survey, 96pc of respondents reported higher energy costs, 95pc faced increased wage expenses, and 91pc cited higher domestic raw material costs. Over 80pc expressed concern over delayed tax refunds, which in most cases take more than two years to process. Furthermore, over half of respondents indicated that commercial disputes take over five years to resolve, highlighting the need for judicial reform and more efficient dispute resolution.
Members’ perceptions of Pakistan’s economic outlook have improved noticeably since 2023. When asked about their sector-specific expectations for the next two to three years, 58pc of respondents now foresee global economic growth, a significant rise from 40pc in the previous survey. “This improvement mirrors gains in key macroeconomic indicators, including greater inflation stability, exchange rate management, and stronger capital market performance”, the OICCI said.
 
 

The survey participants also recommended enhancing Pakistan’s digital and regulatory landscape, supported by stronger human capital and a comprehensive, sector-focused investment policy. They emphasised developing non-IT industrial capacity to diversify growth.
Strengthening Pakistan’s global image was also seen as vital to attracting long-term FDI.
On global perception, 82pc of respondents noted that negative international coverage continues to influence investment decisions, highlighting the need for a proactive communications strategy to project Pakistan’s economic recovery and reform progress at global forums.
The survey’s recommendations call for broadening the tax base, ensuring policy consistency, strengthening coordination between federal and provincial governments, and enhancing intellectual property rights enforcement to sustain investor confidence and attract long-term FDI.

The ‘UN Decade on Eco­system Restoration Wor­­ld Restoration Flag­ship Awa­rd’ for the project ‘Rever­s­ing Deforesta­tion and Deg­radation in High Conser­vation Value Chilgoza Pine Forests’ was announced during the 80th anniversary celebrations of the UN Food and Agriculture Org­anisation (FAO) and the World Food Forum held in in Rome, Italy, on Tuesday. 
Implemented between 2018 and 2025 under the Restoration Initiative, the project is a joint effort of the Ministry of Climate Change, provincial forest departments and FAO. It focuses on conserving and restoring the country’s unique Chilgoza pine forests across Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, Baloch­istan, and Gilgit-Baltistan, FAO said. 
Pine nuts generate over $25 million annually for Pakistan. FAO’s approach is now being scaled up with national resources, including $3m from the KP Forestry Department. 
According to FAO, restoration of 20 per cent of degraded Chilgoza forests has been achieved throu­­gh income-generating activities for local communities, such as pine nut processing units. 
Speaking at the award ceremony, PM’s adviser Dr Syed Tauqir Hussain Shah said the initiative had restored 3,800 hectares of degraded forest land.

Officials said that unidentified gunmen riding motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire on a check post of Frontier Corps in the Reko area of Buleda. As a result, one FC man lost his life while three others sustained injuries.
The security personnel deployed at the post retur­ned fire in retaliation, but the attackers managed to escape.
Following the incident, additional security forces rushed to the site and shif­ted the body and injured personnel to a nearby government health facility. 

Security forces launch search operation to trace assailants

Officials said that a search operation has been launched in the area to trace the attackers invol­ved in the incident.
Earlier, police had foiled an attempt by armed militants to storm a police station in Noshki late on Sunday evening.
Officials said that a group of militants hurled a hand grenade at the police station and opened fire with automatic weapons. The grenade exploded near the building, but no casualties were reported.
Police personnel immediately retaliated, returning fire after taking positions. The exchange of fire lasted for more than half an hour.
“A police team successfully foiled the militants’ attempt to enter the station after a fierce gun battle,” a senior police officer said, adding that the attackers fled the area after facing resistance.
Following the attack, security forces rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to track down the suspects.

Those on the list include TLP chief Saad Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi, and 21 other senior office-bearers, who are wanted in multiple cases registered in Lahore, Sheikhupura and other districts.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other national and provincial authorities have been directed to increase surveillance at notified checkpoints, international border crossings and airports.
 
 

According to reports, authorities are concerned that the TLP chief and his brother could use support networks in Karachi to evade prosecution.
According to a senior Punjab official, the names were forwarded at the province’s request after the individuals were nominated in over 100 FIRs, including about 80 that carry anti-terrorism and other serious charges. Of the 290 absconders, 23 are described as senior leaders involved in finance and agitation planning.
The official said that records of suspected financiers had been compiled through geo-fencing and analysis of transactions made to the TLP via bank accounts and other channels.
Names identified as funders have been shared with relevant police officers to initiate placement on the 4th Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, over suspected links with militant or sectarian outfits.
At a recent high-level meeting, the Punjab police decided to expand the scope of investigations to earlier cases from 2020 and 2021 involving alleged attacks on law enforcers during TLP-led protests, identifying several repeat offenders for renewed proceedings along with cases related to the 2025 unrest.
The meeting also ordered a review of past incidents targeting Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship in Punjab, where the TLP was allegedly involved.
The Punjab police command has also decided to engage former Lahore Investigation DIG Imran Kishwar, currently serving as Admin DIG Lahore, to oversee case preparation. He has been tasked with supervising crime-scene work, fingerprint analysis, DNA testing, geofencing, geomapping, call data analysis, and related forensic work. Mr Kishwar previously led high-profile investigations related to the May 9 violent protests.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has finalised an agreement with a group of moderate Sunni clerics to transfer management of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries previously raised or operated by the TLP.
In Sahiwal, the names of 12 TLP men were placed on the Fourth Schedule via a notification issued by deputy commissioner on the department’s direction.

“Turkish Foreign Mini­ster Hakan Fidan invited the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Turkiye for the forthcoming meeting next week of the eight Foreign Ministers of partner countries who were engaged on the sidelines of UNGA80 in the diplomatic process on Gaza,” the Foreign Office said in a statement on Tuesday.
The FO said Dar and Fidan discussed the evolving situation in Gaza, and the next steps and modalities for achieving lasting peace in Palestine.
 






In September, eight Ar­ab and Muslim-majority countries — Pakistan, Tur­k­­iye, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan — for­m­ed a group to work with US President Donald Tru­mp to end the Israel-Hamas war. Convened on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, the group built on the 2023 Arab-Islamic Contact Group to align with Trump’s 20-point peace plan.
The coalition’s goals included an immediate ceasefire; the exchange of all hostages and remains of those killed; deployment of a multinational stabilisation force to secure and demilitarize Gaza; and Gulf-funded reconstruction of the enclave as a terror-free economic zone. It also supports Gaza–West Bank unification and a two-state solution, while advancing regional normalisation under the Abraham Accords framework.
The upcoming meeting of the group follows weeks of deliberations within the coalition of Muslim and Arab-majority states. Earlier, officials said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the international stabilisation force being assembled for Gaza, amid indications that the decision is leaning toward participation. Officials had claimed that discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”.
Army chief Gen Asim Munir also visited Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the past few days to discuss the plan for Gaza and the proposed deployment of an international stabilisation force. With the coalition’s next meeting scheduled for next week in Turkiye, it is expected that a final Pakistani decision is likely to be announced following those discussions.
Besides Pakistan, Indonesia and Azerbaijan are also tipped to contribute troops to the stabilisation force, while Israel has rejected Turkish participation.
The issue was also raised during Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar’s meeting with his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan in Riyadh. “The two leaders discussed bilateral relations, regional and international developments, including the situation in Gaza, and reaffirmed their shared commitment to cooperation at multilateral fora, including the United Nations,” FO said.
Refutation of Indian media report
On the other hand, the Ministry of Information issued clarification regarding a FirstPost report titled “With Munir’s CIA-Mossad deal, Pakistan to send 20,000 troops to Gaza under post-war plan”. The clarification rejected the report’s contents, noting that earlier coverage by Dawn (mentioned as a private newspaper) was quoted out of context and that the so-called intelligence sources cited in the FirstPost story were “misleading and concocted”.
However, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”, Dawn.com added.
Asked whether any such move was in the offing or not, the defence minister told Geo News: “This thing has to be finalised [and] it is in process. The government will take a decision after passing through the process and I don’t want to preempt it.” He said parliament wou­ld be taken onboard and all institutions would be informed about the move.
He said if Muslim countries took a decision to participate in the peace force and Pakistan also had to take part, then it wou­ld be a ‘moment of pride’ for the country to protect Palest­i­n­ians. “This is an opportunity that Paki­st­an should avail if it is available to us,” he said.

• CM vows to file contempt plea over Adiala jail restrictions
• KP opposition says absence of cabinet impacting govt affairs
ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR: After Khyber Pakhtu­n­k­h­wa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was once again barred from meeting his incarcerated party founder, Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
On Tuesday, CM Afridi arrived in Rawalpindi for a third time to meet Imran Khan in the Adiala jail, ostensibly to discuss the KP cabinet formation. However, he was not allowed to meet the party chief despite court orders in this regard.
Meanwhile, KP opposition members in the provincial assembly criticised  the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Last week, CM Afridi was denied the meeting and held a brief sit-in before returning empty-handed. This time, he said he’d move a contempt of court petition to contest the restrictions.
Speaking to media persons outside the prison, CM Afridi said he would file a contempt plea in the Islamabad High Court. He said it was his constitutional right to meet the PTI founder, as he was nominated by Imran Khan and was the representative of the people of KP.
He reiterated that he wanted to seek guidance from the party founder regarding the composition of the provincial cabinet and vowed to nominate ministers after meeting with Mr Khan.
However, Uzma Khanum, who was allowed to meet her brother on Monday, told reporters that Mr Khan wanted Sohail Afridi to go ahead with cabinet formation.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala, Ms Khanum said she had a message for the KP CM, since he could not meet the former premier.
“The CM should form a cabinet of his choice and as per the need of the hour,” the PTI founder was quoted as saying by his sister.
The message called on CM Afridi to “pick a small team”, while Ms Khanum said her brother had not proposed any names for inclusion in the provincial cabinet.
She said Imran Khan had also expressed concerns over the delay in the notification of Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the National Assembly opposition leader. She clarified that only party secretary Salman Akram Raja was empowered to relay messages to the party on Mr Khan’s behalf, to avoid confusion.
Deployment of troops in Gaza
Meanwhile, the PTI demanded clarification from the federal government regarding reports of the proposed deployment of Pakistani troops in Gaza. “The decision to send Pakistan’s armed forces to Gaza is an extremely sensitive national matter which must only be made through transparent consultation and with broad national consensus,” the party said, asking the government to take parliament, the political leadership, and the nation into confidence.

• Islamabad, Riyadh sign Economic Cooperation Framework to launch ‘strategic and high-impact projects’
• Energy, industry, mining, IT, tourism, agriculture and food security sectors to be main focus
ISLAMABAD: Ruling out loans as a driver of economic recovery, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday called for mutual cooperation to support countries like Pakistan that are battered by climate catastrophes.
Speaking during a high-level roundtable discussion at the 9th Future Investment Initiative Conference 2025 in Riyadh, PM Shehbaz said that repeated loans would erode the economic might of such countries, stagnating economic development.
“If humanity had to move forward, it should proceed in unison, share its bounties and grievances together and extend modern technologies with those countries which can use it to grow its production in the areas of agriculture, industry, and employment among others,” he said.
The PM’s remarks came after Pakistan and Saudi Arabia launched the Economic Cooperation Framework, based on shared economic interests.
The decision to launch the framework was taken during a Monday meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
“As part of the framework, several strategic and high-impact projects will be discussed in the economic, trade, investment and development fields that will contribute to strengthening cooperation between the two governments, enhan­cing the pivotal role of the private sector, and increasing trade exchange between the two countries,” the statement read.
It added that the deal would prioritise sectors including energy, industry, mining, information technology, tourism, agriculture and food security. Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries, and cooperation in the energy field.
 
 

“This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.
Celebrating the announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said: “Another historic chapter unfolds in Pakistan-Saudi relations.” He said the developed marked a “high point” in the bilateral partnership in trade, energy and investment.
Investment summit
Participating in a discussion at the 9th Edition of the Future Investment Initiative, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was rich in resources. He said “very honest mistakes” were made in the country’s history but it had learnt from them. “Important thing is to learn from your mistakes and that is what we are doing. At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption.
The prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”.
He said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the 2022 and 2025 floods. “This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards.” If humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”, he added.
He said Pakistan was fast moving towards the inc­r­e­asing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter. He said the global north and the global south should sit down and come to an agreement on the equitable distribution of resources for an egalitarian economy for all.

• Faryal Talpur meets AJK president to seek forward bloc’s support
• PTI to file disqualification references against defecting lawmakers
ISLAMABAD: The PPP is likely to announce its nominee for the office of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) prime minister on Wednesday (today), following a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif upon the latter’s return from Saudi Arabia.
Sources told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Faisal Rathore and Sardar Yaqub are under consideration for the top slot.
Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister. The no-trust motion will be submitted soon after the PPP finalises its candidate.
A PPP source said there was ‘no hurry’ to form the new government, adding that the PML-N’s decision not to join the treasury benches was “its democratic right”. The party insists it will move ahead “with consensus”.
According to sources, a detailed charge sheet highlighting the AJK prime minister’s alleged governance failures has been prepared.
These complaints include his failure to consult cabinet members, his harsh attitude toward bureaucracy, and cuts to development funds for ministers and assembly members. His unilateral decisions and weak handling of public protests have reportedly deepened dissatisfaction within the coalition.
In a related development, Faryal Talpur, head of the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, called on AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry to seek support from six members of the forward bloc belonging to his group. She discussed matters pertaining to formation of the new government in Azad Kashmir during the meeting.
Speaking to Dawn, PML-N leader Mushtaq Minhas clarified that if the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister resigns, the party will not vote for the PPP candidate, though it will support a no-confidence motion, if tabled.
He said the PML-N had been seeking Anwarul Haq’s removal for the past six months over governance concerns.
PTI to file references
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has decided to file references against its defected members who have joined other parties or plan to support the no-confidence motion.
PTI AJK President Abdul Qayyum Niazi held consultations with Opposition Leader Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and summoned the party’s legal team.
According to sources, references will be filed under Section 30 of the Elections Act 2020, which allows the disqualification of members who switch parties.
PTI had earlier sent a reference to the speaker against four members — Akmal Sargala, Rafiq Nayyar, and Ali Shan Soni among them.
Now, 12 members of the PTI forward bloc who have joined the PPP could face disqualification if they vote for the no-confidence motion.

Openers Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, promoted to set the tone, managed a cautious 31 before Lizaad Williams shattered Farhan’s stumps with a nip-backer for 24 off 19 balls.
The dismissal brought Babar Azam to the crease for his much-anticipated T20I comeback, but the former skipper lasted just two deliveries, chipping a short-of-length ball from Bosch straight to cover for a golden duck.
 






Skipper Salman Ali Agha’s wretched night continued when he was trapped plumb in front by Bosch for two, Pakistan sliding to 43 for three in the eighth over.
Saim, who had laboured to 37 off 28 balls with four sixes, finally holed out to long-on off Linde, triggering a middle-order meltdown.
Usman Khan, the wicketkeeper-batsman, looked composed for his 12 before being stumped charging Linde. Hasan Nawaz fell for three, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, while Faheem Ashraf’s attempted reverse-sweep off Linde lobbed tamely to point for one.
Mohammad Nawaz provided late resistance with a combative 36 off 20 balls, including two sixes and four boundaries. His audacious scoop for six off Nandre Burger in the 18th over briefly raised hopes, but he perished in the next over, skying Williams to long-off.
 






Shaheen Shah Afridi muscled a four before falling to Bosch’s return catch for four, and Naseem Shah’s spirited nine ended with a thin edge behind off the same bowler. Abrar Ahmed was left stranded as Williams sealed the rout.
Earlier, Nawaz and Saim were impressive with their spin bowling on a batting-friendly surface to restrict South Africa to 194-9.
Nawaz (3-26) and Saim (2-31) kept the hosts from posting a 200-plus score despite Reeza Hendricks’ half century.
South Africa, put into bat first after Pakistan won the toss, rode on Hendricks’ anchoring 60 and a late flourish from Linde in front of a capacity crowd.
The Proteas got off to a blazing start, with Quinton de Kock and Hendricks plundering 44 in the powerplay.
De Kock, returning to international T20 cricket after a lengthy hiatus, looked in ominous touch, striking five boundaries in his 23 off 13 balls.
 






However, part-time spinner Saim struck in the fourth over, inducing a thick edge from de Kock that was pouched at point by Faheem.
Tony de Zorzi, on T20I debut, announced himself with a flurry of strokes, smashing five fours and a six in his 33 off 16. The left-hander’s audacious lofted drive off Salman Ali Agha for six over long-on was the highlight of a 49-run second-wicket stand with Hendricks.
But Nawaz, introduced in the eighth over, turned the game on its head. The left-arm spinner deceived de Zorzi with a wide, full delivery outside off, leaving the batsman stranded as wicket-keeper Usman Khan effected a sharp stumping.
Nawaz was not done. He accounted for the dangerous Dewald Brevis for nine, the ball skidding low to crash into off-stump as the youngster attempted a premeditated slog-sweep.
 






Matthew Breetzke, promoted to number, struggled for timing and fell for one, pulling a short delivery from Saim straight to deep square leg. At 112 for four in the 11th over, South Africa were wobbling.
Skipper Donovan Ferreira tried to stabilise but managed only 10 before Nawaz struck again, breaching his defences with a skidding arm-ball.
Hendricks, who had played second fiddle during the early blitz, took charge thereafter. The opener brought up his fifty off 32 balls with a top-edged sweep off Saim that sailed for six.
He found an able ally in Linde, who injected momentum with a 34-ball 36, laced with four boundaries and a six.
The pair added 39 for the sixth wicket, with Linde’s slog-sweep off Abrar Ahmed for six in the 17th over standing out.
Shaheen bowling the 17th, was taken for 18 runs, including four streaky boundaries as Linde feasted on width. Hendricks looked set for a bigger score but fell in the 18th over, bowled by Abrar while attempting a cross-batted swipe.
Naseem removed Linde in the 19th over with a yorker that uprooted middle stump, while Shaheen returned to dismiss Corbin Bosch, caught at long-on.
 






The final over saw drama as Williams was run out attempting a suicidal single, Shaheen’s acrobatic collection and Usman’s presence of mind sealing the innings at 194 for nine.
While Nawaz and Saim flourished, Shaheen and Naseem were expensive, conceding 45 and 34 respectively, but struck late blows. Abrar, despite going for 42, claimed Hendricks’ prized scalp.
The total, while substantial, could have been higher had South Africa avoided the mid-innings collapse, but it turned out to be more than enough at the end.
The second T20I is scheduled for Friday in Lahore. For Pakistan, questions over batting intent, middle-order fragility, and captaincy loom large once again.</p><small>2025-10-28 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/282228338a4323e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951803/govt-changes-nccia-dg-as-corruption-scandal-widens' target='_blank'><strong>Govt changes NCCIA DG as corruption scandal widens</strong></a><br><p>The federal government replaced the director general of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on Tuesday amid an ongoing corruption scandal concerning its employees and other issues.
The federal government established the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combating cybercrime in Pakistan.
Notifications issued from the Cabinet Secretariat’s Establishment Division today said Syed Khurram Ali, a BS-21 officer of the police service, was appointed as the new NCCIA DG with immediate effect, replacing Waqaruddin Syed, who was directed to report to the division immediately.
The latter was appointed to the role in April.
Earlier today, a Lahore court granted the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) a three-day physical remand of six NCCIA officials in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes.
The first information report (FIR) of the case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered against nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials, at 7:35pm yesterday. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest yesterday.
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of another official nominated in the case — Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director of operations in Islamabad — have also been unknown for several days.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials about whom it emerged yesterday that they had been arrested by the FIA.
 
 

Meanwhile, unhappy with the performance of the NCCIA, the Punjab government has decided in pri­nciple to set up its own wing to deal with the rising incidents of cybercrime in the province.
After the NCCIA was established in May this year — replacing the FIA Cybercrime Wing — the Pun­jab government tried to develop a “working relationship” with the federal authority, but it did not yield results.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.</p><small>2025-10-28 17:43</small></div><hr>
