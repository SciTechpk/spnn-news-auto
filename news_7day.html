Asif, 33, played 21 ODIs and 58 T20Is, mainly as a finisher in the middle order.
“Wearing the Pakistan jersey has been the greatest honour of my life and serving my country on the cricket field has been my proudest chapter,” he said in a post on social media.
 






“To my fans, teammates, and coaches, thank you for your love, belief, and support through every high and low.
He made his T20I debut against West Indies in April 2018 after helping Islamabad United win the PSL that year, hitting three successive sixes at a crucial point in the chase in the final. Two months later, an ODI debut followed.
“To my family and friends, who stood with me in moments of joy and in ther deepest of trials, including the loss of my beloved daughter during the World Cup, your strength carried me forward,” he said.
 
 

He added: “I retire with immense gratitude, and InshaAllah will continue to share my passion for the game by playing domestic and league cricket worldwide.”
Asif was fined by the the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a fiery on-field spat with Fareed Ahmad of Afghanistan in their thrilling Asia Cup match in Sharjah.</p><small>2025-09-02 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01200725a2c335a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938934/with-sindh-facing-a-very-high-flood-heres-what-authorities-must-do-to-save-thousands-of-lives' target='_blank'><strong>With Sindh facing a ‘very high flood’, here’s what authorities must do to save thousands of lives</strong></a><br><p>The Indus River roars with a force that has tested Sindh time and again. As a learner of flood management, I have been directly part of the 1994, 1995, 1997, 2010, 2015 river floods and the 2003, 2005 (Balochistan), 2011 and 2022 rain-induced floods. And now, in just three to four days, a very high flood looms over the province, threatening to engulf us yet again.
The water is expected to surpass 700,000 cusecs with a 10-20 per cent margin of uncertainty, pushing possible peaks and likely hitting 775,000 to 850,000 cusecs. Upstream, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have already been battered by floods that have claimed hundreds of lives and shattered infrastructure, most of which was built in the waterway or flood plains of the rivers.
I have said this before, and I will say this again: people may forget, but rivers remember their ways.
In KP, forests, once lush green, have been shaved bald, causing fatal landslides. On the other hand, unplanned urbanisation, an inadequate flood-resilient infrastructure and poor river management have all aggravated the situation.
One mission
When it comes to Sindh, where 1.65 million lives are at stake, we stand at a pivotal moment: falter under criticism or unite — government, institutions, communities — in a singular mission to guide this flood to the sea and save our people, our province, our country.
The Sindh Irrigation Department, charged with taming this colossal flow, faces sharp scrutiny. Decades of weak flood infrastructure planning and execution, political interference, and systemic corruption across federal and provincial governance have eroded its capacity, a malaise echoing through Pakistan’s disaster management framework, laid bare by the 2010 and 2022 historical floods that displaced millions and caused over $30 billion in damages.
Yet, the department remains a cornerstone of flood-fighting, its engineers holding the line where newer entities such as the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) fall short. The revenue department and district administrations, despite inefficiencies rooted in their colonial and bureaucratic character, wield immense power to mobilise resources, coordinate relief, and enforce actions.
If we can shake off their rigid, outdated ways and rally them to the mission of saving the country and its citizens, their authority can turn positively for the vulnerable people and areas. Blanket criticism, especially now, risks breaking the spirit of those on the frontlines.
Between panic, criticism, and actions, the truth rings clear: saving lives comes first. Let us sharpen our critiques to target specific weaknesses — unrepaired barrage gates, riverbank encroachments, private embankments — and act swiftly to mend them.
The challenge
Sindh faces a unique challenge: the Indus flows on an elevated ridge, higher than the surrounding land, with no breaching sections or escape routes for excess water. When the river breaks free, as it did in the 2010 Tori Bund breach, it carves paths hundreds of miles long, flooding areas like Manchhar Lake and drowning Khairpur Nathan Shah.
Since 2010, promises of projects for river outlets and flood escape canals have stalled, leaving us with one task: to guide the floods to the sea safely. The province’s 1,400 miles of embankments, with 875 miles as the first line of defence along the Indus, hold over 140 vulnerable points prone to erosion, scouring, or breaches. The water’s speed demands we fortify this first line of defence at Guddu first, then almost immediately at Sukkur, and finally at Kotri barrages.
 
 

At the heart of this crisis are 1.65 million people in the riverine katcha areas across 14 districts — Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Hyderabad, Thatta — where 273,000 families, their homes, crops, and livestock face peril. Once, indigenous floodplain communities thrived through nomadic resilience, moving to higher ground with ancestral knowledge of the river’s rhythms, and knew exactly at what river discharge, what coping mechanism was to be applied.
But the rise of an aggressive agriculture-based economy has rooted permanent settlements — concrete homes and farmlands — that now stand vulnerable. Encroachments for crops have choked natural flood channels, heightening risks of erosion and breaches, as seen in past devastations.
Landowners in these areas deserve economic benefits, but these must align with historical practices, British-era surveys, water laws, and our Constitution, ensuring no one’s profit endangers another’s life.
Bracing for the upcoming water flows, evacuations have begun with over 24,000 people moved to over 300 relief camps. Yet, many cling to their katcha homes, unwilling to abandon their livestock (read: their lifeline).
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro are inspecting sites, including the Guddu Barrage, their presence signalling urgency. To reach katcha residents, mobile relief units — equipped with boats, emergency supplies, and veterinary support — must deliver aid on-site, honouring traditional coping strategies while addressing modern risks.
The agony and pain of camp life were demonstrated in the 2022 floods, and the same echoes in Punjab’s recent flood camps — a horrible experience, especially for women and the elderly.
The plan
From decades of facing floods, a clear path emerges — a multi-layered strategy to safeguard Sindh.
First and foremost, fortify the frontline. Urgent repairs to embankments and barrage gates must begin with Guddu, then Sukkur, and Kotri. The “three Ms” — man, material, machinery — are the foundation: active camps, trained staff, excavators, bulldozers, flood-fighting equipment, and open supply routes.
At the same time, small details matter — mosquito repellent for workers, life jackets for those measuring river levels by boat. Real-time monitoring through satellite data and field river gauge observations, with alerts in Sindhi and Urdu, will keep us ahead of the flood. It must be round the clock, not leaving the frontline unattended for a spur-of-the-moment.
The next step is the mobilisation of all institutions, from the revenue department to the local administration. They must shed their colonial bureaucratic shackles, enforce actions, and join the engineers of the irrigation department who hold “unity of command” per the Bund Manual — a document detailing rules for river channel operation and maintenance.
Narrow bridges, like Dadu-Moro, choke floodwaters, as seen in 2010 when a cut in the approach road saved a city. Inspect and widen bridge approaches now. The 2022 Sindh Indus River Commission’s plan to expand all bridges must move forward, no matter the cost, once we have safely handled the current floods.
 
 

Separately, local leaders and residents must support watch posts and patrols, armed with spades and torches. Social media can dispel rumours or confirm threats, but only if we visit sites and act. Updated data on private embankments — ordered removed post-2010 by the Supreme Court — is critical. Have they returned by 2025?
Next comes delivering relief, particularly to those who need it the most. Start with evacuating women, children and the elderly. Camps need food, water, medicines, and document pouches, with mobile health units to curb disease outbreaks.
A national emergency can align federal and provincial efforts, with the NDMA leading to ease Sindh’s isolation. The authority has both power and money, but they are least linked with communities on the ground. Here, the irrigation department and other organisations can provide links and connectivity.
Transparent resource allocation, overseen by opposition leaders and civil society, will silence corruption allegations. Ad hoc task forces, guided by neutral bodies like the Supreme Court-mandated water commission, can mend institutional gaps.
Coming together
This flood exposes deep challenges.
The PPP’s governance since 2008 has faced accusations of prioritising elite projects over resilient infrastructure, while federal-provincial disputes over water persist. Pakistan’s reactive flood management, stalling reforms, amplifies climate-driven risks. The National Flood Protection Program IV has been in the doldrums for the last eight years or so.
 
 

Yet, in this moment, the Quran’s wisdom guides us: “Whoever saves one life, it is as if they have saved all of humanity.”
With hours ticking down, all relevant public sector departments, and all of Sindh must unite — shedding bureaucratic inertia for a mission to save lives, Sindh, and Pakistan. Long-term reforms — vulnerability mapping, anti-encroachment drives, sustainable agriculture — await, but today, we guide this flood to the sea, as the Indus waters wait for no one.

The 35-year-old left-armer retires as the nation’s most prolific fast bowler in the format, with 79 wickets from 65 T20Is, second on the all-time Australia list to spin bowling teammate Adam Zampa.
Test cricket is and has always been my highest priority,” he said in a Cricket Australia statement on Tuesday.
 






“I have loved every minute of every T20 game I have played for Australia, particularly the 2021 World Cup, not just because we won but the incredible group and the fun along the way.
“Looking ahead to an away Indian test tour, the Ashes and an ODI World Cup in 2027, I feel this is my best way forward to remain fresh, fit and at my best for those campaigns.
“It also gives the bowling group time to prepare for the T20 World Cup in the matches leading into that tournament.”
Starc was not included in Australia’s T20I squad released on Tuesday for the upcoming series against New Zealand.
Selectors chairman George Bailey said the rangy, swing-bowling maestro would be hard to replace.
“His ability to impact early with the new ball and bowl clutch overs at the death (will be missed),” he told reporters on Tuesday.
“You don’t find many swinging it at 145km per hour. His fielding’s also outstanding.
“We won’t replace him like-for-like, but we’ve exposed others to key roles — Nathan Ellis, Ben Dwarshuis, Sean Abbott, and Xavier Bartlett.”
Starc played a pivotal role in Australia’s first and only T20 World Cup title in 2021, taking nine wickets in seven matches in the United Arab Emirates.
 
 

His retirement, 13 years on from his 2012 debut, is a big blow for Australia’s hopes of another T20 World Cup triumph next year and continues the winding-down of a golden generation of players.
Following opening batsman David Warner’s retirement last year, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis have all retired from the one-day game.
Cricket Australia boss Todd Greenberg praised Starc for making “significant sacrifices” to play for his country.
“To allow the next crop of fast bowlers a clear path to the T20 World Cup early next year is another example of putting team first,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-02 04:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02091411eb1a4ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939053/flour-prices-climb-as-supply-concerns-mount' target='_blank'><strong>Flour prices climb as supply concerns mount</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Wheat and flour prices have surged sharply in Karachi’s wholesale market, raising fresh concerns about food inflation and market supply, despite government assurances of sufficient national stocks.
Wholesale wheat now sells for Rs90 per kg, up from Rs72 in mid-August and Rs62 in July. This increase has pushed the price of flour no. 2.5 to Rs97 per kg and fine flour to Rs103, compared with Rs81 and Rs85, respectively. In early August, these prices were Rs74 and Rs79 per kg.
Chakki flour varieties are now available at wholesale rates between Rs110 and Rs135 per kg, marking an average rise of Rs20 per kg. According to the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending Aug 28, the price of a 10kg wheat bag climbed to Rs794 from Rs640. Consequently, 20kg wheat flour bags now sell between Rs1,700 and Rs2,100, while one kg of fine flour is priced at Rs106 — up from Rs1,350–1,700 and Rs93, respectively, in early August.
With flour prices continuing to rise, a further burden on consumers is expected once roti and naan (bread) sellers adjust their prices to reflect higher input costs.

Despite govt claims of adequate stocks, wholesale wheat rate hits Rs90/kg in Karachi

This surge comes despite a statement last week by National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, who, while chairing the 8th Wheat Board meeting, claimed the country had 33.47 million tonnes of wheat against a requirement of 33.58m tonnes — a marginal shortfall of just 0.11m tonnes. He said the situation was under control and ruled out wheat imports, asserting that existing stocks were sufficient.
However, market stakeholders dispute the government’s assessment. Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), Rauf Ibrahim, said the claimed availability figure includes 400,000-500,000 tonnes from last year’s leftover stock. He estimated the actual crop size at 29-30m tonnes this year, of which 3-4m tonnes have already been diverted for livestock feed.
He questioned the disconnect between rising prices and the government’s claim of ample stocks. He criticised the government’s decision to suspend wheat procurement by flour mills and remove the support price under the IMF programme, saying it had created a free-market environment that benefits hoarders, speculators, and flour millers — but not consumers.
Rauf warned that the discontinuation of wheat procurement had left flour millers without official quotas, which previously helped stabilise the market. He added that farmers who sold wheat at Rs2,200 per 40kg are now at a loss, while flour millers continue to store grain in private silos.
 
 

With the next wheat crop due in March/April 2026, he urged the government to act urgently to curb hoarding and safeguard consumers, warning that flour prices could exceed Rs200 per kg in the coming months if left unchecked.
A flour miller echoed concerns about the stock data, claiming the total crop size this year is closer to 28m tonnes. He also feared that flooding in Punjab may have damaged some of the carryover stock being counted in the government’s total availability figures.
Asad Ali of Topline Securities said the recent wheat price rebound could incentivise farmers in the upcoming Rabi season. After facing depressed returns in the previous crop cycle, the recovery in prices may boost sowing sentiment.
Agricultural growth slowed to 0.6pc in FY25 from 6.4pc in FY24, as adverse weather, water shortages, and rising input costs undermined farm profitability. Major crop output fell 13.5pc year-on-year, with wheat production declining by 9pc. According to FFC estimates, farmers lost Rs10,695 per acre this year, compared with profits of Rs13,572 per acre last season.
SBP estimates an 11pc decline in wheat production for FY25 due to weak profitability, which discouraged sowing. Asad noted that although current wheat prices remain 43pc below the previous peak of Rs1,256 per 10kg, the latest price spike offers some relief to struggling farmers.
He added that the current rebound may help restore confidence in wheat cultivation, provided the government ensures better market regulation and protection for farmers.

• IOM to coordinate, with UN Resident Coordinator Mohamed Yahya as network chair
• Pakistan’s first Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund Programme also launched
ISLAMABAD: The United Nations launched on Monday the Network on Migration in Pakistan to strengthen migration management and governance to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration.
The establishment of the United Nations Network on Migration (UNNM) marked a significant step towards a unified, collaborative approach to migration governance and responding to the inter-connected challenges of human trafficking and migration smuggling.
The network has been established in Pakistan in pursuance of the ‘New York Declaration for Refugees and Migration’, unanimously adopted by UN member states in 2016, which created the UNNM. The declaration marked a major commitment to address large movements of people and laid the foundation for two global compacts, including one on safe, orderly and regular migration
It is aligned with international frameworks, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), which is the first comprehensive, intergovernmental framework on migration.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as coordinator and secretariat of the UN Network on Migration, plays a central role in the network, alongside the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Pakistan, who will serve as the network’s chair. The network will leverage partnerships across the UN system to promote policy coherence and integrate migration policies into the broader development goals.
 






Speaking at the launch ceremony, UN Resident Coordinator in Pakistan Mohamed Yahya said the network provides a crucial platform to shift the narrative on migration, amplify a unified voice, and foster the innovation needed to address complex challenges related to mobility and protecting the rights of all people on the move.
Coinciding with the UNNM launch, Pakistan’s first Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund Programme (MMPTF) was also launched.  The MMPTF aimed at ‘Streng­thening Response to Combat Trafficking in Persons’ and ‘Smuggling of Migrants in Pakistan’ is being implemented jointly by the IOM and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in collaboration with the Pakistan government, private sector, and civil society.
The joint programme supports national efforts in migration management and governance and in combatting human trafficking and migrant smuggling with a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. The MMPTF was established to support the implementation of GCM and is the only pooled funding mechanism dedicated to migration, open to all states.
In a video message, Head of UN Migration Network Secretariat Jonathan Prentice congratulated Pakistan for continuing to play a significant role in the global effort to help improve migration governance in the world.
The launching ceremony also featured a Pakistani migrant recently returned from an arduous journey to Europe and reintegrated back home. “Life makes us move. But journeys, either from our home to new destinations or back to our country, should become easier and more dignified,” said Moazzam Ali, who opted for voluntary return to Pakistan from Romania with IOM’s support.
A high-level panel discussion titled “Enhancing Whole-of-Government Migration Governance in the Age of Complex Mobility Dynamics and Emerging Global Challenges” was also held. It was moderated by Dr Nasra M. Shah, Professor of Migration and Development at the Lahore School of Economics. Panelists included representatives from the ministries of foreign affairs, interior, overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, the National Commission for Human Rights, IOM, and civil society organisations.
Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025</p><small>2025-09-02 04:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02090201dedeaa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939054/dollarised-returns-for-oil-transport-approved' target='_blank'><strong>Dollarised returns for oil transport approved</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Despite strong reservations from the ministries of finance and power, the government has approved a dollar-based guaranteed return on the transportation of petroleum products through the 477-kilometre Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline, estimated to cost $300 million.
The project will be executed on a government-to-government basis by a joint venture comprising Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company SOCAR, Pakistan State Oil (PSO), and the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). Positioned as a strategic investment from Azerbaijan, the project had long been advocated by the FWO using local resources.
At a recent meeting, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved the terms and conditions proposed by the Petroleum Division to launch the project, citing its potential to enhance bilateral ties with Azerbaijan and attract future investment.
However, official documents reviewed by Dawn reveal that Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari cautioned against offering guaranteed dollar returns. He noted that lessons should have been learned from the experience with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). He urged a detailed assessment of costs and internal rate of return (IRR) before proceeding.

ECC clears $300m oil pipeline project with Azerbaijan amid ministries’ concerns

SOCAR had conditioned its investment on a “ship-or-pay” model — similar to the “take-or-pay” model used in IPP agreements — requiring full payment for the pipeline’s annual capacity of 7-8 million tonnes, regardless of actual throughput.
The Ministry of Finance also raised objections, warning that dollar-based returns should be linked strictly to foreign investment. It stressed that such returns should not apply if local financing is used. The ministry also recommended extending the payback period from four to seven years to mitigate the early-stage tariff impacts and called for more realistic assumptions regarding interest rates and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Despite these concerns, the Petroleum Division argued that the proposed changes would render the project unattractive to investors. The ECC, siding with the Petroleum Division, overruled both ministries’ objections, terming the pipeline a strategic opportunity that could unlock further foreign investment.
The FWO had initially proposed a 14.6pc IRR and a 25pc equity IRR. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) noted that the project’s final cost would depend on the adopted financing and operational model. The ECC partially addressed concerns by deciding that dollarised returns would apply only if foreign investment is involved.
Currently, about 70pc of petroleum products in Pakistan are transported by road, 28pc through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Machike, and only 2pc by rail. The new pipeline aims to shift a greater share of oil transport to pipeline infrastructure, reducing costs and inefficiencies.
 
 

As part of the approved framework, Ogra will allow transportation tariffs to be denominated in US dollars and will declare the pipeline as the default mode of oil transport.
Oil Marketing Companies will be required to commit to minimum annual pipeline volumes. Any shortfall will be adjusted through their existing Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM). If collective commitments fall below the threshold, the shortfall will be covered through the national IFEM mechanism.
The FWO has already submitted a revised tariff petition for the Machike–Thallian section, which Ogra has accepted. A separate petition for the Thallian–Tarujabba section is under review. Although Ogra has determined a provisional dollar-based tariff, the details remain confidential.

During the hearing, Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan, sisters of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, were present in the court.
When the matter came up for hearing, the investigating officer sought more time from the judge to present the case record before the court.
However, the defence counsel argued that the prosecution’s failure to produce the record amounted to “delaying tactics”.
Shershah, who has been on judicial remand in the May 9 violence case pertaining to the attack on the Jinnah House, the residence of Lahore corps commander, had approached the court for release on post-arrest bail.
After hearing initial arguments from both sides, Judge Manzer Ali Gill allo­w­­ed the prosecution counsel’s request and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday (today).

The latest polio case involved a 20-month-old girl from Ping union coun­cil of Tank district, an official of NIH confirmed.
“This is the 14th polio case from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province this year. With this detection, the total number of polio cases found in the country in 2025 reached 24. The break-up of the polio cases is: 16 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six in Sindh, and one each in Punjab and Gilgit-Balti­stan,” the official said.
He said the victim belo­nged to ​Bettani tribe, adding that the case belonged to highly security compromised area not accessible for vaccination and no travel history was found.
Meanwhile, a week-long special polio campaign was launched in 26 of the 36 districts in Balochistan amid tight security. Provi­ncial authorities have made strict security arran­g­eme­nts to ensure safety of the polio workers in view of the recent target killing of a supervisor of the Polio Pro­g­ramme in Chaman, a town bordering Afghan­istan.
He was targeted by armed men in Roghani area of Chaman while taking part in creating awareness among the parents along with polio workers before launching the campaign in the area.
“We are providing tight security to our polio workers in all the 26 districts where polio staff was administering polio drops and vaccination,” a senior official told Dawn, adding that during the week-long campaign more than 2.18 million children under the age of five will be administered anti-polio drops.
The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Balochistan Coordinator Inam-ul-Haq while announcing the campaign programme said that during the drive in the province more than 2.18 million children under the age of five will be administered anti-polio drops.
Calling the campaign, a crucial step in the fight against poliovirus, Mr Haq urged parents to ensure their children receive the vaccine, warning that failure to do so could result in lifelong disability.
“All preparations have been finalised, and vaccination teams have been fully mobilised in both urban and remote areas of the province,” he said.
The campaign was launched in Quetta, Pishin, Qilla Abdullah, Chaman, Barkhan, Dera Bugti, Hub, Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi, Kalat, Khuzdar, Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, Mastung, Noshki, Nasirabad, Sherani, Sibi, Sohbatpur, Usta Mohammad, Zhob, Musakhail, Chagai, Duki, Lasbela, and Ziarat.
A total of 11,659 teams will take part in the drive, including 9,129 mobile teams, 958 fixed-site teams, and 586 transit teams deployed at bus terminals, railway stations, and other key locations. Mr Haq stressed that the success of the campaign depends heavily on the community support. He appealed to civil society members, teachers and religious leaders to help raise awareness about polio among the masses and encourage families to get their children vaccinated.
Alongside the polio campaign, he also reminded parents of the importance of routine immunisation, which protects children against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and diphtheria.
He urged families to visit their nearest health centers to ensure their children receive all scheduled vaccines on time.

But for the residents of Kotli Loharan, a peri-urban community located on the outskirts of Sialkot, it is the lack of drainage — not fences — which has neighbours virtually at each other’s throats.
The town’s western side, through which the Khannay Wala Nullah flows, is slightly more elevated than the eastern side. The area has always been prone to flooding whenever the river overflows, but in the past, the water would find its course through the alleyways of the community in the form of rivulets and end up in the seasonal drain.
This time around, however, the sheer amount of water is staggering to behold, and it has not been able to find its natural path to drain into the nullah.
Make no mistake, both the eastern and western ends of Kotli Loharan are submerged; but while the water level to the east is around 6 feet, the west side is under half that depth.

Residents on one side want culverts dismantled so floodwater can drain into the nullah, a proposal that has faced stiff opposition from those that dwell near the seasonal drain

Over the past five to six days, residents of the eastern side have struggled to dismantle culverts in a bid to divert the water west, so it can flow into the Khannay Wala Nullah.
This plan has faced stiff resistance from those who dwell on the other side, who have blocked efforts by locals and the district administration to make any cuts that would add to their watery woes.
This post-flood situation has created internal rifts, differences and given birth to water politics in the area — which is already reeling from outbreaks of disease brought on by the deep, stagnant waters – and curtailing cooperation with the government to deal with such situations.
“We have been cut off from Sialkot since Aug 26, as floodwaters are still present in our area, inside our homes,” says Zafar Abbas Bukhari, a resident of the eastern side. “Many of our children and elderly people are ill and getting medicines from relief camps and other sources. But the issue is yet to be resolved,” he tells us.
 
 

Another youth, Inam, narrates how he would ride into town on a tractor trolley to buy groceries, and then make the perilous journey back, just so his family could eat.
Mr Bukhari says officials had brought excavators to break down the culverts to allow the water to drain out the other side. But people from western side of Kotli Loharan had the work forcefully halted, arguing that their homes would be submerged under yet more water if this were to happen.
According to Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali, the issue in Kotli Loharan stems from the subdivision of agricultural land and the development on residential zones on it.
It has become common practice; first, structures are built illegally, then residents start demanding the construction of roads, sewage and other infrastructure, she deplored.

Massive flows
On Aug 26, a flood of around 400,000 cusecs hit Head Marala — near Sialkot — during the night. The flow increased rapidly to 917,525 cusecs, causing widespread flooding.
Although relief camps were reportedly made operational, many residents did not hear the announcements and remained in bed, leading to 22 fatalities in Sialkot city and Sambrial tehsil.
The devastating collapse of the Hanji bridge at Nullah Dek only compounded the area’s problems.
Official data indicates that Sialkot tehsil was impacted by the overflowing of both nullahs, Dek and Palkhu, as they exceeded safe limits.
The damage so far include two collapse bridges, 46 culverts, 36 roads and 340,240 acres of cropland affected.
Unfortunately, Sialkot city and its suburbs still lack a modern drainage system, with domestic waste and storm water being pumped and disposed through the same sewage lines, laid decades ago.
The government also started a plan, implemented under the Punjab Intermediate Cities Improvement Investment Programme, with support from the Asian Development Bank some years ago, but it is yet to become operational due to various pending engineering issues, including the desilting of nullahs.

The debate has been sparked, it seems. And it wasn’t just due to forwarded-as-received WhatsApp posts, which ‘announced’ multiple, smaller provinces but also the research presented by media owners-turned-public intellectuals, who are so convinced of the need for this reform that they are now trying to shape opinion at large.
The government and its allies profess ignorance and deny that any such move is in the offing. But the rest of us know better and are taking these ‘mazameen’ (inspiration) from ‘ghaib’ (unknown) rather seriously. After all, unlike the government, the rest are openly aware of the importance of the unknown. As a result, the debate rages on.
More provinces are needed, we are told. India has been carving out states whenever needed. It helps improve governance because the ‘seat’ of the government is closer to the people; for instance, the people of south Punjab would find, say, Multan more accessible than Lahore. It would also ensure cities such as Karachi get the resources and attention they deserve. And, aside from these other benefits, some argue, it would also weaken political dynasties that control entire provinces.
But not everyone is convinced. In fact, there has been commentary and discussions highlighting how cumbersome and time-consuming the process of establishing new provinces could be. For instance, every new province requires a two-thirds majority in the relevant assembly and even if this is managed, it would be followed by a drawn-out process of administrative measures (such as the drawing up of new boundaries) and the setting up of governments in multiple parts of the country. It has been asked if this would not add to the existing polarisation. Local government has been offered as a solution — an alternative that has, perhaps, more supporters than the idea of new provinces.

Whether the empowerment of the people is really the objective is the question.

These proposals have generated an interest because of the acknowledgment that the current political system is not working and — whether in democratic set-up or a hybrid dispensation — all political parties have struggled with governance and implementation of the needed reform. This is the silent consensus regardless of party affiliation — other than the party heads who have turned parties and provinces into fiefdoms and have no interest in any change. Indeed, the 18th Amendment has ensured the older, mainstream parties now only have regional ambitions, ie, dominating the provinces rather than trying to increase their cross-country appeal. There is a direct link between the 18th Amendment and the increasing focus of the PPP in Sindh and the PML-N in Punjab.
 
 

But this is a digression. Most others realise the need for change in the political set-up, assuming, or rather hoping, that this will lead to badly needed reform, especially in the economic sphere, and an improvement in governance.
However, the various discussions on the topic should not ignore the larger, political context in which these solutions are conjured up. And this larger context is one in which political parties are hampered, civilian space is limited (if not non-existent) and very unsubtle efforts are being made to argue that parliamentary politics and parties have failed to deliver.
In the past, whenever we have had similar moments, the devolution of power has always been offered as the magical solution. This age-old formula is supposed to ease the people’s misery, empower them and rid them of corrupt politicians. But whether the empowerment of the people is really the objective is the question because it is offered at moments when the centralisation of power is also at play. It appears as if the present times may prove to be no different.
But this is not all. The second issue is that such efforts rarely prove permanent. Just consider Pervez Musharraf’s local government system. By the time general elections were held in 2002 and ‘parliamentary democracy’ restored, the politicians at the provincial and national level began to slowly reverse or weaken the local government systems. Come 2008, and the system was more or less wrapped up.
Once the 18th Amendment was passed, power was concentrated at the provincial level, and the local governments were left to the mercy of each government (the amendment conveniently allowed each provincial assembly to pass its own local government act and decide how much powers to devolve). Initially, even this legislation was delayed till pressure from the courts forced the hand of the provincial governments. And the parties running the provinces made sure they passed legislation that led to weak and ineffective local governments. Perhaps one can say that the local governments enjoyed about as much power as the present federal government does. Even the PTI, which introduced a relatively stronger local government in KP, progressively weakened them as time went on.
Hence, it might not be a waste of time to ask how long-lasting any such move will be. Partly because half the challenge in Pakistan is the back and forth between different experiments as elites try to strengthen themselves against their rivals. This tug of war means there is little stability in terms of the path ahead.
Perhaps what we need additionally at the moment is not just a discussion on the political reform needed but also a debate about what could create a consensus on the need for more devolution of power. What would push political parties to not just acknowledge but also accept the need for local governments or more provinces? Without this kind of a consensus, any such effort to devolve power will not be easy and if pushed through coercion, it will last as long as its creators enjoy power. Beyond that moment, anything is possible. Such formulas bring neither stability nor progress.

It also offered a forum where bilateral disputes and diverging viewpoints can be addressed and accommodated through a multilateral lens. For example, the Tianjin Declaration condemned the terrorist attacks targeting the Jaffar Express and in Khuzdar, along with the Pahalgam episode, signalling that condemnation of militancy should not be selective, and terrorism in all its forms should be shunned.
This is also a validation of Pakistan’s narrative, as this country has been denouncing the Pahalgam attack from the beginning, while also calling for hostile foreign actors to desist from supporting terrorist violence within its borders. It also suggests that certain states’ efforts to isolate Pakistan internationally have failed.
 
 

Additionally, the declaration called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while highlighting the “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the besieged Strip and denouncing the US-Israel aggression against Iran.
The fact is that any emerging multilateral order must be based on justice and international law. All those who violate these basic principles must be censured, unlike the present system, where perceived enemies face the full force of the law, as well as military aggression, while friends literally get away with murder. Israel’s ongoing genocide in the occupied territories is the most glaring example of this hypocrisy.
The West, primarily the US and its European/Nato allies, are highly suspicious of groupings such as the SCO and Brics, mainly because they challenge their entrenched hegemony on world affairs. Moreover, Western states are loath to see their ‘foes’ such as Vladimir Putin and Masoud Pezeshkian being accorded full protocol. They should remember that many of them treat Benjamin Netanyahu with even more reverence despite his criminal acts. Russia and China, which are currently leading the push towards a more multilateral global order, may not be perfect examples to emulate. But unlike the West, they are seen to support a more equitable world system, where the Global South has a voice.
Countries like Pakistan must take full advantage of the emerging regional and global formations. However, one set of global hegemons must not be replaced by another. Rather, a just new order is required where the social, economic and political rights of all states are respected. The future need not be one of confrontation between SCO/BRICS and the Western bloc, but of cooperation, where the path to progress has no strings attached.

• Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej surge to ‘exceptionally high’ levels through central Punjab, threaten province’s southern parts
• PDMA warns of urban flooding threat to Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat amid heavy rains
• Over 2.4m people and 600,000 animals displaced; 390 relief camps set up
• 41 deaths reported so far; rescue teams conducting ‘largest-ever operation’
LAHORE: Punjab remains in the grip of a worsening flood crisis, as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers surge to “exceptionally high” levels, threatening vast swathes of land, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned of more torrential rain, which could lead to urban flooding across Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.
The water level in the Punjab’s rivers is expected to rise further after the High Commission of India informed Pakistan of incoming floodwater from the Harike and Ferozepur headworks, according to the Pakistan Commission for Indus Water.
“Harike and Ferozpur along the Sutlej in India are at high flood level as of 8am on Sept 1, which will affect the water levels in the respective downstream districts,” says an advisory released by the PDMA.
Northern India, particularly in the catchment areas of rivers that flow into Pakistan, has been experiencing heavy and continuous rainfall in recent weeks. According to Indian forecasts, the next 36 hours will be critical in Uttrakhand, Himachal, Haryana, and Punjab, as there are chances of heavy rainfall in these areas.
As of 1am on Tuesday, the Chenab at Trimmu recorded a massive and steady outflow of 532,498 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood. A dangerous surge is moving towards Head Trimmu, and water levels are expected to swell to nearly 700,000 cusecs.
At the same time, the Ravi River is also at a “very high” flood level at Balloki Headworks with 144,675 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks is also in a similar state, recording 105,604 cusecs and rising.
The Sutlej River continues to pose a severe threat at Ganda Singh Wala, maintaining an “exceptionally high” flood with steady outflows of 253,068 cusecs. The situation is projected to worsen, with approximately one million cusecs of water expected to converge at Panjnad between Sept 4 and 5.
The provincial government, which has termed this its “largest rescue and relief operation,” is now shifting its focus south.
A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity told Dawn, “The water has passed the major central Punjab population centres, but the true test of our infrastructure and preparedness is now at Panjnad and the areas beyond. We are monitoring it on a minute-by-minute basis.”
On Monday, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that various cities were on high alert for the next 24 to 48 hours, including Jhang, Sahiwal, Toba Tek Singh, Okara, Multan, Pak­pattan, Bahawal­nagar, Vehari and Bahawalpur.
Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, she said the water released by India had created ‘extraordinary circumstances’. “To meet those circumstances, there were extraordinary preparations and readiness by Punjab’s authorities, rescue teams, and civil defence in times of emergency,” she added.
‘Punjab’s worst flood ever’
Addressing another press conference, PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia said 41 people have lost their lives in the floods, while eight have been injured.
He warned that Punjab is facing the biggest flood in its history, with the ninth spell of the monsoon predicted to bring more rain over the next two days.
He added that no new flood surge had entered Head Marala, but after the rains, the water in Leh Nullah at Katariyyan has reached up to 19 feet.
Mr Kathia said that there is no threat to Trimmu Headworks and noted that water from the Chenab would enter Multan within the next 12 hours, where it would merge with floodwaters from the Ravi.
He warned that a breach may have to be made at Safura on Monday night due to the major surge at Sidhnai, with arrangements already completed. He said the breach will affect 14 villages and 17,000 acres.
He added that a flood surge of 600,000 to 650,000 cusecs was expected at Head Muhammad Wala on Tuesday (today). An important meeting regarding Head Muhammad Wala had already been held in Multan and key decisions taken. If breaching occurs there, 16 revenue estates (mouzas) will be affected.
The PDMA chief predicted that floodwaters would accumulate at Panjnad on September 5, though at lower levels than earlier estimates. He said water from the Sutlej was currently moving towards Sulemanki and Head Islam.
He claimed that timely decisions had saved many lives. He said that Rescue 1122 was conducting the largest rescue operation in its history, with 3,100 villages and 2,900 revenue estates affected across Punjab.
So far, more than 2.4 million people have been affected, with over 900,000 people and 600,000 animals relocated to safe areas. Relief efforts include 390 camps and tent cities, while the Livestock Department is arranging fodder and feed for animals.
 
 

Mr Kathia also noted that India had only provided information regarding the Sutlej, with no details shared about any other river surges.
He further said that there is no longer any expectation of a major surge at Marala, however, rainwater will still come.
Earlier, Multan Com­missioner Aamir Karim Khan said over 450,267 people and 468,284 livestock had been relocated to safer places.
He said that a flood surge of nearly 800,000 cusecs in the Chenab was expected to pass through Multan between Monday and Tuesday night.
A decision regarding possible breaching at Sher Shah and Head Muhammad Wala would be made based on the water situation.
Urban flooding alert
Meanwhile, PDMA on Monday issued alert about urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat due to heavy rainfall expected in the next 72 hours.
According to an advisory, Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat may face urban flooding in the next 72 hours as parts of Punjab are set to receive rainfall.
 
 

“A well-marked monsoon low is present over southwest Haryana and adjoining areas, while a strong trough of a westerly wave lies over the northern parts of the country.”
It forecasted “widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall, along with torrential downpours, at scattered places over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Beas (upstream of Ganda Singh Wala), Ravi, and Chenab rivers, along with their tributaries and nullahs, as well as in Lahore and Gujranwala divisions, from Sept 1 to 3.”
In light of the situation, the PDMA warned of rising river flows, forecasting “very high” to “exceptionally high” floods in the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab. District authorities have been directed to take precautionary measures, prepare for urban flooding, and disseminate information among the public.

• Calls for building small dams, reservoirs, instead of mega projects
• Terms local govts essential for disaster management
• House to formally begin debate on floods today
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly’s new session on Monday began with an unusual display of unity as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed solidarity with flood victims, but this bonhomie proved short-lived as the opposition refused to attend a briefing by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Addressing a news conference outside Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the sitting, PTI leaders, including Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Asad Qaiser, announced they had decided not to attend the briefing on the orders of incarcerated party leader Imran Khan.
Proceedings continued only for an hour or so before Speaker Ayaz Sadiq cut short the sitting, announcing that the NDMA had arranged a briefing for some 100 MNAs at 6pm and asking members to attend it.
Earlier, the house suspended the normal agenda of the day and decided to initiate a full-fledged debate on the ongoing flood catastrophe that had caused massive devastation in the country’s northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides inundating a vast area of Punjab due to release of water by neighbouring India.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry moved a motion to begin a formal debate on “the situation arising out of the recent devastating floods in the country”.
‘Man-made disaster’
The highlight of the brief NA sitting was the speech of Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who termed the recent devastation caused by floods “a man-made disaster”.
The minister also called for local government elections in the country, besides stressing the need for building small dams and reservoirs to avert such tragedies in future.
“The catastrophe we are facing [today] cannot be called a natural disaster,” the minister declared.
“We have done value addition by constructing hotels and houses on waterways. We have encroached riverbeds,” he said, adding that this was the third or fourth such disaster in last 12 to 14 years.
Without naming anyone, he said when someone would be obliged to build a housing society on a riverbed, nature would react.
“In KP also, the people had encroached natural flow of rivers. What steps we have taken to remove encroachments on waterways after the country faced similar floods some three years back. He said they would face such tragedies again and again if they did not change their way.
Highlighting damages caused by floods in his home constituency, Mr Asif alleged a “contracting company” had destroyed his city of Sialkot.
“They are influential people and sitting in the Senate,” he said, pointing the finger at Zahir Khan and Bros (ZKB).
It was unfortunate that all big dams had been built by military dictators, while politicians had built hotels on riverbeds, he regretted.
He suggested building hundreds of small dams and reservoirs, instead of waiting for decades to build mega projects, warning that water would become an extremely scarce commodity in the future.
He was of the opinion that they needed to build small dams, which could be completed within a year or two.
“Do not do politics on it. We have political differences, but climate is a national, rather international issue, and it needs a national response,” he said.
LG system
“A comprehensive and robust local government system is needed to serve the masses in the cities, villages and tehsils,” said the minister amid desk-thumping by the members, regretting that presently there were no local body institutions in Punjab and other parts of the country.
The local bodies were essential for disaster management, he said, adding that power must be dispersed to towns, villages, tehsils and districts.
Earlier, Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI said the federal government should come forward to help KP people. He called for a detailed parliamentary discussion on water issues and the need for building new dams.
“The whole house should think over it as to how we can build dams and reservoirs. There should be no politics on the issue of dams,” the PTI leader said.
He asked the federal government to complete work on Mohmand Dam project that had been started by the PTI’s government.
He said political parties had failed to build even a single big water reservoir.
 
 

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan drew the attention of the house towards the flood devastations in his Buner constituency, stating that 240 people had died and another 120 were still missing.
He said the party had suspended its political activities in Punjab due to flood situation.
He praised the KP government and the armed forces for their role in the rescue efforts in the province.
He, however, termed the assistance so far provided by the federal government “insufficient”.
PPP’s Naveed Qamar urged collective national action against climate change and environmental mismanagement.
The PPP leader warned that floods could be 22pc more destructive next year, while in the long term, melting glaciers might dry up the Indus and other rivers, turning fertile lands into deserts and threatening centuries-old ecosystems.

• Putin urges shift from ‘Euro-centric’ security model
• Tianjin Declaration condemns terror attacks in Pakistan; reaffirms commitment to fight separatism and extremism
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pressed his vision for a new global security and economic order that prioritises the “Global South”, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to initiate a structured process to resolve longstanding disputes in South Asia.
“Global governance has reached a new crossroads,” said President Xi, adding that member states “must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practise true multilateralism” — a thinly veiled swipe at the US.
The summit brought together more than 20 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian PM Narendra Modi, in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.
In an image designed to convey a mood of solidarity, Putin and Modi were shown holding hands as they walked jovially towards Xi before the summit opened. The three men stood shoulder-to-shoulder, laughing and surrounded by interpreters.
“It’s hard to tell if the scene was choreographed or improvised, but it doesn’t really matter,” wrote Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
Putin, whose country has forged even closer economic and security ties with China amid the fallout from the Ukraine war, said the SCO had revived “genuine multilateralism”, with national currencies increasingly used in mutual settlements.
“This, in turn, lays the political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia,” Putin said.
“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others.”
Xi also called for the creation of a new SCO development bank, in what would be a major step towards the bloc’s long-held aspiration of developing an alternative payment system that circumvents the US dollar and the power of its sanctions.
Call for S. Asia dialogue
Addressing the 25th SCO Heads of States Council meeting, PM Shehbaz also made Pakistan’s case for normal and stable relations with its neighbours, advocating dialogue over confrontation.
“Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism,” he said, expressing disappointment over the region’s extremely disturbing development in the last few months.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s support for multilateralism, the prime minister said the SCO remained a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration.
On regional security, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, including what he termed “state terrorism,” while recalling the country’s immense sacrifices in the fight against extremism.
“We have lost over 90,000 lives and endured economic losses exceeding $152 billion — a sacrifice unparalleled in history,” he said, adding that foreign elements were involved in recent terror incidents in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms… Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interest must know that the world no longer buys this narrative. We had irrefutable evidence of the involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the PM remarked.
The prime minister also strongly condemned Israel’s unjustified aggression against Iran, a fellow SCO member, and called for an immediate end to the bloodshed in Gaza. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the two-state solution with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine.
He said Pakistan supports a peaceful and stable Afghanistan for the benefit of the entire region, expressing that hope that trilateral cooperation between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan would yield positive results. Addressing the challenge of climate-induced disasters, the prime minister spoke about the devastating floods currently affecting Pakistan due to torrential rains, which have caused massive human and economic losses. He thanked the international community, particularly China, for their solidarity and assistance.
Tianjin Declaration
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably stated: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025. Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes.
They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats,” the declaration said.
It added that the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It said that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.

• Endorses boycott of by-polls and resignation from parliamentary committees; daily walkouts planned in NA and Senate to highlight ‘lack of democracy’ in country
ISLAMABAD: Claiming that the international community has not shown interest in supporting Pakistan after floods, the parliamentary committee of the PTI on Monday urged former prime minister Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to help flood-hit people in Punjab and KP.
The committee endorsed the decision of Imran Khan to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees. It also decided to stage a daily boycott of the National Assembly to send a message to national and international community that the democracy does not exist in the country.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that during the meeting, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan briefed the committee on his meeting with party patron-in-chief Imran Khan, after which the committee endorsed the decision to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees.
“However, as international community has hardly shown any interest in supporting the flood victims, the committee decided to urge Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds for their support,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser further said that the overseas Pakistanis would be asked to transfer funds either to KP government or charity organisations of Imran Khan. The funds would be used to support flood victims in both Punjab and KP, he said.
“We fear that the crops will be ba­­dly affected due to floods, and next year there will be enormous pressure on the rupee as government will have to import food items including wheat and rice,” he warned. He said that the committee had decided to boycott the parliamentary sessions on a daily basis.
 
 

To another question, the PTI leader explaining the decision said that members of parliament would attend the sessions of the Senate and National Assembly and then walk out in protest.
He added that the country lacked the democracy, which was leading to continuous problems and growing security issues.
Rain hits Gandapur meeting
Meanwhile, PTI had arranged a meeting of media persons with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at KP House in Islamabad but heavy rain disrupted the event.
Strong winds dislodged the canopy set up in the lawn, forcing organisers to cancel the meeting. Media persons were later informed that the session could not be held.

• Senators seek clarity on energy supply, debt before privatisation
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee was informed on Monday that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited is expected to be privatised by November this year.
Briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation on the current status of the process, the Privatisation Commission secretary said that four companies were participating and would need to form consortiums with established airlines to operate PIA. Two applicants had already been disqualified for not meeting standards.
When Senator Zeeshan Khanzada raised concerns over PIA’s Rs650 billion debt, committee chairman Senator Dr Afnan Ullah Khan suggested that the airline’s two hotels could be sold to offset liabilities.
When Senator Khanzada questioned the government’s strategy of selling profitable companies in the first phase, the Privatisation Com­mis­sion secretary replied that investors are naturally more interested in profitable entities. Even if such companies were given away for free, he argued, it would still be the right decision as they may not remain profitable in the future.
The committee, chaired by Afnan Ullah Khan and attended by Senators Zeeshan Khanzada, Umer Farooq and Asad Qasim, also reviewed progress on other key privatisation initiatives, including power distribution companies (Discos), generation companies (Gencos), and Pakistan Minerals Development Corporation (PMDC).
 
 

The committee members stressed the need for clarity on energy supply agreements, debt restructuring and protection of profitable state assets before moving forward with privatisation.
Power Division officials informed the committee that Nandipur and Guddu power plants are on the privatisation list. “Eight important issues of Nandipur have been resolved, with only one pending related to the gas purchase and sale agreement,” they said, adding that the government was still deciding whether to provide a dedicated gas supply or continue with the current arrangement of supply on availability.
Regarding the Guddu power pla­nt, the officials said that four of nine outstanding issues had been resol­v­­ed, while disputes over land transfer re­­mained. The plant’s land is still re­­g­­istered under Wapda, though the latter has issued an NOC and the transfer process is underway.
Senator Afnan Ullah underlined the importance of resolving the energy supply issue for successful privatisation.

A statement from the police spokesperson said the action was taken after her complaint and video statement.
A case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The suspect had been stalking her for several days, the social media influencer said in the first information report.
She added that on Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.
Samiya thanked the Islamabad police in a subsequent video on her Instagram account and mentioned that the suspect had threatened her to take her complaint back.
Earlier in June, the Islamabad police said they had arrested the main suspect in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, a day after she was shot dead in her house.</p><small>2025-09-01 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012208588adcdac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938960/vaccines-dont-save-lives-vaccination-does-health-experts-shed-light-on-global-immunisation-trends' target='_blank'><strong>‘Vaccines don’t save lives. Vaccination does’: Health experts shed light on global immunisation trends</strong></a><br><p>With over one million children in Pakistan still missing routine vaccination, health experts on Monday gathered in Lahore for a week-long workshop focused on strengthening national immunisation efforts.
When it comes to vaccination, Pakistan continues to face challenges of low uptake, public hesitancy and mistrust, operational bottlenecks, and the unfinished struggle against the poliovirus.
The National Vaccinology Workshop kicked off today at Lahore’s Pearl-Continental Hotel and will run through till Friday.
The first day brought together leading experts who spoke on topics ranging from the history of vaccines and the science of how they work to global immunisation trends, coverage challenges, and Gavi’s support. Gavi is a public-private partnership formed in the year 2000 that aims to improve vaccine access in the world’s poorest countries.
Speakers on the first day included Prof Asad Ali, Dr Junaid Iqbal, Prof Farah Qamar, Dr Chaudhri Irtaza Ahmad, and Dr Richard Omore.
“What are the interventions modern medicine has done to save most lives?” Prof Ali began by asking the audience, before shortly answering himself: “Antibiotics and vaccines.”
Despite being a public health breakthrough, he noted, vaccines are costly to develop and produce because the safety threshold for administering them is set far higher than for most medicines, since they are typically given to healthy individuals.
“For years, access was largely limited to wealthy countries, until the launch of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation, through which international organisations pooled resources to support vaccine uptake worldwide,” he said.
Pakistan is currently Gavi’s largest recipient under its strategic phases 4.0 and 5.0, but experts warn that the country must begin preparing for life beyond donor support.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Dr Omore pointed to Kenya’s experience, where vaccine procurement faced transition challenges including critical vaccine stock shortages after the country crossed Gavi’s income threshold and lost support, forcing the government to quickly find its own funds.
He said Pakistan should use the current period of support to plan for a smooth transition so that immunisation programmes are not disrupted.
Dr Omore also stressed the importance of continued disease surveillance, noting that monitoring new strains and tracking vaccine impact, such as with human papillomavirus (HPV) or pneumococcal vaccines, is essential both for guiding health policy and for building public trust by showing evidence of reduced disease.
Earlier today, a poliovirus case was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district, taking the nationwide tally for this year to 24.
Last month, the World Health Organisation announced that it is partnering with the Pakistan government to train workers for the country’s first HPV vaccine drive. Experts have also urged advocacy for the said drive to ensure success.</p><small>2025-09-01 18:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012104272c67524.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938863/over-800-dead-as-60-magnitude-earthquake-hits-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Over 800 dead as 6.0-magnitude earthquake hits Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>A massive rescue operation was under way in Afghanistan on Monday, after a strong earthquake and multiple aftershocks flattened homes in a remote, mountainous region, killing more than 800 people, the Taliban authorities said.
The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Nangarhar and Kunar provinces border Pakistan, with the Torkham crossing, the site of many waves of Afghan returnees deported or forced to leave, often with no work and nowhere to go.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (2330 GMT on Sunday).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
 
 

Casualties and destruction swept across at least five provinces and rescuers were still pulling people from destroyed homes and evacuating the injured by helicopter as evening approached.
“The search operation is still going on. Many people are stuck under the rubble of their roofs,” the disaster management head in eastern Kunar province, Ehsanullah Ehsan, told AFP, warning the death toll could rise.
Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Another 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Afghanistan’s government-run Bakhtar News Agency reported citing officials from the Disaster Management Department in Kunar that “the most severely impacted districts include Noor Gul, Chawkay, Watapur, Mano Gai, and Chapa Dara”.
 






Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry earlier said.
The Taliban authorities and the United Nations mobilised rescue efforts to hard-hit areas. The defence ministry said 40 flight sorties had so far been carried out.
A member of the agricultural department in Kunar’s Nurgal district said people had rushed to clear blocked roads to isolated villages, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.
“There is a lot of fear and tension … Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad told AFP.
He said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.
“They wanted to build their homes here.”
In Wadir village in Kunar’s Nurgal district, dozens of residents of the surrounding area helped rescuers to pull people from the rubble of flattened homes, sometimes with their bare hands, AFP journalists saw.
Many injured were transported to hospitals in Jalalabad city, such as 22-year-old Zafar Khan Gojar, who was evacuated from Nurgal along with his brother, whose leg was broken.
“The rooms and walls collapsed … killing some children and injuring others,” he told AFP.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in Kunar “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Roads remained blocked nearly 20 hours after the earthquake, despite residents’ efforts to clear the way.
Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.
Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake that hit at a depth of 10km.
The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries.
Condolences
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed grief over the incident and extended his condolences.
“I stand in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he said.
Delegation of the European Union to Afghanistan posted on X: “The EU extends its heartfelt condolences to all affected by the recent devastating earthquake in Afghanistan’s Kunar & Nangarhar provinces. Our humanitarian partners are actively on the ground, providing critical aid to the victims. We stand in full solidarity with Afghans.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also extended condolences over the loss of life.
“Deeply saddened by the devastating earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, which shook Kabul & was also felt in various parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad. With reports confirming hundreds of precious human lives lost & villages destroyed, our hearts go out to the victims and their families. On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan, I extend my heartfelt condolences & prayers to the bereaved families,” he said on X.
He added, “We stand in solidarity with our Afghan brothers & sisters in this hour of grief, and we are ready to extend all possible support in this regard.”
 






In his condolence message, President Asif Ali Zardari also said that “during this hour of grief and hardship, Pakistan stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan.”
The statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said, “He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and for strength and resilience of the affected communities. He further prayed that the departed souls may rest in eternal peace and that the Almighty may grant courage to the bereaved families to bear this immense loss.”
In his statement, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar offered prayers for those injured and impacted by the quake.
 






The Foreign Office said he later called Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi to convey his condolences and assured readiness to extend all possible support as required by the Afghan side.
 






Following earlier reports of casualties, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he was “extremely saddened by the tragic loss of over 300 lives and the many injuries”.
“My deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones and heartfelt prayers for full and quick recovery of those injured. This immense sorrow is felt by us all,” he said on X.
 






KP Governor Karim Kundi also expressed grief over the “loss of hundreds of lives and large-scale financial damages caused by a powerful earthquake”.
In his condolence message, Kundi extended heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and prayed for the early recovery of the injured. He said the people of Pakistan stood in solidarity with the Afghan government and people during this difficult time.
Deadly quakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
In June 2022, a 5.9-magnitude quake struck the impoverished eastern border province of Paktika, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
Ravaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.
Since the return of the Taliban, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.
Funding cuts to Afghanistan obstruct earthquake response
Humanitarian officials said that the shrinking of funding for Afghanistan, led by US aid cuts, was hampering the response to the powerful earthquake, with dozens of clinics closed and a helicopter out of use.
The Taliban administration and aid officials have a daunting task to rescue and help thousands of Afghans with a tinier budget than ever and an economy in crisis.
“The actual delivery of response has been badly hit by the funding cuts this year, but also the number of people we have on the ground is much less than we would have had six months ago,” said Kate Carey, deputy head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan has been badly affected since President Donald Trump’s administration in January began funding cuts to its humanitarian arm and aid programmes worldwide in what he casts as part of a broader plan to remove wasteful spending.
But even before that, funding was shrinking to Afghanistan due to competing emergencies in areas such as Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, as well as frustration from donor governments over the Taliban’s policies towards women, especially its restrictions on the work of Afghan female NGO staff.
Humanitarian aid, aimed at bypassing political institutions to serve urgent needs, has shrunk to $767 million this year, down from $3.8 billion in 2022.
The impact of the cuts was starkly illustrated by the latest crisis, Carey said, with a creaking health system now dealing with thousands of patients hit by falling rubble.
Forty-four health clinics catering to over 363,000 people in Nangarhar and Kunar suspended operations or closed this year due to US aid cuts, according to World Health Organisation figures.
Where in the past a helicopter would have taken health teams and supplies to remote villages only accessible by foot, funding cuts to the World Food Programme, which runs a humanitarian air service, put the aircraft out of commission earlier this year, Carey said.
The Taliban has appealed for more aid in a country where half the population was already in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, according to UN estimates.
“Support from the international community is seen as essential,” said Abdul Rahman Habib, spokesperson for the Taliban-run Ministry of Economy, noting the fall in funds for food, healthcare, displaced people and communities hit by climate change.
Aid has been a lifeline during Afghanistan’s global isolation under the Taliban, whose government has only formally been recognised by Russia. Sanctions on some of its leaders have hampered the banking sector and the US has frozen billions in central bank assets.
Taliban authorities do not publicly release their annual budget. The World Bank noted in April that although authorities’ tax and revenue mobilisation had been relatively strong, it had not been enough to offset the sharp drop in aid.
As well as the global funding plunge, the UN and charities have to navigate a plethora of complex policies on operations under the Taliban, who say Afghan female aid staff should not work, though there are exemptions in health and education.
The Taliban, who have closed high schools and universities to female students and placed restrictions on their movement without a male guardian, say they respect women’s rights in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law.
Sherine Ibrahim, the International Rescue Committee’s Afghanistan Director, said today that the funding cuts were a drag on the response to Afghanistan’s latest disaster.
“Although we have been able to act fast, we are profoundly fearful for the additional strain that this disaster will have on the overall humanitarian response in Afghanistan,” she said.

The 10 families have been among more than 2,000 Afghans caught in limbo in Pakistan as Germany’s conservative-led government this year froze a programme to offer them sanctuary.
Most of them arrived in Hanover on a commercial flight from Istanbul around 2pm (1200 GMT), said an AFP reporter and the Airbridge Kabul initiative set up to help those affected.
An interior ministry spokeswoman confirmed that “45 Afghan nationals entered Germany. These are all individuals who obtained visas through legal proceedings … All of these individuals have fully completed the admission procedure and security screening“.
The Airbridge Kabul initiative later said that two more people had arrived after catching a later connection from Istanbul.
A mother and daughter who did not want to give their names told AFP they were looking forward to their new life in Germany.
“It feels very good and pleasant when girls can go to school, study, and I can also work, study, integrate into society, and learn the language,” the mother said.
“I am very happy that after many difficulties and challenges, we finally managed to reach a good life,” said the daughter, aged 20.
“I could have done many things, studied, achieved a position and reached the goals I had for myself, but unfortunately, I couldn’t. From now on, I will achieve them,” she said.
450 detained
After the Taliban returned to power in 2021, Germany set up a scheme to offer sanctuary to Afghans who had worked for German institutions or were otherwise deemed at high risk of persecution, including rights activists and journalists.
But the scheme was frozen under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who took office in May, as part of a wider crackdown on immigration.
While the Afghans have been left stranded in Pakistan, authorities have also stepped up a crackdown on Afghans living in the country without residency.
Last month, Berlin said around 450 Afghans waiting to come to Germany had been detained, and more than 200 of them were sent back to their Taliban-run homeland.
While alarm has grown about their fate, Germany has agreed to resume accepting some of the others.
The government said last week that Afghans for whom “courts have found that Germany is legally obliged to issue visas” would travel to Germany “in stages” once they had cleared security checks.
The 10 main applicants who arrived on Monday were eight women and two men who had been involved in “politics, the justice system and journalism”, said Eva Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Airbridge Kabul initiative.
Around 85 other stranded Afghans have begun legal proceedings against Germany, “and there are more every day”, Beyer said.</p><small>2025-09-01 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/012026338eee29c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938952/militant-attacks-surge-to-decade-high-in-august-says-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Militant attacks surge to decade-high in August, says think tank</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan witnessed an alarming spike in militant violence in August this year, registering a 74 per cent increase in militant attacks compared to July, becoming the “deadliest month in over a decade”, according to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on Monday.
In July, PICSS documented 82 militant attacks across the country, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries, a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June.
According to the think tank, those killed in July’s militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.
“With 143 militant attacks recorded, August became the deadliest month in over a decade, surpassing all monthly figures since February 2014, as per the PICSS Militancy Database,” the think tank’s latest report read.
The wave of violence left 194 people dead, including 73 security forces personnel, 62 civilians, 58 militants, and one pro-government peace committee member, according to PICSS.
Additionally, 231 others were injured, comprising 129 security personnel, 92 civilians, eight militants, and two peace committee members. Militants also abducted at least 10 individuals during the month.
“In response, security forces escalated their operations, killing at least 100 militants and arresting 31 others across the country. However, these actions also led to the deaths of three civilians and one security personnel,” according to PICSS.
When accounting for both militant attacks and security operations, at least 298 individuals lost their lives in August. These included 158 militants, 74 security forces personnel, 65 civilians, and one peace committee member.
The number of injured also rose to 250, with 137 security personnel, 100 civilians, 11 militants, and two peace committee members affected. PICSS observed a 100pc increase in security forces’ deaths and a 145pc rise in injuries compared to July. Militant fatalities rose by 27pc, while civilian deaths climbed 20pc.
The report highlighted that the most alarming escalation occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the tribal districts, which saw 51 militant attacks — a 200pc increase. These attacks resulted in 74 deaths, marking a 124pc rise.
The rest of KP was also similarly hit, with 55 attacks causing 56 deaths, including 26 security personnel, 22 civilians, and eight militants. In total, KP witnessed 106 militant attacks, the highest monthly figure in over 10 years, according to PICSS.
Operations were launched in Bajaur and North Waziristan, “resulting in partial clearance of militant hideouts, although the situation remains tense,” the think tank added.
Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, resulting in 52 deaths — 23 security personnel, 21 civilians, and eight militants. Another 45 people were wounded, including 23 security personnel and 22 civilians.
“Security forces eliminated 50 militants in the province — the highest number of militant deaths in operations since June 2015, when 60 were killed,” according to PICSS.
Sindh reported six attacks, leaving eight people dead — six civilians and two security personnel. Security forces arrested 11 suspected militants, all in Karachi.
In Punjab, two attacks occurred: a banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) assault in Dera Ghazi Khan, and an unsolved killing of a young cleric in Rawalpindi. resulting in the deaths of one civilian and one attacker.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, TTP-linked militants struck Chilas district, killing two security personnel and injuring one.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
The government labelled the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeking to improve counterterrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards.
Last week, the Balochistan government extended the enforcement of Section 144 across the province for another 15 days due to the prevailing law and order situation, according to an official notification from the additional chief secretary of the Home Department.
In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p><small>2025-09-01 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0120321436ad4b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938953/israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza-scholars-association-says' target='_blank'><strong>Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, scholars’ association says</strong></a><br><p>The world’s biggest academic association of genocide scholars has passed a resolution saying the legal criteria have been met to establish that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, its president said on Monday.
Eighty-six per cent of those who voted among the 500-member International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) backed the resolution declaring Israel’s “policies and actions in Gaza” had met the legal definition set out in Article II of the 1948 UN Convention on genocide.
Israel launched its devastating assault on the Gaza Strip in October 2023, after fighters from Hamas attacked Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages. Since then, Israel’s military action has killed 63,000 people, damaged or destroyed most buildings in the territory and forced nearly all its residents to flee their homes at least once.
 
 

A global hunger monitor relied on by the United Nations says parts of the territory are now suffering a man-made famine, which Israel also denies.
The three-page resolution calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population”.
It also states that the Hamas attack on Israel, which precipitated the fighting, constituted international crimes.
“This is a definitive statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on on the ground in Gaza is genocide,” the association’s president, Melanie O’Brien, a professor of international law at the University of Western Australia who specialises in genocide, told Reuters.
“There is no justification for the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, not even self-defence,” she added.
Israel’s foreign ministry called the statement disgraceful and “entirely based on Hamas’ campaign of lies”. Israel has in the past strongly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and claims they are justified as self-defence. It is fighting a case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that accuses it of genocide.
Convention adopted in wake of holocaust
The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, adopted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany, defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”. It requires all countries to act to prevent and stop genocide.
Since the genocide scholars’ association was founded in 1994, it has passed nine resolutions recognising historic or ongoing episodes as genocides.
The IAGS publishes a journal and holds regular international conferences of scholars studying genocide, and is considered the largest academic group in the field. Another group, the International Network of Genocide Scholars, also holds conferences and publishes a journal, but does not issue similar resolutions.
Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of the Gaza government media office, welcomed the resolution’s “prestigious scholarly stance”, which he said “places a legal and moral obligation on the international community to take urgent action to stop the crime, protect civilians, and hold the leaders of the occupation accountable”.
Sergey Vasiliev, a professor of international law at the Open University in the Netherlands who is not a member of the association, told Reuters the resolution showed that “this legal assessment has become mainstream within academia, particularly in the field of genocide studies”.
Several international rights groups and some Israeli NGOs have already accused Israel of committing genocide.
Last week, hundreds of UN staff at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk wrote to ask him to explicitly describe the Gaza conflict as an unfolding genocide, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.</p><small>2025-09-01 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01183932cf62e97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938949/sco-summit-adopts-joint-declaration-condemning-jaffar-khuzdar-pahalgam-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>SCO summit adopts joint declaration condemning Jaffar, Khuzdar, Pahalgam attacks</strong></a><br><p>The leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Monday adopted a statement condemning terrorism in Pakistan and India amid tense ties between the two nations that have seen allegations against each other for alleged involvement in militant attacks.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On April 22, assailants conducted an attack in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000.
In all three scenarios, both countries accused the other of having a role in the incident. The SCO defence ministers summit in June had failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal. According to The Times of India, New Delhi had refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran.
The SCO summit of leaders is currently underway in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin. China’s President Xi Jinping hosted the two-day summit of SCO leaders as well as “SCO plus”, bringing together some 20 heads of state and government, besides leaders of international organisations. It was the largest gathering of the SCO as well as the fifth time hosted by China since the bloc was formed in 2001.
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably said: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 2025.
“Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes. They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.”
The declaration said the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It added that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.
They also signed the Agreement on the Universal Centre for Countering Challenges and Threats to the Security of SCO Member States and the Agreement on the SCO Anti-Drug Centre.
The member states also noted the proposal to establish a Centre for Strategic Studies in the field of security.
The declaration said the SCO members would continue to actively implement the Programme of Cooperation of SCO Member States in Countering Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism for 2025-2027.
“The member states strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stress that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and call on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists, with the central role of the United Nations, by fully implementing the relevant UN Security Council resolution and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in accordance with the UN Charter and the principles of international law, in order to jointly combat all terrorist organisations. They stress the importance of adopting by consensus a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.”
The leaders further adopted 24 documents to strengthen cooperation in security, economy and cultural exchanges.
They also adopted a 10-year SCO Development Strategy until 2035, which “defines the priority tasks and main directions for deepening multifaceted cooperation in the interests of ensuring peace and stability, development and prosperity in the SCO space”, read the joint statement.
Amid the US tariffs, which have roiled international markets, the SCO leaders expressed support for the multilateral trading system.
They also marked the 80th anniversary of World War II victory and of the founding of the UN, the declaration added.
‘SCO Partner’
The SCO also evolved from the “Shanghai Five” mechanism comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before Uzbekistan joined as the sixth member. Today, it included 10 member states, two observers and 14 dialogue partners across Asia, Europe and Africa.
The organisation covers approximately 24 per cent of global land area and 42pc of the world’s population, with member states accounting for roughly one-quarter of global GDP and trade increasing nearly 100-fold in two decades.
China’s trade with SCO members, observers and dialogue partners reached a record $890 billion in 2024, or 14.4pc of its total foreign trade.
At the Tianjin summit, the SCO member states decided to combine the statuses of “observer” and “dialogue partner” into a single status of “SCO Partner”.
Laos was accepted as a new “SCO Partner” at the Tianjin summit.
While the previous SCO leaders’ summit was held in Kazakhstan in July 2024, which saw 25 strategic documents — covering energy, security, finance and information security — adopted, China will pass on the SCO chairmanship to Kyrgyzstan and the next summit will be held under the slogan “25 years of the SCO: together towards sustainable peace, development and prosperity”.
Situation in Middle East and Afghanistan
Regarding the situation in the Middle East, the SCO leaders reiterated their deep concern over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and strongly condemned actions that led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Gaza Strip.
They stressed the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region.
“Member states note that the only possible way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is through a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question,” the declaration said.
It added that they also strongly condemned the military strikes by Israel and the United States against Iran in June, saying that such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, were a “gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement on the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran” that undermined regional and international security with serious implications for global peace and stability.
“They noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm. In this regard, they reaffirmed their commitment to diplomatic initiatives aimed at the peaceful resolution of the issues that have arisen.
“Member states reaffirmed the importance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), emphasising that it is binding and must be implemented in full in accordance with its provisions, and consider that any attempts to interpret it arbitrarily undermine the authority of the UN Security Council.
“They called for the resumption of constructive dialogue between the parties involved and for a focus on jointly seeking solutions that would prevent further escalation of the situation,” the declaration said regarding Iran and its stalemate on nuclear talks.
On Afghanistan, the SCO members reaffirmed their commitment to the country’s establishment as an independent, neutral and peaceful state, free from terrorism, war and drugs, and expressed their readiness to support the efforts of the international community to ensure peace and development in the country.
“Member states reiterated that the formation of an inclusive government with broad participation of representatives of all ethno-political groups of Afghan society is the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the country,” the declaration said.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0119013783e4c23.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938946/trump-says-india-offered-to-reduce-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-nothing' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India offered to reduce tariffs on US goods to nothing</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on US goods to zero amid deteriorating ties between the two countries.
While calling the US’s relationship with India “one-sided”, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “They have now offered to cut their tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago.”
The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to Trump’s comments, which follow the implementation of total duties as high as 50 per cent on Indian goods.
 


Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50pc levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect last week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The latest tariff salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewellery have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.</p><small>2025-09-01 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01144709a0f1031.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938882/pm-shehbaz-raises-indus-waters-treaty-issue-at-sco-calls-for-dialogue-on-all-outstanding-disputes' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz raises Indus Waters Treaty issue at SCO, calls for dialogue on all outstanding disputes</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday raised the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) issue at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) summit in China and called for a “structural” dialogue on all outstanding disputes.
PM Shehbaz arrived in China on Saturday to attend the SCO Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit held from August 31 to September 1. Besides Pakistan, the SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
“We respect all international and bilateral treaties and expect similar principles to be followed by all SCO members,” PM Shehbaz said at the summit today, in an apparent reference to fellow SCO member India and its unilateral move to hold the IWT in abeyance in April.
“Uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties among SCO members will strengthen the SCO working smoothly and will support the achievement of broader goals for which the SCO was established,” he stressed at the summit in China’s Tianjin.
 
 

India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
Earlier this month, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz called for a “comprehensive and structural dialogue to discuss all outstanding disputes”, adding: “I will request your consideration to lead this dialogue under your sagacious leadership so that they can have its dividends as early as possible.”
The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan sought a “normal and stable relationship with all its neighbours”. “It seeks dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz noted: “Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism. And yet, to our shock and deep disappointment, the region witnessed extremely disturbing developments during the last few months.
“Pakistan supports and respects the sovereignty and integrity of all SCO members and its neighbours,” he added.
 


“We will continue our efforts, along with all SCO members and the chairman of SCO, to promote progress and prosperity in the entire region and to ensure lasting peace in South Asia,” PM Shehbaz pledged.
“Pakistan has always abided by the UN and SCO charters and will always respect the principles that will hold dear to all of us for our collective good. As a peace-loving nation, Pakistan has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy, consultation over confrontation,” he reiterated.
During his address, the premier also highlighted the severe floods that Pakistan was once again facing.
“My country is once again passing through unprecedented torrential rains, cloudbursts and massive devastation due to consequent flooding in three of our major rivers,” PM Shehbaz said, highlighting huge loss of lives and livestock, as well as severe damage to infrastructure and crops.
 
 

“We deeply appreciate the international community’s, including China’s, solidarity, sympathy and support with us,” he said, hailing the rescue and rebuilding efforts of “my brave and resilient people”.
At the outset of his speech, the prime minister noted that the port city of Tianjin, where the summit is taking place, represented “China’s core values as a connector and bridge of cultures and civilisation”.
He thanked President Xi and his government for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the SCO gathering. The premier also extended his felicitations to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on their national days today and yesterday, respectively.
PM Shehbaz further said: “For us, the SCO is a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration. China’s successful tenure as chair of the SCO is reflective of President Xi’s sagacious and visionary leadership.”
He stressed that China’s “global leadership” was exemplified not only through the bloc but also in landmark initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
‘Irrefutable evidence of foreign hands in terrorism on Pakistani soil’
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz also highlighted the issue of terrorism and said Pakistan had “irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands” in the Jaffar Express hijacking in March.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of at least 26 passengers, including 18 security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.
“We have irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident, as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and KP provinces of Pakistan,” the premier said at the summit.
“Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interests must know that the world no longer buys this fictitious narrative.”
 
 

Days after the hijacking, the military spokesperson had said India was the main sponsor “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan and others before”. In April, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations had also said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.
At the SCO summit, the prime minister noted: “The menace of terrorism, separatism, [and] extremism continues to pose a grave threat to Pakistan and endanger peace and security of the entire SCO region and the SCO family.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with the fullest force at our command, including state terrorism in clear and ambiguous terms,” he added.
Recalling the country’s “great sacrifices in combating terrorism not only for its own self but for the region and far beyond”, PM Shehbaz reiterated that Pakistan had lost over 90,000 valuable lives and endured economic losses of over $152 billion.
“A sacrifice which has no parallel in history,” the premier said, adding that there “cannot be a bigger manifestation of our unwavering commitment to defeat terrorism with the cooperation of all SCO members and global powers around the globe”.
Afghanistan and regional connectivity
The prime minister also voiced Pakistan’s desire for a “peaceful and stable” Afghanistan, noting that it was not only in Islamabad’s interest but that of the entire region.
“While we remain engaged in building our ties with the Afghan leadership to leverage them as economic partners and good neighbours, we hope that this cooperation with Afghanistan and our trilateral meetings between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan will have positive results in times to come,” Shehbaz said.
 
 

“As SCO leaders, we have reaffirmed year after year the significance of enhanced regional connectivity. This requires efficient land, air and rail transport corridors to ensure the reliability of supply chains,” he stressed.
The premier asserted that the expansion of CPEC could serve as a “practical demonstration of SCO’s vision for regional connectivity and economic integration”.
‘Heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza’
During his address, PM Shehbaz also condemned Israel’s deadly attacks on Iran in June this year and its “heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza”.
“Israel’s unjustified aggression against our fellow brotherly member country Iran, a fellow SCO state, is condemnable and therefore unacceptable,” the prime minister said.
 
 

“The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is a festering wound on our collective conscience. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to gruesome violence and heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza,” the premier said.
He underscored that Pakistan has consistently supported the UN-mandated two-state solution, which meant the creation of an independent state of Palestine with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Meetings with SCO leaders
PM Shehbaz also held meetings with fellow SCO leaders on the summit’s sidelines.
 






Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condoled the prime minister on the ongoing floods in Pakistan and expressed his country’s support.
 






The two also reviewed the state of cooperation across diverse sectors and expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum in bilateral relations.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to NIH, the latest case was detected in a 20-month-old infant in the southern KP’s Tank district, taking the province’s total tally to 16. Fifteen of them have been detected in southern KP, according to the NIH.
Last week, the KP government launched a polio immunisation campaign, with emphasis on the south of the province, where polio teams faced the most resistance.
The latest case has taken the total cases recorded in 2025 to 24, according to NIH — including 16 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Noting the prevalence of polio in the south of KP, the NIH said, “A comprehensive strategic Roadmap for Polio eradication in Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been developed and finalised.
“The plan incorporates microplanning innovations, gap analyses, and targeted strategies and interventions to address persistent challenges,” it added.
To deal with growing cases in the region, NIH stated that a campaign will be carried out in the south of the province — set to run from September 15 to 18.
Part of an immunisation campaign announced last week, the three-day drive aims to target Bannu, Bajaur and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
In its statement, the NIH appealed to parents to cooperate with polio teams and complete their child’s immunisation course.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-01 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/011108231e00b7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938881/crew-of-5-dead-as-army-helicopter-crashes-in-gbs-chilas-due-to-technical-fault-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Crew of 5 dead as army helicopter crashes in GB’s Chilas due to ‘technical fault’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A crew of five died on Monday after an army helicopter crashed in Diamer District’s Chilas town in Gilgit-Baltistan after developing a “technical fault”, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
“On 1 Sep 25, at around 1000 hours, an MI-17 helicopter crash landed near Hudor village, approximately 12 kilometres away from Thakdas Cantonment,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement. “The helicopter was on routine training flying when it developed a technical fault and crashed.”
It added that all crew members on board were martyred as a result of the crash.
The crew members were identified as Major Atif, who was the pilot in command, Major Faisal, the co-pilot, flight engineer Naib Subedar Maqbool, and crew chiefs Havaldar Jahangir and Naik Amir, according to the ISPR.
Earlier, Diamer Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, in a statement, had confirmed the incident, saying that the helicopter was conducting a test landing on a newly proposed helipad when it crashed.
He said that the Diamer police and rescue teams had reached the incident site to start the evacuation.
Separately, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in a statement, said he had issued directions to impose an emergency at Chilas Hospital and ordered the immediate availability of medical staff.
He also expressed his condolences and paid tribute to the martyred personnel. “The sacrifice of the martyrs of the helicopter crash is a source of pride for the nation,” he said.
Earlier this month, a rescue helicopter crashed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, killing two pilots and three crew members. The helicopter was dispatched with supplies following flash flooding in the region.
In 2024, at least six people died and eight others were critically injured after a helicopter of a petroleum company crashed near the Shewa oil field in North Waziristan.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:01</small></div><hr>
