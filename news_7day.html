<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231008587ed73ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950759/age-love-and-perseverance-asif-afridis-story' target='_blank'><strong>Age, love and perseverance: Asif Afridi’s story</strong></a><br><p>People say “age is just a number” when they want to feel young again. But in truth, age tells a story — of perseverance, growth, and dreams pursued against time itself.
In Asif Afridi’s case, age represents the power to dream and the perseverance to achieve. It reflects the richness of skill and the mental fortitude of a 38-year-old Test debutant. Above all, it represents love — and how it drives him.
Love has driven Asif all his life. His love for cricket took him from team to team, city to city, in pursuit of a permanent place in either. It kept him going through the toil and hardship of Pakistan’s domestic circuit for no less than 16 years.
Now, as he finally made his Test debut for Pakistan in the second match against South Africa, love again inspired him.
Asif is father to four boys and a little girl — and unapologetically, he loves the girl the most. She is battling cerebral palsy in a hospital while Asif plays the Test, having already taken six wickets on debut.
But he wants to win it for his girl.
“I am worried for her but at the same time happy about my performance here,” he said on Wednesday.
“My wife is extending support and giving me hope during this time. I’m praying we win this match so that I can dedicate it to my daughter. I love her more than my boys.”
Just as Asif can bowl on a nagging line and length for hours — a skill he showcased in Rawalpindi — his love for his daughter is equally steadfast, something well known among his colleagues in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata cricket fraternity.
“What’s most special about him? It’s how he loves and takes care of his daughter,” Abdul Rehman, a renowned coach from Peshawar, told Dawn.com.
Describing Asif further, Rehman called him a “calm and cool” person — a temperament that has shaped his game.
“He’s humble, hardworking, and a master of his craft,” Rehman said. “His understanding of the game, the conditions, and the batter he’s bowling to has always been immaculate.”
That understanding was on full display during South Africa’s first innings in Rawalpindi, as Asif kept landing the ball right on target. He hardly missed the stumps and began reaping rewards late on the second day — trapping Tony de Zorzi lbw before producing a peach of a delivery to dismiss Dewald Brevis.
On the third day, he added four more wickets, even as South Africa fought back through Senuran Muthusamy and Kagiso Rabada, inching closer to a series-levelling win.
“All I wished coming into the Test match was to live up to my reputation in domestic cricket — someone who bowls a nagging line and length, whether I take wickets or not,” Asif told reporters.

“I wanted people to recognise me as a quality bowler. Thank God I did more than I wished for.”

Asif’s journey to this point hasn’t been straightforward. His domestic career suffered a major setback in 2023 when he was banned for a year for an anti-corruption offence — later determined to be an honest mistake. Yet he didn’t let it derail his focus, taking 27 wickets in the 2024 season.
Earlier this year, he led Fata to promotion to the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy — Pakistan’s premier first-class competition — claiming 33 wickets in just five matches in the Hanif Mohammad Trophy, a Grade II event.
For Asif, those performances came from a simple desire — to bow out of the game with his head held high.
“…if we hadn’t returned to first-class cricket that year, it would have been very difficult later,” he said.
“So I worked hard and bowled long spells. I always hoped, God willing, that whenever I play, wherever I play, I’ll perform in such a way that people say my career ended on a strong note.”
Little did Asif know that before hanging up his boots, he would wear the Pakistan Test cap. And when that moment finally arrived, it brought sheer happiness.
“When the captain informed me on the eve of the match that I’d be making my debut, believe me, I couldn’t sleep all night,” he said. “I was very happy — and so was my family.”
When Pakistan’s mainstays, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, walk to the crease this morning with a slender lead of 23, they will also be playing for Asif and his daughter.
And if Pakistan go on to win, it won’t just be a victory for the team — it will be a triumph of love, patience, and a father’s promise to his little girl.</p><small>2025-10-23 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950711/the-hard-state-approach' target='_blank'><strong>The ‘hard state’ approach</strong></a><br><p>AS the administration expands its dragnet around the TLP, there is once again talk in official circles of applying the ‘hard state’ approach to tackling extremism. It is clear that after the TLP’s latest gambit failed — marching on Islamabad in supposed solidarity with Gaza — and resulted in deadly showdowns with the law, the state is giving no quarter to the hard-line outfit.
In the latest developments, along with mulling a ban on the party, the Punjab government says around 3,800 financiers of the TLP have been identified. The federal interior minister, while on a visit to Karachi on Tuesday, also said that armed groups would not be tolerated.
However, meeting with senior Barelvi clerics in the city, the minister assured them that the crackdown was not targeted at any particular sect. When Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was asked about the ban on TV, he did not confirm the decision. Yet he reiterated that Pakistan must act as a “hard state” to crack down on extremism.
 
 

The TLP’s tactics over its decade-long existence have been largely indefensible, as it has resorted to the use of violent agitation as an organisational tool, taking on the state at multiple junctures. Moreover, its campaigns of targeting minority groups have borne deadly results. In fact, it can be asked what took the state so long to notice its illegal, violent activities.
Yet it is also true that in the guise of fighting extremism, the state must not crack down on all opposition, and trample on civil liberties. This is all the more important when some representatives of the state use overly broad definitions of extremism, and lump together political opponents with bloodthirsty militants and hatemongers.
There is genuine concern that in their excitement to build a ‘hard state’, the rulers may further smother fundamental rights, while justifying crackdowns on opposition parties, going after dissenting journalists and restricting peaceful protests — all in the name of fighting ‘extremism’. While violent groups must be put out of business, constitutional safeguards need to be upheld, and civil liberties protected.
As this paper has stated, instead of banning groups, the best way to proceed against outfits such as the TLP would be to prosecute them under relevant sections of the law, for example, those that deal with inciting violence and promoting hate speech. Sadly, proponents of the hard state overlook the root problems that have fuelled militancy in the country. In those parts of Pakistan that have been hardest hit by terrorist activity — KP and Balochistan — poverty, injustice and underdevelopment have helped militant groups increase their ranks.
Therefore, while those who promote violence must be prosecuted, the state’s long-term goal should be to promise justice, inclusivity and prosperity across the country, particularly in its deprived areas.

The incident took place near Api village where a car, carrying six inmates, was attacked by unknown assailants. As a result, all the inmates died on the spot. Sources said that after the tragic incident, the attackers poured petrol on the vehicle and set it on fire, which badly burnt the bodies.
District police officer Waqar Ahmed confirmed the incident, saying that the suspects managed to escape after the attack, while the bodies were shifted to Mirali Hospital for identification.
Identity of the deceased has not been ascertained as yet, he said.
Sources said motive behind the attack could not be known. However, they added that the deceased were reportedly members of a local peace committee. 
The police and security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the attackers.

This rapid assessment serves as the foundation for the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment 2025, following the precedent set by the comprehensive PDNA 2022 that guided Pakistan’s Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Framework (4RF). Can the current assessment provide the vision, direction, and granular data needed to ensure that PDNA 2025 translates lessons learned into effective climate adaptation and disaster resilience measures?
The 2025 floods provide a crucial, if tragic, opportunity to assess whether the climate-focused recommendations from 2022 influenced reconstruction and preparedness, or whether they merely exposed gaps between Pakistan’s development partners’ engagement ambitions and the government’s implementation realities. Three questions follow the Preliminary Assessment: What methodology was employed to capture the scientific complexity of floods across diverse ecosystems? How does the assessment build upon existing national and international climate commitments? What lessons were learned from the 2022 floods, and does the 2025 assessment show their application?
 
 

Methodology: The preliminary assessment lacks any scientific methodology. Rather than systematic data collection, it consists of an ad hoc compilation of datasets received from various departments in response to federal agency requests. The resulting data is neither complete nor verifiable. Critical gaps include the absence of district-level severity rankings and gender-disaggregated data. The assessment thus presents a fragmented, province-level, top-down picture lacking the methodological coherence needed for recovery planning.
Climate integration: Beyond some fleeting, rhetorical references noting that Pakistan ranks among the most vulnerable countries while contributing less than one per cent of emissions, the assessment is silent on climate readiness preparations. There are no references to climate adaptation or mitigation, Paris Agreement commitments, or national climate policies including the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) or NDCs. It even fails to mention the climate change ministry; neither has it referred to the findings and recommendations of the 2022 PDNA or 4RF. Does this mean that those who compiled the current report did not use the prior, climate-focused assessment as a benchmark for measuring progress?

Does the 2025 assessment show the application of lessons learned from the 2022 floods?

PDNA 2022 lessons: PDNA 2022 and the accompanying 4RF reframed our vulnerability, positioning recovery not as mere reconstruction, but as an existential imperative to embed climate resilience into national development planning through nature-based adaptation rather than traditional engineering. The diagnosis was robust; the prescription was not as it didn’t specify the institutional mechanisms and operational frameworks needed, leaving implementation priorities to the government.
 
 

Proposed policy reforms: The 2022 PDNA’s policy recommendations centred on three priorities. Institutionally, it advocated embedding risk assessments into the Planning Commission’s project approval processes and strengthening district-level disaster management capacity. Strategically, it called for aligning recovery with Pakistan’s climate commitments, while operationalising existing disaster management and flood protection plans. Operationally, it emphasised enforcing climate-resilient building codes in flood-prone areas, establishing comprehensive disaster risk financing strategies including sovereign insurance, and creating shock-responsive social protection systems.
Proposed programmatic interventions: These prioritised housing reconstruction with subsidies for climate-resilient core units. Infrastructure was to be rebuilt to multi-hazard standards emphasising nature-based solutions. Social assistance included cash-for-work schemes. Finally, the farm sector required weather-based agricultural insurance systems.
A critical gap spanned both policy and programmatic recommendations. The 2022 PDNA outlined what should be done but provided limited guidance on how. While this preserved sovereignty in priority-setting, it also created implementation vacuums that became evident in the 2025 floods.
Conclusion: The 2025 floods provide clear preliminary evidence of significant implementation gaps in the 2022 climate mandate. The persistent re-destruction of infrastructure (for example, the M-5 motorway section) and the loss of over 8,400 houses, confirms ‘build back better’ principles were not operationalised. Local capacity remains weak, with District Disaster Management Authorities still under-resourced. Pakistan has again requested support from the World Bank, ADB, EU, and UNDP for a post-disaster needs assessment. With this process ongoing, systematic evaluation of climate considerations in 2025 recovery planning remains pending.
PDNA 2022 exhibited strong conceptual understanding of climate vulnerability — acknowledging attribution science, invoking ‘build back better’ principles, and recommending nature-based solutions and climate-resilient reconstruction aligned with international best practices. Yet three weaknesses undermined implementation. First, the PDNA stresses principles over operational specificity, recommending climate resilience without detailing enforcement mechanisms, institutional mandates, or compliance frameworks. Second, it failed to systematically link recommendations to our existing climate policy architecture — the climate change policy, NAP, and NDC — forgoing opportunities to leverage these frameworks for implementation and financing. Third, it proposed no institutional reforms or policy actions necessary to embed climate screening into routine development planning, particularly the Planning Commission’s project approval processes.
By 2025, these weaknesses produced predictable failures. Environmental and climate risk screening remained absent from major infrastructure. Resilient construction standards went unenforced. District capacity-building never materialised. Adaptive social protection systems were never established. The gap between 2022’s climate ambitions and 2025’s reality exposes fundamental implementation barriers in Pakistan’s disaster response system.
The 2022-2025 experience proves that merely acknowledging climate drivers differs fundamentally from implementing effective policy. Assessments alone can’t drive transformation; they require strong institutional enforcement mechanisms, reform champions, and political will that prioritise long-term resilience over quick, short-term reconstruction. The 2025 floods resulted not from insufficient knowledge, but from unreformed political and institutional systems. Without operational frameworks to translate analysis into action, communities will remain vulnerable to predictable, recurring climate impacts.

Since the last week of September, police have registered five such cases but are reportedly reluctant to register another one that occurred recently, sources told Dawn.
A victim of such an incident visited the Khanna police station twice to register her case, but the police gave her a cold shoulder and made ‘lame excuses’.
Talking to Dawn, Mohammad Umer Saeed, son of the alleged victim, said his mother along with his sister, was waiting for a passenger vehicle on the Islamabad Expressway on Sunday when a car carrying three women stopped and called for passengers going to Gujar Khan. His mother and sister boarded the vehicle.
After some time, the passengers inside the vehicle snatched a purse from the victim.
When she raised an alarm, the suspects pushed her and her daughter out of the moving vehicle near Khanna and escaped. The purse contained a mobile phone and Rs2,000 in cash, he said.
Following the incident, the victim and her daughter went to the Khanna Police Station, but the “police ignored them, pretending to be busy”.
They waited for the duty officer to listen to their complaint, but no one paid attention, the citizen said. After some time, the duty officer left the police station without hearing her case, forcing her to return to her hometown, Gujar Khan.
The next day (Monday), she returned to the police station with her son and submitted a written complaint to the duty officer. The officer took her to the station clerk (moharrar), who told her that the duty officer on duty the previous day was on leave and that the matter was his responsibility. The clerk accepted her complaint but did not provide any receipt, complaint number, or e-tag and asked her to return later.
Since then, no one from the police station has contacted the family to inquire about the incident or inform them about any legal action.
Sources in the police said that since September 26, the capital police have registered five such cases. One case each was registered at the Secretariat and Tarnol police stations, where culprits looted Rs140,000 and Rs100,000 respectively.
In October, similar cases were reported at the Industrial Area, Secretariat and Khanna police stations, in which culprits looted Rs40,000, Rs80,000 and Rs300,000 respectively. The sources said that the gangs involved in these crimes operate with two distinct modus operandi. One group uses private cars to offer rides to people, while the other pretends to operate passenger vehicles.
The latter group also includes female accomplices who participate in the crimes and help lure victims. The gangs usually target people waiting at bus stops and pick them up under the pretext of taking them to their destinations before snatching their cash and valuables.

These measures stabilised the economy by choking all growth, the same tried and tested formula Pakistan has been using since 1988.
But the problem has always been the same: how to restart growth after stabilisation in a way that does not lead to a resurgence of the same deficits all over again. That has been the bane of Pakistan’s economy for too many decades now, booms followed by busts.
In the past, they always managed to get some sort of a bonanza from abroad to finance their growth. These inflows included borrowed money via the Foreign Currency Deposit Scheme in the 1990s, or the post 9/11 bonanza enjoyed by Musharraf, or the generous inflows from China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the middle of the 2010s, or the post Covid inflows and debt restructuring coupled with the temporary halt of the IMF programme in the period 2020 to 2022.
The few times we had adjustment without ensuing growth saw the country come to unendurable stagnation. Two examples would be the aftermath of the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement implementation (though 9/11 came along and changed everything) and the post Great Financial Crisis period following 2008.
 
 

The path from stagnation to growth was marked, in each case, with the same set of indicators moving in the same direction every time. First came the nascent signs of growth in the Large Scale Manufacturing Index. This was followed by rising import payments. Eventually, the import growth swamped exports, and the current account, which had been stabilised with much pain and sacrifice, returned to deficit. Then the deficits began to grow and the foreign currency reserves, which had peaked, began their downward slide. From there, things became unstoppable, because growth (of this sort) once begun, is very difficult to stop for any government.

The problem is how to restart growth after stabilisation in a way that does not lead to a resurgence of the same deficits all over again.

The government tries to shore up reserves with borrowed money, and once that effort runs its course, the reserves begin to fall. Once the fall gathers momentum the need to adjust the exchange rate rises and the government resists. Eventually, they are reduced to selling reserve dollars in the market in order to shore up the exchange rate, thereby accelerating the decline. Once reserves fall below certain thresholds it becomes necessary to adjust the exchange rate, and because they do it in one go, and at the last minute, the adjustment is traumatic and large.
Thus begins the eternal return to the IMF. Every government succeeds in putting this moment off long enough till they are no longer in power. And they all make the same argument: ‘while we were in power, the economy grew. It’s when the other guys came that everything started to go wrong.’
This is worth remembering and bearing in mind when looking at Pakistan today, because the same story is repeating itself all over again. Having hit ‘peak stability’ earlier this year, the government has been stuck in a low growth, low inflation equilibrium ever since. They cannot move forward towards growth. They cannot stay standing in this place for long either.
Estimates of the number of new entrants to Pakistan’s labour force range as high as two million every year. If the economy is not creating 2m new jobs every year, then unemployment rises. Some of these new entrants find income-generating opportunities through creating new businesses of their own in our time, but these businesses are almost always in the services sector, and don’t create enough value to be the bedrock of job creation on the scale that is required for a country the size of Pakistan.
As unemployment rises so does the number of people living below the poverty line. And those urban middle class folks who saw their incomes devastated during the period of the inflationary spiral find life turning into endless drudgery as their household incomes remain insufficient to meet even middle class life requirements.
This cumulative build-up of misery across society is channelled upward via any institution that taps the voice of the people at scale, such as political parties, mass and social media. The government of the day finds itself struggling to message out its accomplishments, which appear to the people like superficial vanities. Thus is born the desperation to pump growth, the first requirement for which is dollars.
This was the story every time since at least 1998. Musharraf entered claiming he inherited a bankrupt economy and had to make difficult decisions to stabilise it. But he left a bankrupt economy in 2008, while claiming the economy grew while he was in power and crashed only when the others entered office instead. The PPP government claimed it inherited a bankrupt economy, as did Nawaz Sharif in 2013 and Imran Khan in 2018. Each left a bankrupt economy too, but they claimed things were going well while they were in power (except for the PPP which could not even mount that claim since it never got the chance to pump growth as there never was much of a bailout for them beyond the IMF).
Now one more time the story is repeating itself, though we are in the early stages of the curve. The stabilisation part is done. The growth is yet to come. But even the small, incipient growth that the economy has registered in the past few months has caused import payments to rise and put pressure on the foreign exchange markets. The government is more unpopular than any in recent memory. And they are hungering for some sort of breakout. Whether or not it comes, it is worth remembering this tale always has the same ending.

PM Shehbaz visited Egypt last week to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. Among his many engagements with world leaders, the premier had also met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
 






Fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan noted that posts from multiple users on social media platform X, particularly PTI supporters, since October 13, had shared a low quality and blurry image of the meeting with the Armenian premier , claiming it showed PM Shehbaz and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the Middle East Summit in Egypt. This was despite Netanyahu not even attending the event.
Gulzar had also shared the image with the same claim in a now-deleted post with the following caption: “Article 6! Treason! Pakistan does not recognise Israel let alone a genocidal murderer like Netanyahu.”
 


“I have deleted my tweet on Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Netanyahu as the picture is not 100 per cent clear,” said Gulzar in a followup post.
The PTI MNA had further alleged: “What is 200pc clear and proof is available with ‘concerned’ people, a meeting was arranged between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu. I will be demanding logs from Foreign Office of these secret meetings between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu in summer 2025 to discuss Abraham Accords. Good luck on obtaining those. Meeting was arranged beforehand by friends of Israel. Full delegation from both sides present.”
 






Gulzar had subsequently reposted a copy of a first information report (FIR) lodged against her on Sunday at the NCCIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre on the complaint of Technical Assistant Aneesur Rehman under Sections 11 (hate speech), 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person) and 26A (punishment for false and fake information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR referred to the matter of the X posts alleging the PM Shehbaz-Netanyahu meeting, as well as others.
In a statement issued today, the NCCIA said that as per the investigation, the PTI MNA had shared several fake and misleading tweets and videos.
“The content included hateful and inflammatory statements against state institutions. The accused’s tweets attempted to incite racial and linguistic hatred.
“Shandana Gulzar spread fake images and false information regarding the prime minister of Pakistan. The false report alleged a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The fake news spread fear, anxiety, and distrust among the public towards state institutions,” the NCCIA said.

It added that the investigation is ongoing to identify other “individuals and accomplices behind the anti-state campaign”.</p><small>2025-10-23 03:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23080641c032644.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950672/after-zohran-mamdani-another-south-asian-democrat-makes-waves-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>After Zohran Mamdani, another South Asian Democrat makes waves in US</strong></a><br><p>FAIRFAX (Virginia): Much like in New York, where droves of Indian- and Pakistani-American voters are backing Zohran Mamdani in the mayoral race, South Asian voters in Virginia also appear united in their choice for lieutenant governor — Ghazala Hashmi.
Hashmi, an Indian Muslim from Hyderabad with family ties to Karachi, has maintained close relations with both the Pakistani- and Indian-American communities. Those links, community leaders say, have helped her draw rare across-the-board support.
Her campaign’s focus on education, healthcare, and immigrant representation resonates with both South Asian communities, who see in her a shared story of migration and belonging.
“Pakistanis living in the United States should understand that for all practical purposes, they are Americans. Their attachment to Pakistan is emotional,” said Faiz Rahman, a Fairfax resident and a former staffer at the Voice of America’s Urdu Service.

“Her being of Indian origin is of little consequence for us.”
Shopkeeper Kuldip Singh expressed similar sentiments. “And not because she is an Indian,” he said. “I would vote for her because she is a Democrat — and Democrats are good for immigrants.”
The race has tightened in recent weeks, with Hashmi now holding a narrow 44pc-43pc lead over her Republican rival, John Reid, down from 46pc-36pc in July.
The contest briefly took an unusual turn when Reid, frustrated by Hashmi’s refusal to debate, staged a 40-minute YouTube debate against an AI-generated version of her. Democrats dismissed the stunt as a “shoddy gimmick”, but it appears to have resonated with some voters.
 
 

“If you are a candidate, you cannot run away from political debates,” said Mansoor Qureshi, a Republican supporter. “People who plan to vote for her should reconsider.”
Hashmi, who has served in Virginia’s State Senate since 2020, was born in India, but raised in Georgia. She has often spoken about her experience as an immigrant and a Muslim woman in American politics.
“I had to wonder whether, after living here nearly fifty years, I had a home anymore — whether I was welcome here,” she said after her 2019 election. “And I had to prove that answer, not just for myself, but for so many people who feel marginalised.”
That sense of shared struggle appeals to South Asian immigrants, who see their own life stories reflected in hers.
“I am, and I plan on voting for Democrats down the ballot in the midterms,” said Hassan, an NGO-worker from Washington. “People like Ghazala remind us that this country belongs to everyone willing to work for it.”
Hashmi won the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in June, becoming the first Muslim and the first Indian-American to appear on the ballot for a state-wide office in Virginia. She defeated five other candidates to secure the nomination.
“I’m supporting Senator Hashmi for lieutenant governor because I know she will stand for our values and our hard-fought Democratic accomplishments,” said State Senator Kannan Srinivasan of Loudoun, Va. “With her proven track record in improving education, the economy, and healthcare, she will continue to bring the best for Virginians.”
Congressman Ro Khanna also endorsed her, saying, “I am excited to support State Senator Hashmi for lieutenant governor. Ghazala will fight tirelessly for our shared values — women’s reproductive freedom, strong public schools for all children, safe streets without fear of gun violence, and an economy where every family can thrive.”
Hashmi will now face Republican Reid, the first openly gay man to receive a major party’s endorsement for state-wide office in Virginia. He became the de facto nominee after his primary opponent withdrew from the race.
“The Republican choice is bad — by default, Hashmi is a better candidate,” said Zafar Iqbal, a health researcher. “He is openly, not only anti-immigrant, but also anti-Black. Democratic planks that favor minorities, such as health insurance, will be removed under his policies.”
If elected, Hashmi would become the first Muslim and Asian American to hold statewide office in Virginia — a breakthrough that both Indian- and Pakistani-American communities are watching with hope.

MOTORISTS wait for the convoy to get underway, near the Azampur Service Area on the M-5 motorway.—Dawn

• Two armoured vehicles lead each convoy through high-risk stretch
• 72 dacoits with over Rs60m head money surrender in Sindh
• Over 200 weapons laid down, including G3 rifles, RPG launchers and 12.7mm anti-aircraft guns
RAHIM YAR KHAN / SUKKUR: Police in Rahim Yar Khan have started running escorted night convoys on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) during the current week to protect motorists from Katcha dacoit gangs.
Traffic on the M-5 fell sharply after floods eroded a portion of the motorway near Jalalpur Pirwala in September, forcing many drivers to use the National Highway (N-5) instead. However, the traffic flow on M-5 rose again when one lane of the damaged stretch was restored and the motorway reopened via a diversion.
From 7pm to 6am, Rahim Yar Khan police are now halting all vehicles at the Azampur service area between Jamaldin Wali and Bhong and dispatching convoys every half an hour, led by two armoured police pickups. South-to-north traffic from the Sukkur side is escorted from the Guddu interchange to Azampur.
Police adopted the measure after the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped 10 people from multiple vehicles on the M-5 near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5. It was the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing the Sukkur-Multan Motorway within Punjab’s limits.
 
 

“It used to feel like the safest way to travel,” motorist Muhammad Shahid, who drove from Rahim Yar Khan to Rohri, told Dawn. “Now there’s uncertainty,” he lamented, adding that he waited about half an hour at Azampur and then crawled along with the convoy to Guddu interchange.
He added that once the limits of Sindh start, there were no convoys from Guddu to Sukkur, though Sindh police and another law enforcement agency were patrolling.
Another frequent traveller between Sukkur and Lahore said he felt uneasy on parts of the M-5, particularly between Iqbalabad and Rohri interchanges. He described Jahanpur Jungle near Qutub Din Shah service area as “the most frightening stretch where I felt extreme fear”.
RYK police spokesperson Zeeshan Rand­h­awa told Dawn the force was concerned about the safety of lives and property and had deployed bulletproof vehicles and trained personnel “equipped with modern weapons” to move traffic in convoys through high-risk areas.
Insisting that operations against robbers were ongoing, he said, “Once the area is safe, traffic will run as usual rather than in convoys.”
Ghotki SSP Anwar Khaitran told Dawn that Sindh Police had briefly used convoys in January and February last year, but now relied on temporary pickets and heavy patrolling.
“Eight Sindh Police vehicles and eight Rangers vehicles are always on the M-5, in addition to National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) units,” he said.
He added that the NHMP had written to the Punjab IG recommending convoys, but Sindh had addressed the risk through “extensive patrolling”.
SSP Khaitran stressed that government had to adopt a long-term strategy to find a permanent solution and eliminate the Katcha criminals. For this purpose, Katcha areas would be converted into Pacca areas by developing riverine areas and denying cover to criminals, he said.
Dacoits surrender

Separately, more than 70 wanted bandits surrendered under the Sindh government’s ‘Surrender Policy 2025’ at the Shikarpur SSP office on Wednesday, laying down over 200 weapons.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon, senior Rangers officers and local PPP leaders attended the ceremony.
Mr Lanjar praised the police, Rangers and cooperating tribal elders and paid tribute to the martyred officers.
Addressing the surrendering men, the minister said, “You’ve taken a commendable step. Serve your sentences and return as law-abiding citizens.”
He urged remaining gangs to accept the policy, saying it would unlock support for families in Katcha areas — from Benazir Income Support stipends to roads, schools, healthcare, veterinary services and land for homeless farmers.
Warning those still at large, he said: “Surrender, or you will be eliminated inside your hideouts.”
IGP Memon said law and order in Sindh was gradually improving. Kidnapping for ransom, a decades-long scourge, had “almost ended”, he claimed, citing a sustained crackdown since the so-called “Honey Trap Operation” began in 2012.
He said 171 dacoits had been killed and 421 captured injured during police operations.
Rangers’ Sector Commander highlighted joint operations in Katcha and pledged continued support.
DIG Larkana Nasir Aftab said the term “Katcha” had become synonymous with kidnapping and extortion, but coordinated action by police, Rangers and intelligence agencies had shifted the balance.
He said 282 suspects had applied to surrender; more than 70 approvals were issued, along with the deposit of 209 weapons at Wednesday’s ceremony.
Surrendered weapons included 62 G-3 rifles, 97 SMGs, 48 double-barrel shotguns, two RPG-7 launchers, an anti-tank RR-75 and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. Authorities said the combined head money on the surrendered men exceeded Rs60 million.
According to police, several operations had been conducted, including in Garhi Tegho (where 107 hostages were rescued over five months), Kot Shaho, Jagan, Kalhoro (Madeji) and Bagarji (Sukkur).
In Operation Bachal Bhayo, notorious dacoit Shero Mahar was killed.

• Security man loses life in landmine blast
QUETTA: At least 11 militants were killed in separate operations in Chagai and Sibi districts over the past 24 hours, whereas two police constables were martyred in Noshki, and a security official lost his life to a landmine in Kachhi, officials said on Wednesday.
Officials said security forces launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous area of Dalbandin in Chagai after reports of militants hiding there. Troops cordoned off the location and came under heavy fire. A fierce gun battle ensued and lasted about an hour, leaving six suspects dead.
“The Fitna al-Hindustan terrorists were hiding in the area and were detected through aerial reconnaissance,” officials said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the hideout. They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity.
 
 

In a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit.
CTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said.
Arms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital.
Two cops martyred
Meanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday.
Police said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass.
“Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch.
Police moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday.
In another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle.

• Azma asks PPP to rein in its Punjab leader, take notice of remarks
ISLAMABAD: Amid uncertainty over the status of the country’s main wheat-buying body, the PPP has sought clarity from the federal government on the wheat procurement mechanism after the minimum support price was recently set at Rs3,500 per 40kg.
In May this year, the federal food minister informed the National Assembly that the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) was being abolished because the market had been deregulated and the government was not buying the staple anymore.
It may be noted that in line with the IMF demand, the government had deregulated the wheat market much to the chagrin of farmers, but a decision recently overturned through the national wheat policy.
 
 

Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked the PML-N government in Punjab as to who would procure wheat and under what mechanism, following the “abolition” of Passco.
Addressing a press conference, the PPP leader said that in the absence of Passco, farmers were at the mercy of middlemen who had been buying at a price much lower than the recently announced price of Rs3,500.
Mr Murtaza also spoke about the differences with the coalition partner, PML-N, and urged the need for dialogue to resolve disagreements.
“We are allies, you (PMLN) should sit with us and talk so that these differences do not surface again,” he said. He referred to recent reports about the withdrawal of security from Lahore’s Bilawal House, which was denied by the provincial government. “If someone reported that security was removed from Bilawal House in Lahore, they (PMLN) denied it in the media and did not contact us,” he rued.
About the flood relief plan that stirred differences between the two parties, Mr Murtaza clarified that the PPP had given the government an “immediate relief plan” on the flood issue and suggested that the data of the Benazir Income Support Program be used for the purpose, but there was an uproar by the PML-N government over this suggestion.
 
 

He claimed the Punjab CM was provided inaccurate statistics regarding the floods and subsequent losses. “Farmers needed urgent money; for this, we asked you (PMLN) to use the BISP data and provide immediate assistance to the growers so that they could meet their needs,” he added.
Mr Murtaza said the PPP did not want to derail the system, adding that at least the spokespersons of the Punjab government should reconsider their choice of words.
The PPP leader also complained that research centres were not providing seeds to the farmers. “What will a poor farmer do with the limited compensation amount of Rs5,000 per acre when a bag of DAP fertiliser is available for Rs15,000,” he added.
Local govt law
He also reiterated reservations against the local government law. He said the PPP expressed reservations on the legislation as the law was “questionable”. However, the PPP will participate in the polls, he added. “We have serious reservations about the legislation, as non-party-based elections are the beginning of pre-poll rigging,” he said, adding that the PPP would soon present its strategy regarding the local bodies act. “Even if our concerns are not addressed, we will not leave the field open. The PPP will actively participate in the upcoming local government elections,” he said.
It may be noted that the Election Commission of Pakistan on Oct 21 asked the Punjab government to formulate the delimitation rules within four months in light of the new law, as it withdrew an earlier order under which polls could have been held by the end of this year.
‘Take notice’
The PML-N, however, took exception to the press conference by Mr Murtaza, particularly the criticism of the agri policies and the local government act. Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari asked the PPP to take notice of Hassan Murtaza’s remarks; otherwise, the PML-N would be compelled to respond to him.
“Whether Murtaza is conspiring against his own leadership… If anyone owes an apology, it should be to Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto, who could not even keep such defeated elements under control,” she quipped. Ms Bokhari said the PPP never missed a chance to malign the PML-N leadership.
After months of broadsides, the acrimony between the PPP and the PML-N came to an apparent end following meetings between the top leaders, including PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The PM even agreed to use BISP for flood relief, while the PPP central executive committee decided to give its ally one month’s time to make good on the ‘unfulfilled’ promises.

IN PAKISTAN, one-tola (24kt) price has plunged by Rs19,538 in the last six days.—Reuters/file

KARACHI: Gold prices in the local market continued their downward trend on Wednesday, following a sharp decline in international rates.
The prices of 10 grams and one tola of gold dropped by Rs6,463 and Rs7,538, respectively, settling at Rs374,967 and Rs437,362.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), global gold prices fell by $85 per ounce to $4,150 on Wednesday. Since last Friday, international prices have declined by $208 per ounce, resulting in a cumulative decrease of Rs19,538 in the domestic one-tola rate.
Despite the decline, demand has remained subdued. All Pakistan Jewellery Manufacturers Association Chairman Mohammad Arshad stated that despite the ongoing wedding season, customers have not returned in significant numbers.
He noted that demand had already begun to taper off when the price of gold crossed Rs400,000 per tola.
“Many people still cannot afford gold despite the recent drop,” he said, adding that it is difficult for consumers to purchase even a single tola jewellery set, which still costs around Rs450,000.
According to Reuters, gold prices fell on Wednesday to a near two-week low, following their sharpest single-day drop in five years in the previous session, as investors booked profits ahead of key US inflation data due this week.
 
 

Gold prices have notched multiple record highs and gained 54pc this year, bolstered by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, expectations of US rate cuts and strong inflows into ETFs. Prices fell 5.3pc on Tuesday, after notching a record high of $4,381.21 per ounce in the preceding session.
Friday’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, delayed due to the ongoing US government shutdown, is expected to show that core inflation held at 3.1pc in September.
Arshad said that persistently high bullion prices and weak jewellery demand have impacted manufacturing units, with around 60pc of them struggling to sustain operations. Others have scaled down their workforce due to reduced orders.
He also pointed out that investors, who had earlier purchased gold bars and coins, are now holding off on further buying, adopting a wait-and-see approach. He declined to predict future price movements, stating that much would depend on global factors, including political developments.

Subsequently, the PTI has responded that the offer can be considered if the government demonstrates its “seriousness” on the issue.
In an appearance on Asma Shirazi’s talk-show on Hum News, Federal Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry suggested that Mr Khan could be shifted to Banigala, where PTI leaders and his family members can meet him on a daily basis.
 






Later, talking to Dawn, Mr Chaudhry said that there were 8,000 prisoners in Adiala jail and they were also suffering beca­use of the PTI founder and his political activities.
“We are ready to shift him if they submit an appl­i­cation. There [at Bani­gala] PTI leaders can meet him and play Ludo and other games day and night,” the minister added.
He said that Mr Khan cannot be released, but he can be shifted to his Banigala residence by declaring it a sub-jail.
“The PTI should submit a written application to shift Imran Khan from Ad­i­­ala to Banigala. And we will do that [shift him].”
‘Will consider offer’
When approached for a reaction, PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser told Dawn that although he was unaware of such an offer, but it can be considered if the government showed its seriousness.
“I have a gut feeling that the government will backtrack on it. However, if it is serious, we can discuss the offer within the party, our legal team and also with Imran Khan. If Khan sahib gives the nod, we will defiantly submit the [written] application,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser said that the PTI founder was in jail for over two years and legally he has become entitled for bail.
“If the government is serious, it should remove pressure from the judiciary and let the bail be accepted.”
He said that as a gesture of goodwill, the government should allow PTI leaders and family members to meet Mr Khan in jail so that developments could proceed.
It is worth mentioning that in January 2024, the PTI founder’s spouse Bushra Bibi had surrendered herself before the accountability court after being sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana case. Later, she was shifted to her husband’s Banigala residence, which was declared a sub-jail.
However, Ms Bushra alleged that she was being poisoned there.
Later, she approached the Islamabad High Court, which in May last year ordered her transfer from the Banigala residence back to Adiala Jail.

• Official says Pak-EPA lacks financial, technical resources to do its job
• Senate panel urges Centre to strengthen initiatives for climate-vulnerable Gilgit-Baltistan
• Calls for sharing of early-warning data for disaster prevention in northern areas
ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Critical inadequacies in Pakistan’s environmental oversight were highlighted on Wednesday, after a parliamentary committee heard that emission standards remain frozen at Euro-II levels, a benchmark long-abandoned by most nations.
Following the revelation, the National Assembly’s Standing Comm­ittee on Climate Change and Environ­mental Coordination voiced serious concerns and directed the Ministry of Climate Change to present a mechanism for air-quality monitoring, along with a comprehensive action plan.
During the sitting, the committee received a joint briefing from the ministry and the Islamabad Capital Terri­tory administration and was informed that country’s vehicle emission limits remain at Euro-II, far below modern Euro-V and Euro-VI standards.
The panel also noted that the current National Environmental Quality Standards only correspond to Euro-II levels, which have long lost relevance given deteriorating air quality and international shifts toward Euro-V and Euro-VI benchmarks.
“There is no mechanism in place to check emissions or enforce compliance,” said MNA Munaza Hassan, who chairs the committee, characterising the situation as a fundamental failure of oversight.
The scale of the challenge became clearer when Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon told the committee that the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) — the body responsible for monitoring air quality — lacks both the financial resources and technical capacity to fulfil its mandate.
He said the agency had borrowed testing units from Punjab’s EPA, while the Capital Development Authority funded the purchase of five additional units.
Directing the climate ministry to prepare a comprehensive, time-bound air-quality improvement plan within four weeks, the committee called for increased funding and emphasised that the climate agenda must figure prominently in Pakistan’s foreign engagements.
Experts invited to the meeting said targeted management actions could reduce air pollution by up to 30 per cent.
They proposed pragmatic interventions such as staggered school and office timings, improved road infrastructure and catalytic converters for older vehicles and motorbikes.
Further recommendations included incentivising retrofitting, mandating emission testing during vehicle transfers and transitioning to Euro-V-compliant fuels.
“We should at least try to make Islamabad a model city,” Ms Hassan concluded.
More climate action in vulnerable GB
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and SAFRON decided to recommend that the federal government enhance efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the region.
The committee, chaired by Senator Asad Qasim, met in Skardu on Tuesday to discuss climate impacts, forest protection and the status of disaster-preparedness projects. “Gilgit-Baltistan is among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts,” Qasim told Dawn.
“This year, GB experienced unprecedented climate change-induced disasters. Glaciers melting, cloudbursts and glacial-lake outburst floods badly affected GB.”
Qasim said the committee’s goal is to prevent future catastrophes and address challenges faced by the local population.
“We don’t like to see these disasters again in future; we will work for mitigation of the climate change disasters,” he said. “We are listening to the challenges faced by local people from climate change impacts. We have come here to see for ourselves.”
Officials briefed the committee on forest protection efforts and were directed to share a working plan for forests.
They also called for incentives to create awareness and motivation for forest conservation within local communities.
Officials said a comprehensive legal framework is in place to protect forests and that 1.1 million cubic feet of illegal timber has been seized and a plan for its legal utilisation is being prepared.
They noted that residents often depend on wood for fuel because of a lack of electricity, but projects for clean energy generation are being completed on the prime minister’s special instructions.
The meeting was attended by Senators Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, Nasir Mahmood and Ataulhaq, GB Additional Chief Secretary Waheed Shah, Director General GB Disaster Management Authority Zakir Hussain, Commissioner Baltistan Division Kamal Khan and Deputy Commissioner Skardu Hamza Murad.
Early warning systems
A separate sitting of the Senate panel on the UNDP-funded GLOF-II and Early Warning System was also convened in Skardu to review disaster management and early-warning systems in GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
Project Head Muteeb Ali told members that of 292 early-warning stations established in GB and KP, 218 are fully functional; 77 face communication issues and civil work is underway at 23 others.
The committee directed full coordination among the Gilgit-Baltistan Disa­ster Management Auth­ority, district administrations, the Meteorological Department and the UNDP to make the system more effective.
Members also stressed that all relevant agencies should be given access to early-warning data and the dashboard to enable a timely, coordinated response during any emergency.

According to a report compiled by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), second sitting had the highest number of MNAs (200 or 61pc of the current membership) present during the session. 
The third sitting had the lowest number of MNAs in attendance (159 or 49pc). As many as 216 (66pc ) MNAs skipped at least one sitting during the session.
As Many as 50 (23pc of 216) MNAs submitted applications for leave of absence during the session. As many as 166 (77 pc of 216) MNAs skipped the House proceedings without any formal leave application in advance.
Among the cabinet members, four federal ministers and one state minister attended all the sittings. The PM did not attend any sitting, while the office of the Leader of the Opposition remained vacant during the session.
Attendance patterns by sitting
As in previous sessions, female members generally had higher attendance than their male counterparts. The second sitting saw the highest attendance, with 200 members (61pc of the current membership) present.
This session was a Private Members’ Day, during which the minister for housing and works moved motion 288 to suspend the agenda to discuss the country’s flood situation under motion 259, which had been previously introduced by the minister for parliamentary affairs in the first sitting. The lowest attendance occurred during the third (last) sitting, with only 159 members (49pc ) present. An analysis of attendance records and leave applications announced during the proceedings shows that 216 members (66pc of the current strength) missed at least one sitting during the session. However, only 50 members (23pc of those absent) submitted applications seeking leave from the House for their absence.

The policy, approved earlier this month, will allow dacoits to surrender arms in return for assurances of protection for their families, rehabilitation and livelihood support.
For decades, dozens of dacoit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and looting people on highways have become a daily reality.
According to a press release from the home department, “Around 72 dacoits surrendered under the Sindh Surrender Policy, and laid down more than 200 small-scale and heavy ammunition.”
The weapons include: 62 G3 rifles, 97 submachine guns, 48 double-barreled guns, two RPG 7s, an anti-tank recoilless rifle and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun.
The dacoits who surrendered had a cumulative bounty of Rs60 million on their heads, the press release said.
Earlier, at a ceremony held to mark the official launch of the policy, a Rangers sector commander said, “Today, more than 70 dacoits have surrendered themselves to the law, and 209 weapons have been laid down,” according to a separate press release from the home department.
The ceremony was held at the Senior Superintendent of Police’s office in Shikarpur, where Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar was the chief guest.
In attendance at the ceremony were: Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Larkana, officers of Sindh Rangers, and other officials. Also present were MPA Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh, Shehryar Mahar, Abid Bhayo, Gul Muhammad Jakhrani, and other leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party, the press release said.
The Rangers official detailed that till now “a total of 282 dacoits had applied for surrender under the policy, out of which 70 requests have been approved”.
Addressing the dacoits at the ceremony, the home minister said, “You have taken a commendable step by surrendering yourselves to the law because it reflects your desire to become law-abiding and peaceful citizens.“
“After serving your sentences, you will once again become part of the peace-loving community of this city and country,” he added.
The minister further directed their fellow dacoits to follow suit so their families living in the riverine areas can receive basic facilities, issuing a warning that: “Surrender yourselves, otherwise we will come for you inside your hideouts, because you are enemies of poor people and their property.”
The minister, in his address, also “appreciated tribal chiefs for their cooperation with the government on the matter”.
Lanjar assured the dacoits that the “Sindh government wants to ensure education and a bright future for the children of those who have surrendered”.
On the matter of the law and order situation in Sindh, IGP Sindh noted that the situation was “gradually improving.”
“Kidnapping for ransom had been a challenge for over 40 years, but it has now almost ended, and areas once filled with dacoits are now completely cleared,” he was quoted as saying.
“A total of 171 dacoits have been killed, and 421 have been captured [and] injured during police operations. This is our greatest success,” he was quoted as saying.
Sindh Surrender Policy
On October 7, the Sindh cabinet okayed a policy to allow dacoit gangs in the riverine areas of the province to lay down their arms and surrender in return for assurances from the government.
Officials told the cabinet members that following successful security operations and extensive negotiations with local communities, many dacoits had expressed willingness to surrender voluntarily.
The main features of the policy include mandatory disarmament, protection of families, rehabilitation and livelihood support and access to education, healthcare and vocational training.
The provincial government would also revive schools, health, veterinary and development projects in the riverine areas to sustain peace and stability.
However, as per the policy, surrender does not mean pardon or immunity, and all surrendering individuals will face the prevailing law of the land.</p><small>2025-10-22 20:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22231532e59114a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950600/pm-shehbaz-discusses-countrys-political-landscape-with-kp-lawmakers-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz discusses country’s political landscape with KP lawmakers, leaders</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Wednesday held a meeting with lawmakers and political leaders from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and discussed the “overall political landscape” in the country with them, said a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
“PM Shehbaz discussed the current overall political landscape with KP lawmakers and leaders, as well as reviewed progress on ongoing development projects in the province,” said the statement.
“The meeting focused on federal efforts to boost socio-economic development in KP and enhance coordination between the Centre and provincial stakeholders,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier stressed the “need for sustained political engagement to ensure stability and growth in the province,” the report said.
During the meeting, PM Shehbaz “emphasised that KP remains a key priority in the national agenda”.
The prime minister also “directed relevant authorities to expedite key infrastructure and welfare projects”.
The PTI-led KP government’s relationship with the federal government has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks, particularly on the matter of counter-terrorism efforts.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements.
On October 20, the newly elected KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
He also criticised the Centre for not providing KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism or “other Constitutional rights.”</p><small>2025-10-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22212621569d1e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950590/climate-change-population-growth-hindering-pakistan-from-becoming-3tr-economy-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Climate change, population growth hindering Pakistan from becoming $3tr economy: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that unchecked population growth and climate change are hindering Pakistan from becoming a $3 trillion economy.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
At the same time, Pakistan has been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025.
“I have been clear right from the beginning that we have two existential issues because if we don’t tackle them correctly … there are two reasons that could derail us from becoming a $3tr economy and those are climate change and population growth,” said the finance minister in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’.
Aurangzeb said the former was no longer merely “an academic discussion” but something “we are living day in and day out”, pointing to the onset of the smog season in Lahore and the recent flood which devastated large tracts of Pakistan.
The finance czar said the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events were increasing, adding that he had participated in three forums during the last week that discussed the matter of climate change.
 
 

“There is no way to put a value on the precious human lives we have lost,” he said of the deaths in the recent floods and climate disasters overall, adding that the growth goal for this year was targeted at 4.2pc but “there is no doubt now that at least 0.4-0.5pc will be shaved off.”
He stated that 80pc of the damage caused by the recent floods was sustained in Punjab, predominantly impacting the agriculture sector, especially rice and cotton-producing regions.
Regarding the government measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, the finance minister said Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik was tasked by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to devise a plan for the next 300 days.
MNCs exiting Pakistan
 
 

Questioned about the recent high-profile departures of multinational companies from the country, Aurangzeb said there were multiple aspects to the issue.
“These global companies make decisions on their participation regarding which clients to stay with, which products to stay with and in which countries to remain.”
Mentioning his own past example, he pointed to the exit of the Royal Bank of Scotland from Pakistan, adding that the entity had decided at the time to exit all global money markets.
He further said that while some companies were indeed exiting, some entered the market during the past three to four years, pointing to Aramco and others.
There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here. Some of the prominent ones include Procter & Gamble, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10pc annually, over the last two years.
Stability but no growth due to no reforms: Miftah Ismail
Meanwhile, speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said that while stability was indeed achieved, key reforms were needed for growth but they were not carried out and instead the government had not reduced its expenses but raised taxes, thus dampening demand.
He also pointed to the lack of reduction in the share of the provinces in the National Finance Commission award as a reason for lack of growth.
The former finance minister also criticised government sprawl at the federal and provincial levels, saying: “If the government steps back just a little, the private sector will handle it.”
Ismail said there was a lack of incentive for foreign companies to enter the country with his high taxation and utility costs for gas and electricity. He added that the entire energy infrastructure of the country needed a rehaul to move away to more cheaper methods such as solar and wind.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22221726d6dd2ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950595/pakistan-will-not-travel-to-india-for-junior-hockey-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not travel to India for Junior Hockey World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Hockey Federation on Wednesday finalised its decision to not send its team to India for next month’s Junior World Cup, slated to held from Nov 28 to Dec 10.
The decision came after a high-profile meeting in Islamabad where the security issues and India’s hostile approach towards Pakistan in the sports sector, particularly the conduct of its cricket team during the recent Asia Cup, came under discussion.
“The PHF will convey its decision to Hockey India soon,” a PHF official told Dawn.com. “The PHF and the government don’t want to compromise on security of players, therefore we decided not to send our team.”
International Cricket Council, the sports global body, has arranged for neutral venues for both Pakistan and India during tournaments held in either country. Hockey’s governing body, the FIH, however, hasn’t made any such hybrid arrangement. Pakistan skipped the Asia Cup in India last month despite the tournament being a qualifier for next year’s World Cup.
Meanwhile, the issue of PHF elections was taken by the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter Provincial Coordination, which met here at under the Chairmanship of MNA Sheikh Aftab Ahmed.
During the course of meeting, the convener of sub-committee presented a report on the PHF. The committee was told that the PHF had agreed to conduct the scrutiny of clubs and elections of committee.
During the meeting, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid told the committee that issue of elections of PHF and scrutiny of clubs will be placed before the Executive Committee of PHF in its meeting on November 7 and a subsequent announcement will be made.
The committee directed the PHF that the election commission should be formed with representation of Pakistan Sports Board while club scrutiny should be carried out with consultation and representation of PSB.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221947204cf122f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950585/world-court-says-israel-must-ensure-basic-needs-in-gaza-are-met' target='_blank'><strong>World Court says Israel must ensure basic needs in Gaza are met</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations’ top legal body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), on Wednesday said Israel has an obligation to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met.
The panel of 11 judges added that Israel is forced to support the relief efforts provided by the United Nations in the Gaza strip and its entities, including the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Israel has not substantiated its claims that a significant number of UNRWA’s employees are members of Hamas, the judges said.
The ICJ said that Israel was obliged to ease the passage of aid into Gaza, stressing it had to provide Palestinians with “basic needs” essential to survival.
 






The wide-ranging ICJ ruling came as aid groups are scrambling to scale up much-needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza, seizing upon a fragile ceasefire agreed earlier this month.
The ICJ’s “Advisory Opinion” is not legally binding but the court believes it carries “great legal weight and moral authority”.
Israel did not take part in the proceedings but an official told journalists before the hearing that it was “an abuse of international law”.
The official added that Israel “cooperates with international organisations, with other UN agencies regarding Gaza. But Israel will not cooperate with UNRWA”.
ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa said the ICJ “rejects the argument that the request abuses and weaponises the international judicial process”.
 






On the eve of the ICJ ruling, Abeer Etefa, Middle East spokeswoman for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), said 530 of the organisation’s trucks had crossed into Gaza since the ceasefire.
Those trucks had delivered more than 6,700 tonnes of food, which she said was “enough for close to half a million people for two weeks”.
Etefa said around 750 tonnes a day were now coming through, which, although more than before the ceasefire, remains well below WFP’s target of around 2,000 tonnes daily.
The ICJ said that Israel, as an occupying power, was under an obligation “to ensure the basic needs of the local population, including the supplies essential for their survival”.
At the same time, Israel was “also under a negative obligation not to impede the provision of these supplies”, the court said.
The court also recalled the obligation under international law not to use starvation as a method of warfare.
 






‘Serious concerns’
The UN had asked the ICJ to clarify Israel’s obligations, as an occupying power, towards UN and other bodies “including to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival” of Palestinians.
ICJ judges heard a week of evidence in April from dozens of nations and organisations, much of which revolved around the status of UNRWA.
At the ICJ hearings, a US official raised “serious concerns” about UNRWA’s impartiality, and alleged that Hamas used the agency’s facilities.
The US official, Josh Simmons, said Israel had “no obligation to permit UNRWA specifically to provide humanitarian assistance”.
Simmons added that UNRWA was not the only option for delivering aid into Gaza.
However, the ICJ noted that UNRWA “cannot be replaced on short notice without a proper transition plan”.
Palestinian official Ammar Hijazi told the ICJ judges during the April hearings that Israel was blocking aid as a “weapon of war”, sparking starvation in Gaza.
Wednesday’s case was separate from the others Israel faces under international law over its campaign in Gaza.
In July 2024, the ICJ issued another advisory opinion stating that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories was “unlawful” and must end as soon as possible.
ICJ judges are also weighing accusations, brought by South Africa, that Israel has broken the 1948 UN Genocide Convention with its actions in Gaza.
Another court in The Hague, the International Criminal Court, has issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was killed in an airstrike.</p><small>2025-10-22 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22172131cbb3503.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950577/pti-announces-massive-public-rally-in-karachi-to-kick-off-nationwide-public-engagement-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces ‘massive public rally’ in Karachi to kick off nationwide public engagement campaign</strong></a><br><p>The PTI announced on Wednesday that a “massive public rally” would be held in Karachi during the month of November to kick off a nationwide public engagement campaign.
A press release issued today said the decision was taken during PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja’s visit to Karachi. During his visit, he met party leaders, including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, PTI Parliamentary Leader Shabbir Qureshi and Jamal Siddiqui.
Raja held detailed discussions on the prevailing political situation, strategy for party founder Imran Khan’s release and organisational matters.
Addressing the media after the meetings, Raja announced that a “massive public rally will be held in Karachi” in November, followed by similar gatherings in Hyderabad and other major cities as part of a nationwide public engagement campaign.
The senior PTI leader added that the party was united and mobilised for Imran’s release.
 
 

He informed those present that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated as opposition leader in the National Assembly and Raja Nasir Abbas in the Senate, while Sohail Afridi had been appointed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, terming the recent moves as symbolising “a wave of political renewal within PTI”.
“We stand firm for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” Barrister Raja said. “Truth and justice will prevail. All cases fabricated against Imran Khan are proving false in the courts. However, delaying tactics are being used to hinder justice, but these baseless cases will soon be over.”
Reiterating Imran’s message to the nation, Raja said: “Patron in Chief Imran Khan has urged the people to keep faith in Allah Almighty; victory always belongs to truth. He has directed the party to reach out to the public through rallies across the country to raise awareness against oppression and injustice.”
Expressing grave concern over the situation in Sindh, Raja said that the PPP had “in the last 17 years … turned Sindh into ruins”.
He noted that from Karachi to the interior of the province, cities were in a state of decay, adding that lawlessness and insecurity had made life miserable for citizens.
Raja said he had personally visited several cities of Sindh and found a “scene of desolation and hopelessness everywhere“.
“Rampant corruption by the PPP has plundered Sindh’s public resources,” he asserted. “But the people of Sindh are now awake. Wherever we went, we witnessed overwhelming support for Imran Khan. The people of Sindh want change; they want a leader like Imran Khan: honest, brave, and dedicated to the nation.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
The party said last week that Imran has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole.
The party had also aired concerns earlier this month about Imran being transferred from Adiala Jail to some unknown location to prevent his access to his family and legal team.</p><small>2025-10-22 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22165639411776e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950570/saudi-arabia-bans-employers-from-charging-domestic-workers-for-recruitment-work-permit' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia bans employers from charging domestic workers for recruitment, work permit</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia has banned employers from charging any fees to their domestic workers, including for recruitment and work permits, setting maximum penalties of a fine worth 20,000 riyals (SR) and a three-year ban on hiring, according to Saudi Gazette.
The Saudi outlet reported on Monday that employers were banned from “charging any fees from their domestic workers”, including those “related to recruitment, change of professions, transfer of services, residency permit (iqama) and work permits”.
 






Saudi Gazette said the provisions were included in the “Guide to the Rights and Obligations of Domestic Workers”, issued by the Saudi human resources ministry. It added that the new regulations “include a package of rights that guarantee the domestic worker a decent life and a stable work environment”.
According to a guide available on the Saudi human resources ministry’s website, professions/jobs permitted by law in the domestic worker sector include “domestic worker, private driver, educator, home nurse, home cook, home planning, home travel, home life, home manager, home guard, home farmer, home coffee-maker, personal assistant, and physical therapy specialist”.
The guidelines also allow the addition of any other profession that may be within household tasks.
The guide defines a domestic worker as any person “who performs domestic work or the like directly or indirectly for the domestic employer and any member of the staff under his supervision who performs domestic work or someone who takes his place”.
 
 

To deter violations, the regulations set a “financial fine that may reach up to SR20,000, in addition to the possibility of being banned from recruiting for a period of up to three years”.
The ban may be extended to become permanent in some cases, with the penalty doubled in case of repeated violation, the report added.
Meanwhile, the regulations also mandate domestic workers to ensure proper conduct, including taking care of the employer’s property, maintaining household secrets, respecting Islam and keeping societal values and morals in mind.
A domestic worker who violates the regulations will face a fine of up to SR2,000, or a permanent ban on working in Saudi Arabia, or both.
“Fines shall be multiplied by the number of violations proven against the domestic worker. The violating domestic worker shall bear the costs of his return to his home country,” the guide stated.
According to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, over 2.05 million Pakistani workers, including those in the domestic sector, were registered for employment in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to September this year.
Rights of domestic workers
The new regulations also stipulate that “domestic workers shall be disbursed with their wages according to the unified contract signed with the employer,” Saudi Gazette reported.
Saudi Arabia has recorded minor violations of its strict labour regulations for decades, allowing an influx of cheap labour used both by companies and as domestic workers.
Yemen, Egypt, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines all have large numbers of citizens working in the country and all rely heavily on their remittances.
According to Saudi Gazette, the new guidelines stress workers’ right to a weekly rest day agreed upon in the contract.
The provisions also include “daily rest hours of no less than eight continuous hours, in addition to a full month’s leave after completing two years of continuous work if the worker wishes to renew the work contract”.
Domestic workers also have the right to obtain a “travel ticket to his/her country every two years at the employer’s expense, an end-of-service gratuity equivalent to one month’s salary upon completing four consecutive years, and sick leave of up to 30 days per year when needed, based on an approved medical report”.
They also have the right to keep all their identification documents, such as their passport and iqama, with the employer not allowed to confiscate them.
Under the guidelines, as per Saudi Gazette, the employer is obligated to enable the worker to communicate with his family in a normal manner, issue and renew residency and legal licences at his own expense, and pay the monthly wage regularly as per the contract.
 
 

In 2008, the Human Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to improve labour law protections and end its “sponsorship” system to prevent domestic workers from being treated like slaves.
Under the “sponsorship” system, also known as the “kafala” system, foreigners in Saudi Arabia obtain a visa through their employer, who usually retains their passports, binding them to the recruiter.
In 2021, the kingdom amended the kafala system by allowing some migrant workers to leave the country without their employer’s permission.</p><small>2025-10-22 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2218131647dd157.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950475/youth-in-gujranwala-kills-aunt-accusing-her-of-blasphemy' target='_blank'><strong>Youth in Gujranwala kills aunt accusing her of blasphemy</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: A youth allegedly killed his aunt by slitting her throat at her house in People’s Colony, Gujranwala, on Tuesday, later claiming that she had “committed blasphemy” three months back.
Reports say that the suspect, Ghulam Murslaeen of Multan, arrived at the house of victim Farah (30) (sister of his father) when her two children were at school and her husband Shahzad was at work.
The suspect allegedly slit Farha’s throat with a sharp knife, leaving her dead on spot. He then came out of the house carrying the blood-stained knife and started shouting that he punished his aunt for “committing blasphemy”.
 
 

Meanwhile, locals gathered at the scene and some of them started beating the suspect with cricket bats and kicks, leaving him injured. On being called by some area residents, police reached the spot and arrested the suspect.
A team of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) also reached the spot and collected evidence from the crime scene.
The victim’s dead body was shifted to the district headquarters hospital for autopsy.
Police high-ups have constituted a special investigation team led by the Gujranwala SSP investigation to probe the incident.
Official sources say that as per the initial police investigation, the suspect stated that his aunt had visited his house in Multan around three months ago, where during some discussions, she allegedly uttered derogatory remarks against some holy figures of Islam.
The suspect also stated that he was inspired by some religious scholars, and after listening to their lectures on social media, he concluded that his aunt had committed blasphemy, following which he decided to kill her.
However, a police spokesman says that the suspect might be trying to mislead investigators through blasphemy allegations to conceal the actual motive behind the crime. He says that the case would be investigated from all aspects.
The deceased woman had been married to Shahzad of Gujranwala around 13 years ago and the couple had a son and a daughter aged 10 and 12 years.
Police have registered a case against the nominated suspect under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the report of Shahzad.
However, in the first information report (FIR) lodged with the People’s Colony police station, the alleged issue of blasphemy has not been mentioned.

Harmer took 3-26 as Pakistan ended the third day on a precarious 94-4 — just 23 runs ahead with six wickets and two days remaining on a spin-spiced Rawalpindi stadium pitch.
Pakistan’s last hopes rest on Babar Azam, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Rizwan, 16 not out, as they strive to win the two-match series, having won the first Test by 93 runs in Lahore.
South Africa piled up 404 runs after Senuran Muthusamy scored a career-best 89 not out and Kagiso Rabada posted his highest Test score of 71, giving the visitors a crucial 71-run lead.
The home team scored 333 in their first innings.
With their backs to the wall, Pakistan’s second innings started disastrously as opener Imam-ul-Haq (nine) and skipper Shan Masood (nought) fell to Harmer with the score at 16.
It became 16-3 when Rabada had Abdullah Shafique caught in the slips for six.
Harmer returned for his second spell to dismiss Saud Shakeel, who was caught in the slips for 11 to end a resolute 44-run third wicket stand.
Earlier, Asif Afridi became the oldest debutant to take a five or more wicket haul in Tests with figures of 6-79.
His effort had South Africa struggling on 221-7 as Pakistan looked set for a lead, but home skipper Masood’s decision to take the second new ball proved a big mistake.
Muthusamy played an anchor role in helping to add 169 for the last two wickets before Asif ended the innings on the stroke of tea.
Muthusamy defied the Pakistan spinners, hitting eight fours to improve on his previous highest score of 68 not out against Bangladesh at Chattogram last year.
Muthusamy added an invaluable 71 runs for the ninth wicket with Keshav Maharaj (30) and then increased the lead with a last-wicket stand worth 98.
Rabada smashed four sixes and as many fours, improving on the 47 he made against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2022.
Asif beats Marriott’s record
The morning belonged to Asif, who at 38 years and 301 days overtook England’s Charles Marriott as the oldest debutant to take five wickets.
Marriott did so against the West Indies at The Oval in 1933 aged 37 years and 332 days.
Like fellow left-armer Maharaj — who took seven wickets for the visitors in Pakistan’s 333 all out — Asif used the dry conditions to maximum effect.
With the turn on the Rawalpindi stadium pitch increasing considerably, Asif dismissed Kyle Verreynne caught behind by wicketkeeper Rizwan for 10 with the fourth ball of the day.
Tristan Stubbs defied Pakistan’s spinners for 256 minutes before a fastish delivery from Asif trapped him leg-before for 76. His knock was studded with six fours and a six.
Asif completed his five-wicket haul by trapping Harmer leg-before for two while Noman Ali dismissed Marco Jansen in the same manner for 12.</p><small>2025-10-22 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2216591463b58f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950575/fo-condemns-israels-renewed-attacks-on-gaza-calls-on-intl-community-to-intervene' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Israel’s renewed attacks on Gaza, calls on int’l community to intervene</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday condemned Israel’s renewed hostilities in Gaza, following a US-backed ceasefire agreement, calling on the international community to take “urgent and effective” measures against the violation.
Israeli forces have killed at least 87 Palestinians, among them civilians, since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and two Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinian freedom fighters in southern Gaza over the weekend, Reuters reported. On Sunday, more than 100 air strikes were reported in Rafah and Khan Younis in the south, Jabalia in the north, and other parts of central Gaza.
While Israel accuses Hamas of initiating the hostilities with an attack on its forces in Rafah, the group has denied any knowledge or connection to the incident.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, resulting in the loss of numerous civilian lives,” said a statement released by the Foreign Office (FO) today.
 






It noted that Israeli actions “run contrary to the spirit of the peace agreement signed in Sharm El-Sheikh in the presence of leadership from the Muslim and Arab world, [the] US, Europe, and the UN.”
The FO, in its statement, urged the international community to “take urgent and effective measures to end these violations and to ensure full implementation of the ceasefire and protection of Palestinian civilians.
“Reaffirming its unwavering support for the Palestinian people, Pakistan calls for an immediate end to Israeli hostilities and reiterates its principled position for the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
Pakistan was among the eight countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
Most Americans support US recognition of Palestinian state, poll shows
Most Americans — including 80 per cent of Democrats and 41pc of Republicans — think the US should recognise Palestinian statehood, a sign that Trump’s opposition to doing so is out of step with public opinion, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, found 59pc of respondents backed US recognition of a Palestinian state, while 33pc were opposed and the rest were unsure or did not answer the question.
About half of Trump’s Republicans — 53pc — opposed doing so, while 41pc of Republicans said they would support the US recognising a Palestinian state.
A growing number of countries — including US allies Britain, Canada, France and Australia — have formally recognised Palestinian statehood in recent weeks, drawing condemnation from Israel, whose founding in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and decades of conflict.
Israeli bombardments have leveled vast swaths of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza following an October 2023 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Some 60pc of poll respondents said Israel’s response in Gaza was excessive, compared to 32pc who disagreed.
Trump, who returned to the White House in January, has largely backed Israel in its offensive and this month brokered a ceasefire, raising hopes that a lasting peace could be in reach.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll gave signs that the US public was ready to give Trump credit should his plan work. Some 51pc of poll respondents agreed with a statement that Trump “deserves significant credit” if peace efforts are successful, compared with 42pc who disagreed.
 
 

While only one in 20 Democrats approve of Trump’s overall performance as president, one in four said he should get significant credit if the peace holds.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and gathered responses from 4,385 people nationwide. It had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><small>2025-10-22 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/220815415ff8871.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950541/imperial-college-london-refutes-punjab-govts-claims-of-campus-in-lahore-says-has-no-such-plans' target='_blank'><strong>Imperial College London refutes Punjab govt’s claims of campus in Lahore, says has no such plans</strong></a><br><p>Imperial College London has refuted the Punjab government’s claims that it is opening a campus at the Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, saying that all of its campuses are based in the United Kingdom (UK).
On October 18, the PML-N had posted on its official X account about a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The post said that a campus of Imperial College London would open at the Nawaz Sharif IT City, adding that the foundation stone would be laid in November.
“A modern 300-bed hospital will also be built within the college campus,” it said.
 






In a separate post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb had also made a similar statement about the meeting chaired by the chief minister.
“A campus of Imperial College London will be established in the Nawaz Sharif IT City which will also include a state-of-the-art 300-bed hospital and its foundation stone will be laid in November,” she had said. The post has since been deleted.

The official X account for the Punjab government had also reiterated the same.
 






However, the educational institute refuted these claims, terming them “incorrect”.
“Reports that Imperial College London plans to open a campus overseas are incorrect,” the college said in a post on its official website on Monday.
“There have been erroneous reports in the media and online that Imperial is opening a campus at Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, Pakistan. Imperial has no such plans, with all the university’s campuses based in the UK,” it said.
It further directed those interested in the college’s global activity to its International Relations Office webpage.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Central Business District (CBD), a department under the provincial government set up to establish urban regeneration projects, also issued a statement, saying the planned college will be a collaboration between a trust of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and NovaCare.
“The upcoming healthcare university and affiliated medical college at CBD NSIT (Nawaz Sharif IT) is a collaborative initiative between NovaCare and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (UK) — an independent NHS institution,” it said.
The CBD added that the project “remains firmly on track under the NovaCare–ICHT partnership, advancing our mission to establish a world-class hub for healthcare education, research, and innovation at CBD NSIT, Lahore, under the direct supervision” of the Imperial College Healthcare trust.
 






Earlier, former chairman of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Javed Hassan, said that as an alumnus of Imperial College London, he was “briefly bemused by the bold claim of a campus in Nawaz Sharif IT City”.
“Turns out Imperial College is less adventurous — its campus plans remain firmly UK-bound. Verification, it seems, is still a novel concept,” he said.
 






Punjab CM Maryam had officially inaugurated the Nawaz Sharif IT City project commercially in May last year. During the ceremony, the chief minister had stated that several international tech giants were showing interest, with 10 companies already planning to establish their offices there. The IT city spans 853 acres and is designated as tax-free for 10 years.</p><small>2025-10-22 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22134211a93e1aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950553/justice-ayesha-says-26th-amendment-does-not-bar-full-court-from-hearing-cases-before-constitutional-bench' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Ayesha says 26th Amendment does not bar full court from hearing cases before Constitutional Bench</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ayesha Malik on Wednesday observed that there was no bar on a full Supreme Court hearing a case fixed before the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A introduced in the 26th Amendment.
She made the remarks as an eight-member resumed hearing over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
At the time, the PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The hearing
Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, counsel for veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, presented his arguments today.
The live stream of the hearing initially faced technical issues, with the audio being cut off. However, the issues were later resolved with proceedings being streamed as per usual. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Thursday).
 


Justice Aminuddin Khan is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Ayesha, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
At the outset of the hearing, Hosain emphasised that the judiciary’s reputation “does not depend on the 26th Constitutional Amendment”. “This case should be heard by a different independent bench,” the lawyer asserted.

Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Do you not trust this bench?”, at which the lawyer said that a decision on Article 191A — through which the CB in the apex court was introduced — should be taken by the “original full court”.
Justice Rizvi noted that Hosain’s petition did mention the term “original full court”. The counsel clarified that he did not say “this bench is not independent”.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You yourself said that the case should be kept before another independent bench. Will we judges be included in that ‘independent bench’?”
Justice Aminuddin also wondered whether CJP Yahya Afridi would be a part of that “independent bench”, to which Hosain replied that he “absolutely would be”.
Here, Justice Mandokhail questioned Hosain that if the current CB “could not hear this case, how could it issue any order?”.
The lawyer replied, “Why is the court seeking a path to issue an order? So far, the Centre has not raised any objection to a full court or [the CB] issuing any order.”
Justice Aminuddin responded that each lawyer had their own stance, and that the bench was raising questions after considering the Constitution. “Some lawyers are even saying to keep aside the Amendment,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
At one point, Justice Mazhar noted, “If 26 judges are included, then it will become a regular bench.” Hosain also agreed that it would not be a constitutional bench.
Justice Mandokhail recalled Dr Adnan Khan’s arguments from yesterday, in which he contended that the SC and the CB were separate entities. The judge then directed the lawyer to detail when the concept of benches came into existence.
When Justice Mazhar mentioned that some lawyers argued that other SC judges can also be included in the current bench, Hosain asserted that the CB was also a bench of the apex court.
Justice Ayesha then directed the counsel to read Article 191A in conjunction with its Clause 3, which says “no bench of the Supreme Court other than a Constitutional Bench shall exercise the following jurisdictions vested in the Supreme Court”, with the latter including the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184.
 
 

Justice Ayesha observed that the provision said the specified jurisdictions were to be exercised by the SC’s CB. “For some reason, we keep reading this as an ouster to say that no one else will [hear the case]. It simply says no other bench will do it.”
She further said that even if Article 191A was interpreted to mean that “no other bench” will hear such cases, it meant that the CB would hear “a case on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court” and interpret the Constitution.
“Where is the bar? […] It (the CB) is reading the provisions of the Constitution and interpreting it, and in doing that interpretation, it is saying that […] because this is a matter of a Constitutional Amendment, we interpret this to mean that a full court can hear the matter. Would that make sense?”
Justice Ayesha remarked, “I am speaking for myself; I, in the first case, said I don’t see a bar.” She added that as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is to nominate judges for the CB.
The judge termed Article 191A a “procedural” provision. She noted that while it imposes restrictions on benches, it does not on the SC, adding that the CB was interpreting the provisions as if they impose a “complete restriction”.
Justice Mazhar then expressed his “complete agreement” with Hosain’s argument that contention that a 16-member bench will be a regular bench, and not a CB.
Hosain contended, “If you say that your hands are tied, then that is not the case. Nowhere is it written that a Constitutional Bench cannot refer the matter to the full court.”
Justice Mandokhail then wondered whether the lawyer meant that the CB could not refer the case to a regular bench but could do so to a full court. “But then that will also be a regular bench. He (Hosain) said that a 16-member bench will be a regular one,” the judge added.
Hosain replied that the judges’ powers had not been taken away from them. “If, let’s suppose, the parliament tomorrow decides under a 27th amendment that an executive officer will preside over the Supreme Court, will you judges not be able to review that decision? You definitely can,” he said.
Khattak’s counsel argued that the appropriate procedure for passing the 26th Amendment had not been followed, at which Justice Mazhar said this question could be raised before the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) when arguing on the merits of the case.
At one point, Justice Hassan remarked that the lawyer was “seeking the main relief” through his current petition before the CB.
Hosain replied, “My CMA (civil miscellaneous application) does not say strike down the 26th Amendment. My CMA is very focused, which is what is before your lordships now. It is ‘please send these cases to the original full court […] and there is nothing stopping you from doing that’.”
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail wondered who would hear such a challenge if the “jurisdiction of the entire Supreme Court was taken away through any Constitutional amendment”.
“Even if the powers are taken away, the same Supreme Court will hear it,” he observed, recalling previous arguments that the current CB was not eligible to hear the case against the same 26th Amendment that led to it.
Hosain reiterated that there was no bar on the CB referring the matter to the full court, adding that he was not seeking a final decision from the current bench, but a directive to forward the case to the full court.
“Your lordships have the power. Please do not underestimate your power,” the counsel said. Hosain then concluded his arguments, following which the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
Requests for full court
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s (BHCBA) counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2213555835c1257.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950564/after-kp-cms-complaints-naqvi-says-bulletproof-vehicles-to-be-sent-to-balochistan-instead' target='_blank'><strong>After KP CM’s complaints, Naqvi says bulletproof vehicles to be sent to Balochistan instead</strong></a><br><p>After complaints by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi regarding  bulletproof vehicles provided by the federal government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that the vehicles in question would be sent to Balochistan instead.
On Monday, Afridi had blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other constitutional rights”. He had also alleged that the bulletproof cars provided by Naqvi were “defective and old”, adding that they should be recalled.
Late on Tuesday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had commented on the claims and said that like KP, his province was also affected by terrorism.
“It is an appeal to the interior minister that if the KP government is refusing to take the bulletproof vehicles, they should be transferred to the Balochistan government so that terrorism can be countered effectively,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Today, Naqvi responded to Bugti’s post and said: “CM sahib, done. These bulletproof vehicles will be sent to Balochistan immediately to enhance counter-terrorism efforts. Thank you for raising this.”
 






On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had criticised the new KP chief minister, expressing disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”. He alleged that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism “so they could use it to blackmail the government”.
Responding to Afridi’s comment on the vehicles, the minister said that it was “unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, adding that the KP government was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22122327b2289b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950551/pakistan-navy-ship-seizes-drugs-worth-nearly-1bn-in-arabian-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy ship seizes drugs worth nearly $1bn in Arabian Sea</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Wednesday from the naval network overseeing the operation.
The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16.
“The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said.
The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added.
The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated.
It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying.
“The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement that the achievement highlighted its “unwavering commitment to regional maritime security, global peace, and the collective fight against illicit trafficking at sea”.
It further said that the successful operation reaffirmed Pakistan’s “active role as a responsible maritime partner contributing to peace and security in the wider Indian Ocean region”.
The statement further said that Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended the crew for their professionalism and dedication.
“He emphasised that Pakistan Navy remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard national maritime interests while contributing to the global commons through cooperation and coordinated maritime security efforts,” it quoted him as syaing.
“The naval chief underscored that PNS Yarmook’s operation under Saudi-led task force will further enhance the interoperability between the two navies and strengthen defence collaboration between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it added.
President Asif Ali Zardari said that the achievement reflected “national pride, professional excellence, and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to regional peace and maritime security”.
 






The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons.
 






The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020.
PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously.
In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire.
In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:01</small></div><hr>
