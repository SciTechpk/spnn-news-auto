Saqib was recently appointed as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan’s crypto markets.
He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.
“Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,” said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.
“I’m not just here as a minister,” he said. “I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”
 






In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.”
He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.
He revealed that the government had allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.
The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the “largest and most active freelancer economies in the world”.
It added that Saqib was leading the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) — a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.
“Both Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,” Saqib declared. “But if you look past the headlines, you’ll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.”
He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. “If you’re building something real — come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.”
During his keynote, Saqib delivered a “blueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,” the statement concluded.
On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a National Crypto Council to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it appointed Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the council’s CEO.
According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
 
 

Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.
Furthermore, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.
According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p><small>2025-05-29 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29115725d412f66.jpg?r=115733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913934/khyber-medical-university-fires-officer-expels-student-in-harassment-case' target='_blank'><strong>Khyber Medical University fires officer, expels student in harassment case</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Medical University has terminated the services of a senior officer and expelled a student on recommendations of its harassment committee.
According to a press release issued on Wednesday, a formal complaint was received by the KMU Vice-Chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq regarding a harassment incident inside an examination hall on May 18.
The harassment committee investigated the matter and listened to the complainant as well as the alleged harassers to ensure due process, it said.
Following the committee’s findings, KMU’s administration took disciplinary actions, terminating a grade-18 officer, with nearly 17 years of service, from his position. The student involved in the incident was expelled from the university and barred from any future enrolment at KMU, the release said.
 
 

In the last two years, the varsity has consistently upheld its zero-tolerance policy against harassment by taking strict action, including major to minor penalties, against perpetrators.
The university remains resolute in its mission to provide a safe and dignified space for all students, faculty, and staff.

It termed the incident “regrettable and a cause of public unrest” and called for legal action against those responsible.
In a statement, the JPPA leaders said public cooperation was vital for maintaining peace in the region and such incidents risked eroding the trust of local youth and civilians.
They said that ensuring public safety and security was the foremost responsibility of the state and all relevant institutions should play a constructive role in that respect.
The alliance leaders insisted that at times, extraordinary measures taken under the pretext of security could inadvertently affect innocent civilians.
 
 

They urged law-enforcement agencies to adopt strategies that were both effective and community-friendly to restore peace and rebuild public confidence.
The JPPA leaders announced they’re committed to pursuing peace and protecting people’s rights through constitutional and democratic means.
They demanded justice for the victims of the “quadcopter strike” and said trust-building measures should be taken to create a peaceful environment in the region.
The JPPA leaders noted that several peaceful options were under consideration — including public consultations, awareness campaigns and peaceful protests — to raise these concerns through legitimate and non-violent avenues.
They urged all institutions to work collaboratively for lasting peace and well-being of the residents.
The alleged quadcopter reportedly injured 22 youth, children and elderly people, with two being shifted to Dera Ismail Khan due to critical condition.
In a statement, security forces denied social media reports regarding the quadcopter strike in the Azam Warsak area, declaring them “completely false and fabricated.”
According to them, no “quadcopter munition dropped” in the area.
However, a limited security operation was conducted nearby against elements associated with a banned extremist group, leading to an exchange of gunfire. A few individuals reportedly sustained minor injuries during the operation.
The security forces dismissed the claims about large-scale civilian casualties or injury to 22 children as “baseless and inflammatory propaganda aimed at spreading fear and confusion among the public.”
Authorities urged people not to “rely on unverified social media content or fabricated documents” and said citizens should trust only verified sources and official statements issued by the relevant state institutions.

The encounter occurred in Hussain Kot village, located on the outskirts of Rawalakot in Poonch district, following intelligence reports that a group of militants, allegedly led by a man named Zarnosh Na­sim, was hiding in the area.
The operation was set in motion following the April 10 arrest of a suspect, Muiz, a resident of Chak Dhamni near Rawalakot. Muiz, who was found in possession of arms and ammunition, disclosed during interrogation that he was an associate of Zarnosh, a resident of Bagh district, and had delivered weapons to him just a day earlier.
Based on his information, a joint police team from Poonch and Bagh districts launched a raid in the Petaratta Morh area of Bagh on April 11. However, the suspects reportedly opened fire during the operation, resulting in the death of a passerby and injuries to two constables.
On Wednesday, acting on fresh intelligence, police launched another operation in the forested area near Hussain Kot. Upon arrival, the raiding party came under heavy fire and grenade attacks from the suspects.
Two constables were martyred while at least five others were reported injured in the exchange of fire. In retaliatory fire, police gunned down four militants, including Zarnosh.
There were unconfirmed reports suggesting that the militants may have detonated suicide jackets.

At a meeting, members of the Refugees Working Committee — including heads of refugee camps and elected councillors — urged the government to fulfil their long-ignored demand for two reserved seats in the Legislative Assembly, one each for refugees from occupied Jammu and the occupied Valley, ahead of the general elections due next year.
They also demanded an increase in the monthly subsistence allowance and allocation of funds for their resettlement in the 2025-26 budget.
The participants strongly condemned what they called the persistent neglect of the 1989 refugees by successive AJK governments.
“It is deeply unfortunate that even after three and a half decades, the condition of Kashmiri refugees remains unchanged,” read a joint communiqué issued after the meeting.
 
 

According to the communiqué, over 9,500 refugee families — comprising around 46,000 individuals — continued to live in miserable conditions in camps and rented accommodations across Mirpur, Kotli, Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Jhelum Valley, and other cities of AJK.
The participants recalled that a comprehensive ‘Charter of Demands’ was submitted to the AJK government some 18 months ago, and among its key points were proposals for resettlement, resolution of other chronic issues, as well as allocation of one Assembly seat each for refugees from occupied Jammu and the Valley. However, they lamented that no action had been taken on the document to date.
“Refugees will no longer tolerate exploitation, nor will there be any compromise on the future of our younger generation,” the communiqué warned.
The group stressed that allocation of two separate seats for post-1989 refugees would help them elect their own representatives to advocate their concerns and contribute meaningfully to the discourse on India’s human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.
The refugees also reminded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of the commitments he made during previous meetings. These included a Rs1,500 increase in the monthly subsistence allowance and concrete steps towards their resettlement.
The group communiqué congratulated the government of Pakistan, the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir on the success of Operation Bunyanum  Marsoos against Indian aggression.
Published in Dawn, May 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-29 05:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/291031058bbbc98.jpg?r=103113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913987/clerics-warn-president-against-signing-child-marriage-bill' target='_blank'><strong>Clerics warn president against signing child marriage bill</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A day after the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) declared the bill banning child marriages un-Islamic, many clerics from different schools of thought have appealed to President Asif Ali Zardari not to sign the bill into law.
The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025, which seeks to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, reached the presidency on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the CII ruling that classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.
CII member Maulana Jalaludin, who belongs to JUI-F, said Presi­dent Zardari should prevent anarchy in society and not sign the bill.

Controversy deepens as Sharmila cites Shariat court’s ruling; Sherry urges CII to reconsider its opinion

Incidentally, members bel­ong­ing to different sects opposed the bill.
 
 

Responding to a query, the CII member said the assembly could not be above Quran and Sunnah. “This bill is not only against the norms of Sharia but also contrary to the values of our society and our traditions,” Maulana Jalaluddin reasoned, terming the move a western conspiracy to destroy ‘family system’.
The ‘bad intentions’ were evident as the bill was not forwarded to the CII, but approved by parliament ‘in secrecy’, he said.
However, PPP MNA Sharmila Faruqi, who tabled the bill in the National Assembly, said the matter of marriage of girls below 18 years of age, should not be given a religious colour and instead be considered in the context of human rights.
“We are not against marriages. We say marrying girls as young as 13 or 14 years is unfair when girls under 18 years of age do not have right to vote, cannot obtain national identity cards and driving licence,” she added.
In this regard, the PPP lawmaker referred to a decision by Federal Shariat Court of 2022 that allowed the state to set the marriage age.
In its 242nd meeting, the CII also rejected the recommendation of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony regarding mandatory thalassemia testing prior to marriage. The CII was of the opinion that testing should not be made compulsory.
CII urged to review matter
Senator Sherry Rehman told Dawn the CII should reconsider their views in the wake of the Shariat Court stance and the practice in many Muslim countries, which adhere to the age of 18 years for maturity.
The issue sparked a controversy after a fiery speech by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in the National Assembly stating that the bill should be stopped right there, while it was being approved by Senate.
He asked parliament to forward the bill to the CII, as per suggestion of JUI-F lawmaker Kamran Murtaza, warning that failing to do so would undermine the nation’s unity and solidarity.
Most senators, including from PTI, voted that the bill be moved in the upper house by Ms Rehman for approval instead of being forwarded to the CII.

We can never be the same afterwards … and it’s very painful,” lamented Nida Javed while talking to a private news channel.
She was discussing the reaction to her videos, which had gone viral on social media. The videos were recorded by cops inside a police station after she was arrested on April 4, from what police described as an illegal rave party in Kasur. Javed, a social media influencer, claimed it was a music concert.
The 55 men and women arrested from the event were brought to the Mustafabad police station, where videos were recorded with their faces clearly visible and uploaded to social media.
Faced with criticism over the unlawful action, Kasur District Police Officer Essa Khan Sukhera suspended five cops for allegedly filming and posting the videos. At least one of the suspended personnel was also accused of tipping off the organisers about the raid and allowing them to escape.
The incident subsequently drew the ire of the Lahore High Court, which reprimanded the police for violating the law and sought a report from the Punjab police chief regarding the force’s use of social media.
Common practice
Punjab Police rules explicitly prohibit officers from recording videos that might reveal the identity of suspects and under-trial prisoners.
In 2020, Punjab Police issued a policy for the use of social media by its officers. “No police personnel shall share anything in violation of the legal provisions dictating the anonymity of arrested accused, anonymity of police personnel involved in a police operation or investigation and confidentiality of investigations,” the policy states.
Despite clear guidelines, videos of accused and suspects are recorded in police stations across Punjab with their faces clearly visible.

An analysis by Dawn found that while these videos are not posted to official social media accounts, they still find their way online, often uploaded by anonymous accounts, local crime reporters and small news outlets.
Dawn found several videos online which were recorded inside police stations prominently featuring local police officers alongside the suspects, whose faces were clearly identifiable.
More than 50 such videos have been posted to multiple TikTok accounts and Facebook pages since 2021. These videos were reportedly recorded inside police stations in Rawalpindi, Attock, Mailsi, Hattian, Sialkot, Lahore, Fateh Jung, Vehari, Kahror Pakka, Nankana Sahib, Jhelum, Sahiwal, Gujar Khan and Sargodha.
A Punjab Police spokesperson told Dawn that the department has a strict policy against recording interviews and videos of under-trial prisoners.
“We don’t allow interviews of under-trial prisoners,” said Syed Mubashar Hussain of the department’s Directorate of Public Relations.
He said any officer who violates this policy faces departmental action.
‘Nexus’
Lawyers and crime reporters told Dawn that these videos are recorded by police officers and then disseminated for personal projection.
Two Lahore-based crime reporters, who wished not to be named since they regularly seek information from the police, said station-level officials — constables and SHOs — usually record and circulate these videos “to showcase their performance and garner public support for their actions”.
A crime reporter who shared several videos of accused persons recorded inside police stations on TikTok told Dawn that they “receive press releases from police” which they post online.
“When police arrest a gang, they especially request us [for coverage].”

According to Advocate Vishal Ahmed Shakir, there is a nexus between police officers and reporters, where either the cops call reporters for their own publicity or the reporters pay police officials to record interviews of under-custody prisoners.
In 2023, Shakir filed a public interest litigation in the LHC against the airing of interviews of inmates in custody.
Justice Ali Zia Bajwa, who heard the petition, ordered the police not to facilitate actions that violated the right to privacy, dignity and respect of citizens.
Procedural violations
Tariq Khosa, a former top police officer, said these videos not only violate the law but also orders issued by provincial police chiefs.
However, the procedural violations do not begin with the recording of these videos. According to Mr Khosa, in most cases, suspects are arrested without due process.
“No person can be arrested unless enough evidence is available on record. An arrest can’t be made on a mere report without investigation or verification,” said Mr Khosa, who has served as the Balochistan inspector general of Police and FIA director-general.
Even after the arrest, he pointed out, videos of suspects can only be recorded during interrogation to submit as evidence in court. Those videos too have to be recorded in the presence of a witness — a second police officer or any other person — and with the suspect’s consent.
 


Shakir, the advocate, said these videos have a detrimental impact on trials. An accused, during an interview, may confess to the crime out of fear of torture by police, but during their testimony before a judge, they retract the confession, citing duress.
‘Harm to dignity’
Most videos posted on social media included suspects arrested for gambling, flying kites, smoking sheesha and prostitution — crimes that infrequently result in conviction, according to Shakir.
He cited the example of the Kasur incident, where the arrested men and women were released by the court on the first hearing.
“Reason being the process wasn’t correct, recoveries weren’t correct, and their [the accused’s] statements weren’t recorded,” he said, citing procedural lapses, an assertion denied by the police.
At least 27 videos seen by Dawn included women suspects with their faces clearly visible. The men and women were said to be arrested during alleged raids on parties, hotels, brothels and even massage centres and charged with prostitution and obscenity.

These videos put women at greater risk when they go back into society after getting bail or an acquittal, which is the result of 90 per cent of prostitution cases, according to Shakir. He added that most accused are discharged on the first hearing since prostitution can only be proven when there is an exchange of money.
Mr Khosa, the former police chief, also pointed out the weak foundations of these cases. He said police can proceed under Section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (Obscenity) only if an immoral act is done in a public space. In cases involving women, he said, such videos are used for blackmail and extortion. “It is all an ulterior motive.”
For Shakir, these videos cause irreparable damage to a person’s dignity. They also violate Article 14 of the Constitution, which says the dignity of a person is “inviolable”.
He added that courts have repeatedly upheld the notion that an acquittal is akin to never having committed the crime. “These videos mean even after acquittal, my reputation and dignity in society can not be repaired.”

• PTI stresses need for political unity, independent judiciary
ISLAMABAD: A message shared via the official X (formerly Twitter) account of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday called on public to prepare for a countrywide protest movement.
The post came a day after Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, had proposed a ‘give-and-take formula’ for Mr Khan’s release.
Although Mr Khan does not have direct access to his social media account, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has not disclosed who manages his posts.
The latest message, posted in Mr Khan’s name, urged the masses to get ready for a nationwide protest movement, to be launched soon. It also raised concerns about his treatment in Adiala Jail, alleging that he was being denied basic rights.
 
 

“Under jail regulations, I am entitled to a 30-minute meeting with my wife, Bushra Bibi, once a week, but even that has not been allowed for several days,” the post quoted Mr Khan as saying. “Today’s meeting was also scheduled but was not held. Bushra Bibi has been imprisoned for 13 months solely to torment me, despite no crime being proven against her.”
He added, “They can do whatever they want — I will neither bow before their tyranny nor make any deal.”
 






The former premier revealed that he had issued special instructions to Salman Akram Raja for filing a contempt of court petition in the high court against the prison authorities, and simultaneously submit a petition in the Supreme Court over the violation of fundamental human rights.
“All of you should be prepared — a nationwide protest movement will be launched soon,” he said.
‘Nawaz opposed nuclear tests’
Meanwhile, on the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s nuclear tests, Youm-i-Takbeer, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan alleged that then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif was initially unwilling to conduct the nuclear tests, citing negotiations with the United States.
“May 28, 1998, was the day Nawaz Sharif’s legs were trembling,” Mr Ayub claimed. “He had refused to conduct the tests and was negotiating with the US administration to avoid going nuclear.”
Omar Ayub also claimed that Nawaz Sharif was ultimately compelled to authorise the nuclear tests due to significant pressure from key figures within the government and national leadership.
 
 

“My late father, Gohar Ayub Khan, the late Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the late Majeed Nizami, Raja Zafarul Haq, and Sheikh Rashid Ahmad strongly advocated in the cabinet meeting for proceeding with the tests. Their firm stance left the cabinet with no choice but to agree,” he claimed.
“Shehbaz Sharif told my father that Nawaz Sharif was engaging in negotiations with the American president in return for not conducting the nuclear tests,” he said. “My father responded by stating that Pakistan was fully prepared and must proceed.”
He paid tribute to those who played a pivotal role in making Pakistan a declared nuclear state, stating: “We remember and honour the patriots who stood firm in the national interest and safeguarded Pakistan’s strategic future.”
‘India may attack again’
Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that Imran Khan had been continuously warning that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would go for another misadventure.
 
 

At a press conference, he stressed the need for unity among political parties and called for an independent judiciary. “It’s unfortunate that lawyers can predict court decisions even before proceedings begin. This has made Pakistan a global laughing stock,” he said.
Mr Akram said that Pakistan emerged as the first nuclear power in the Islamic world. “It is deeply regrettable that Dr A.Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, was forced to apologise on national television,” he said.
On the current political and judicial crisis, Mr Akram criticised the 26th constitutional amendment, calling it the “burial ground” of the Constitution.

“I got released this morning after being imprisoned for 14 years,” A.T.M. Azharul Islam said, waving at thousands of supporters of the country’s main religious party, Jamaat-i-Islami.
The tight-packed crowd cheered as the senior leader was released from a prison hospital in central Dhaka, a day after the Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and acquitted him of war crimes. “There was no justice in the past… we expect the court will ensure that the people get justice in the coming days,” Islam said.
Leftist parties say they will demonstrate in opposition to his release. Across Ramna Park in the neighbourhood of Naya Paltan, thousands choked the streets as part of a rally in support of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Political parties are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
Protests have become part of daily life in Bangladesh’s capital, with residents either taking part as political parties jostle for power after an uprising last year — or avoiding them.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024, fleeing by helicopter as crowds stormed her palace.
 
 

Hasina’s 15-year-long aut­ho­­ritarian rule contained protests like a pressure cooker, until the student-led movement spearheaded a revolt that toppled her from power. On Wednesday, at least half a dozen demonstrations were held in the sprawling megacity of Dhaka, home to more than 20 million people.
‘Unpredictable’
While tens of thousands gather at major intersections across Dhaka with their demands, others spend hours navigating their way through traffic-snarled streets. “All the major roads are blocked during the day,” chicken seller Zakir Hossain said on Wednesday.
“We’ve had to shift our schedules. I start work at midnight now, even though the law and order situation is worsening every day, and muggings have become common.” It worries many, remembering the violence last year when police tried — and failed — to crush the protests that toppled Hasina.
“The situation is unpredictable — the protests can turn violent at any moment,” said a 43-year-old housewife. “I never used to call my husband much, but now I do. If he is even a little late coming home from the office, all sorts of bad thoughts come to my mind.”
Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has called for parties to build unity and calm intense political power struggles. The government warned on Saturday that  “unreasonable demands” and obstruction had been  “continuously obstructing” its work.
Yunus has said polls could be held as early as December, but that having them later would give the government more time for reform.
Rallies organised by the powerful BNP are calling for the government to set an election date, as well as a raft of other demands, including the sacking of multiple members of Yunus’s cabinet.

“This is not an aspirational goal but a binding obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),” Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wrote in a judgement on a case related to the custody of two children.
Justice Shah emphasised that courts, especially family courts, had a moral and legal responsibility to see, hear and protect every child not as a passive subject of proceedings, but as a rights-bearing individual whose dignity must be safeguarded at every stage of the judicial process.
The proceedings were initially instituted by Dr Sana Sattar (mother) who filed an application for custody of her two children before the senior civil judge (family division), Layyah. While her application was dismissed on July 14, 2023, a visitation schedule was framed to facilitate meetings between her and her children.

Review petition by father of two children dismissed

Both parents, however, filed separate appeals before the court of additional district judge, Layyah, which granted children’s custody to their mother and ordered a visitation arrangement for their father, Dr Muhammad Asif.
 
 

The father then filed a constitutional petition before the Multan bench of Lahore High Court, which got dismissed on May 24, 2024. Later, an appeal before the apex court met the same fate on July 18.
Subsequently, the father moved a review petition before the Supreme Court. A two-member bench comprising Justice Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi heard the matter and maintained that the custody stands vested with the mother.
While dismissing the review petition, the court also directed the parties to strictly adhere to the visitation schedule determined by the lower appellate court though the custody of the children would continue with the mother unless and until the father moves “a fresh application for custody to be adjudicated by a competent forum in light of any material change in circumstances”.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Shah explained that the best interests of the children, particularly the child with special needs, were best served by keeping them in the custody of their mother. No alternative caregiver can fully replicate the intuitive care, emotional constancy, and protective environment a mother is uniquely positioned to offer, the judgement emphasised, adding that even a working professional mother does not detract from her suitability as a custodial parent. On the contrary, it reflects her resilience and her commitment to providing a secure, nurturing, and dignified upbringing for her children.
The judgment asked the courts to adopt a child-friendly, participatory approach while underscoring the need that courts should deal with cases involving children through the lens of a dedicated child-centered and child justice framework, a judicial philosophy grounded in both legal and moral obligations to safeguard, nurture and empower children within the justice system.
The concept of child justice is broad and inclusive. It encompasses not only children in conflict with the law, requires rehabilitative and restorative processes rather than punitive sanctions, but children involved in custody and guardianship disputes must be treated with dignity, heard, protected, and empowered throughout judicial proceedings, the judgment emphasised.
Courts bear a heightened responsibility to prioritise the best interests of child in all decisions affecting them. This principle demands that the judiciary transcend procedural formalism and engage substantively with each child’s unique vulnerabilities, developmental needs and future potential.

• Pakistan buffeted by deadly winds following an intense heatwave last week
GENEVA: The United Nations warned on Wednesday that there is a 70 per cent chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 would exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius international benchmark.
The planet is therefore expected to remain at historic levels of warming after the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024, according to an annual climate report published by the World Meteorological Organisation, the UN’s weather and climate agency.
“We have just experienced the 10 warmest years on record,” said the WMO’s deputy secretary-general Ko Barrett.
“Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.”
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels — and to pursue efforts to peg it at 1.5C.
The targets are calculated relative to the 1850-1900 average, before humanity began industrially burning coal, oil and gas, which emit carbon dioxide (CO2) — the greenhouse gas largely responsible for climate change.
The more optimistic 1.5C target is one that growing numbers of climate scientists now consider impossible to achieve, as CO2 emissions are still increasing.
Five-year outlook
The WMO’s latest projections are compiled by Britain’s Met Office national weather service, based on forecasts from multiple global centres.
The agency forecasts that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be between 1.2C and 1.9C above the pre-industrial average. It says there is a 70pc chance that average warming across the 2025-2029 period will exceed 1.5C.
 
 

“This is entirely consistent with our proximity to passing 1.5C on a long-term basis in the late 2020s or early 2030s,” said Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group at the University of Maynooth.
“I would expect in two to three years this probability to be 100 percent” in the five-year outlook, he added.
The WMO says there is an 80pc chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the current warmest year on record: 2024.
Longer-term outlook
To smooth out natural climate variations, several methods assess long-term warming, the WMO’s climate services director Christopher Hewitt told a press conference.
One approach combines observations from the past 10 years with projections for the next decade (2015-2034). With this method, the estimated current warming is 1.44C.
There is no consensus yet on how best to assess long-term warming.
The EU’s climate monitor Copernicus believes that warming currently stands at 1.39C, and projects 1.5C could be reached in mid-2029 or sooner.
Although “exceptionally unlikely” at one percent, there is now an above-zero chance of at least one year in the next five exceeding 2C of warming.
“It’s the first time we’ve ever seen such an event in our computer predictions,” said the Met Office’s Adam Scaife.
“It is shocking” and “that probability is going to rise”.
He recalled that a decade ago, forecasts first showed the very low probability of a calendar year exceeding the 1.5C benchmark. But that came to pass in 2024.
‘Dangerous’ level of warming
Every fraction of a degree of additional warming can intensify heatwaves, extreme precipitation, droughts, and the melting of ice caps, sea ice and glaciers.
This year’s climate is offering no respite.
Last week, China recorded temperatures exceeding 40C (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas, the United Arab Emirates hit nearly 52C (126F), and Pakistan was buffeted by deadly winds following an intense heatwave.
“We’ve already hit a dangerous level of warming,” with recent “deadly floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China and Ghana, wildfires in Canada,” said climatologist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London. “Relying on oil, gas and coal in 2025 is total lunacy.”
 
 

Davide Faranda, from France’s CNRS National Centre for Scientific Research, added: “The science is unequivocal: to have any hope of staying within a safe climate window, we must urgently cut fossil fuel emissions and accelerate the transition to clean energy.”
Arctic warming is predicted to continue to outstrip the global average over the next five years, said the WMO.
Sea ice predictions for 2025-2029 suggest further reductions in the Barents Sea, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk.
Forecasts suggest South Asia will be wetter than average across the next five years.
And precipitation patterns suggest wetter than average conditions in the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska and northern Siberia, and drier than average conditions over the Amazon.

“I am delighted that the letter of intent signed today could open up a new perspective with new orders for Rafales, Scorpenes, light frigates,” Macron said at a joint press conference alongside Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Prabowo said France was one of Indonesia’s main partners as it upgrades its military hardware and develops its defence industry through joint production and technology transfers.
Macron arrived in Jakarta from Vietnam on Tuesday night on the second leg of his Southeast Asia tour. The French president is scheduled to fly to Singapore on Thursday.

Two countries sign agreements, MoUs worth $11bn

Dassault Aviation shares were up 3.4 per cent in the morning session in Paris. The jets’ performance came under scrutiny last month after reports that Rafales used by the Indian air force were shot down by Pakistan’s Chinese-made jets in clashes.
 
 

Indonesia has yet to receive any of the Rafale jets from the 2022 deal. The chief of the Indonesian Air Force Mohamad Tonny Harjono said in February that six jets would arrive in early 2026, state news agency Antara reported.
Aside from the Rafale deal, Indonesia in 2024 struck an agreement with French state-owned shipyard Naval Group to buy two “Scorpene” submarines, and in 2023 announced the purchase of 13 long-range air surveillance radars from France’s Thales.
Agreements, MoUs
France and mineral-rich Indon­esia also signed a host of other agreements and more than 20 MoUs worth at least $11 billion, said Indonesia’s chief economic minister at a business forum.
The MoUs included one on cooperation between French mining company Eramet and Indonesian sovereign wealth funds Danantara and Indonesia Investment Authority (INA).
The agreement aims to “explore the establishment of a strategic investment platform in the nickel sector, spanning upstream to downstream operations,” Eramet, Danantara and INA said in a joint statement.
The partnership aims to develop the raw materials needed for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the statement said a preliminary assessment will be made to identify projects.

The understanding was reached during a meeting in Tehran between Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi and his Ira­nian counterpart, Eska­ndar Momeni. The discussions focused particularly on the movement and welfare of pilgrims, the ministry said.
According to an official statement, Mr Momeni said the Iranian government “will provide boarding and lodging facilities in Mashhad for 5,000 Pakistani pilgrims”. Also, Iran “will make special arrangements from the border to Iraq for them,” he said, adding that serving the pilgrims is considered a “religious duty”.
Both countries also agreed to establish a hotline to resolve issues concerning pilgrims swiftly. A trilateral conference of the interior ministries of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq will be convened in Mashhad before Arbaeen to discuss matters related to Pakistani pilgrims. The ministers also agreed to increase the number of flights to ensure pilgrim’s safety and convenience.
 






Discussions also included sending pilgrims via sea routes to Iran and Iraq. Furthermore, the leaders talked about strengthening Pakistan-Iran relations and mutual cooperation in various fields, including curbing illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug control, with an agreement to enhance coordination for better border security management.
The Iranian interior minister emphasised that Iran and Pakistan enjoy “excellent relations” and that “Pakistan’s security is of utmost importance to Iran”.
Talks also covered the release of Iranian fishermen detained after they unintentionally entered Pakistani territorial waters. Mr Naqvi assured full cooperation in this regard at the request of his Iranian counterpart.
He expressed gratitude to the Iranian government for facilitating the pilgrims and said the establishment of a hotline would “help resolve issues promptly.”
Attending from the Iranian side were Deputy Interior Minister Ali Akbar Pourjamshidian, Deputy Minister Nader Yar Ahmadi, Adviser Hadian, Governor General of Sistan and Baluchestan Mansour Bager, and Colonel Javaheri, Head of International Affairs at the Ministry of Interior.
FIA director general and senior officers from Pakistan also attended the meeting.

No wonder the world is moving fast towards a cash-free, contactless economy due to its advantages. The migration to a cash-free economy has picked up pace worldwide since the Covid pandemic. Seen in this context, the finance minister’s push for a cashless economy must be supported.
 
 

A media report quotes him as saying that “moving towards a cashless economy is not simply a policy aspiration but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth”.
On Tuesday, he hinted at introducing measures in the next budget to implement compulsory use of digital payments in order to maximise cashless economy and increase documented transactions. The idea is to encourage digitisation of the economy to “shift tax burden away from salaried individuals and compliant businesses to untaxed and under-taxed sectors”.
The authorities plan to push the financial digitisation agenda by incentivising digital transactions and punishing cash transactions through additional tax measures besides blocking cash payments in certain yet-to-be identified critical sectors. A host of measures are believed to have been finalised for inclusion in the budget to “accelerate transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy”.
With the digital-first system, Raast, for real-time payments between individuals, businesses and government entities already in place, the authorities rightly believe that digital payment infrastructure is widely available and accessible across various sectors of the economy: retail, services, public sector, etc for migration from cash to cashless economy. We have seen a dramatic increase in electronic transactions in the last few years, with more and more people turning to digital transactions.
Not only that, even small vendors are adopting alternative forms of payment: instant payments, digital wallets and QR payments, especially in the urban areas. Given the increasing popularity of contactless digital payments, many of us may assume that we are becoming a cashless society. Far from it.
Besides cultural issues and the fear that the government is monitoring digital payment data impeding early adoption of digital-only transactions, the poor broadband and mobile connectivity across many areas remains a major challenge in expanding electronic transactions. For many, cybersecurity issues are a worry — not without justification though.
On top of that the vast majority of the population, especially women and residents of the rural areas, remain unbanked and unable to access the facility. This means the government would have to work in different areas to create an ecosystem for digital transactions before we can actually hope to become a cashless economy.

“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote on his social media platform X.
“The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” he added.
 






The South African-born tech tycoon had said Trump’s bill would increase the deficit and undermine the work of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has fired tens of thousands of people.
Musk — who was a constant presence at Trump’s side before pulling back to focus on his Space X and Tesla businesses — also complained that DOGE had become a “whipping boy” for dissatisfaction with the administration.
“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said in an interview with CBS News, an excerpt of which aired late Tuesday.
Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — which passed the US House last week and now moves to the Senate — offers sprawling tax relief and spending cuts and is the centrepiece of his domestic agenda.
But critics warn it will decimate health care and balloon the national deficit by as much as $4 trillion over a decade.
“A bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday.
The White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk.
“The Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget bill,” Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk’s social network, X, after the tech titan’s comments aired.
All DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added.
 






But Musk’s comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign.
‘Whipping boy’
Trump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostly stepping back to run his companies again.
Musk complained in a separate interview with the Washington Post that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism.
“DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of Space X’s latest launch on Tuesday.
“Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.”
Musk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE’s failure to achieve all of its goals — although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors.
“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he said. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”
Musk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down.
Musk’s own businesses suffered in the meantime.
Protesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm’s profits slumped.
“People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That’s really uncool,” Musk told the Post.
Musk has also been focusing on Space X after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars — the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starship exploded over the Indian Ocean.
The tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.</p><small>2025-05-29 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/282245562f8b09c.png?r=224607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913882/amnesty-4-other-groups-call-on-pakistan-to-end-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty, 4 other groups call on Pakistan to end crackdown on human rights defenders in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Amnesty International and four other human rights organisations called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent, according to Amnesty’s website.
Last week, the Balochistan High Court rejected constitutional petitions seeking the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) Chief Organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch and two other leaders detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO). The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang and other BYC activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
A letter dated May 27 was addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and signed by Amnesty, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia), Front Line Defenders (FLD), the International Federation for Human Rights, and the World Organisation Against Torture, both of which work under the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
 






The groups said late on Tuesday night they strongly condemned the alleged “harassment and arbitrary detention of Baloch human rights defenders exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan.”
“The actions of your government to systematically harass and detain HRDs, raising their voice against enforced disappearances and other unlawful state practices, run afoul of Pakistan’s international human rights obligations,” the letter alleged.
It added that the “attacks on BYC leaders and supporters, who are peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly, not only violate Pakistan’s constitution but also its international legal obligations.”
The letter noted that the Pakistani Constitution guarantees the right to assemble
peacefully under Article 16 and the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19.
The groups further alleged in the letter that the crackdown was launched “against a backdrop of harassment of journalists and a clampdown on freedom of expression.”
“It is imperative that human rights are upheld and never sacrificed in the name of security,” the letter said.
The organisations called on Pakistan to “immediately and unconditionally release all Baloch HRDs and their family members arbitrarily detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights in line with the right to liberty and safety.” They further urged Islamabad to “drop all charges against HRDs based solely on the exercise of their rights.
“Pending their release, ensure the safety of HRDs and family members, including by sharing accurate information about their whereabouts, and providing effective access to family members, legal counsel and medical treatment.
They called on Pakistan to “conduct a thorough, impartial, effective and transparent investigation into the allegations of torture and mistreatment by Pakistani authorities of Baloch HRDs under detention.”
The organisations also urged an end to the crackdown against HRDs, journalists, protesters and dissidents by ensuring their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully protected.
They further called on Pakistani authorities to “cease all forms” of alleged reprisals against family members of HRDs.“</p><small>2025-05-29 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6837c8ce64cc4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914010/fictitious-assets' target='_blank'><strong>Fictitious assets</strong></a><br><p>SOME sort of a crypto bug seems to have gripped the government and perhaps some of it is warranted.
From the details reported in the international media we learn that at least some of the efforts of the Pakistani government in the crypto domain are geared towards procuring influence in Washington DC, with those close to the Trump administration coming to Pakistan for crypto-related discussions.
To that extent we can look at what is happening and say “it is what it is” and leave it at that. But the moment the government begins to take crypto seriously as a business proposition it becomes dangerous. And it is important to keep this distinction in mind, between crypto as an influence peddling tool versus a serious business proposition, because the resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.
In the past few weeks, since the Crypto Council was announced by the government, we have seen suggestions appear in print on how Pakistan can expand its participation in the wider world of cryptocurrencies. One suggestion was to place a portion of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in crypto, and the individual making this suggestion deployed a classic tactic used by small-time stock brokers or real estate agents selling junk to gullible clients. He pointed to the rise in the value of Bitcoin over the past decade, and asked the reader to imagine if Pakistan had placed a certain amount of its reserves in this asset, how much that value would have multiplied by today.
What was not mentioned in the article was the sheer volatility of currency over that same time period. Sovereign reserves are never gambled with in volatile assets. They are, as a rule, always invested in fixed-income instruments. It’s the same principle when managing pension funds or other institutional savings. The principles are low-volatility, low-risk, fixed return.

The resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.

Another argument encouraged the state to go into crypto mining by offering the right “incentives”. The right incentives apparently include providing them with electricity at around five to six cents per unit. For comparison consider that you and I pay somewhere around 20 cents per unit for our electricity, with industry somewhere around 14 cents. The most obvious question to ask when considering this proposition is this: if Pakistan has electricity to give at five cents per unit, why should crypto miners be the first to get it?
A puzzling press release from the finance ministry a few days ago added to the confusion. It announced that the government has “allocated” 2000MW for crypto mining. It was puzzling because there was no mention of price (the single most important thing to mention in such an announcement), but more importantly, there is literally no such thing as electricity allocations in Pakistan. There are no quotas of who gets how much electricity. So what exactly is being announced in this press release?
The third suggestion that has been floated is to create on-shore crypto exchanges in Pakistan, much like we already have a commodities exchange. This is probably the most benign of the suggestions since all it does is make crypto trading a regulated activity without putting any state resources into play.
It is critical to keep in mind that crypto is a fictitious asset. It is not the first, nor the last of these. Fictitious assets are those that exist only in the mind of the holder. If enough people buy into the fiction they can become liquid, meaning you can trade them for real goods and services. Money, for example, is a fictitious asset as is gold. But both are highly liquid. I can pay my bills with money, buy my groceries, because almost everyone in my society buys into the fiction that money (or gold) represent.
Not so with crypto. This is purely a speculative asset, created for speculative purposes, given prominence by speculator interests, and currently in the process of being pumped by a massive speculative scheme being launched by the White House itself. This endows it with a great deal of speculative value. But none of it is real.
In the past we have seen fictitious assets grow to unmanageable proportions and pose risks to the entire global financial system. Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) were fictitious assets when left unregulated, because those creating them were able to bundle junk mortgages by illiquid borrowers into their offering and sell them as a AAA-rated financial product. This scam became so large in the late 2000s that it lay at the root of the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression.
CDOs are still around, but as a regulated product they now pose little risk of growing into a threat to the financial order. But speculator capital has its own ingenuity. Think of plot files being sold by unscrupulous property developers, in housing projects they haven’t even begun acquiring land for yet. That is a fictitious asset, and trading in it brings enormous risks that should not be taken by retail investors or those entrusted to manage the wealth of others, such as sovereigns or pension fund managers.
Fictitious assets have always been around in the modern world. The South Sea Bubble in the early 18th century was created by massive investments in the stock of a company that had no prospects of actually being able to do the business it was supposed to do (sell slaves to the Spanish colonies of South America). They are around in our time too and crypto is just one of their manifestations. It’s fine for those who wish to trade in these sorts of fictitious assets with their own money. But the state should beware the wiles with which the salesmen of this snake oil try to lure you into their racket.

• Proposed bill faces criticism from both treasury, opposition benches
LAHORE: The Punjab civil bureaucracy is facing mounting criticism for its repeated failure to come up with a local government law acceptable to both the treasury and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), let alone the opposition.
Since the expiry of the last local government term in December 2021, the bureaucracy has prepared the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) at least four times. However, none of the drafts have passed legislative scrutiny or gained political consensus.
Irritated over the continuous delay in finalising the PLGA, the Election Commission has summoned the Punjab chief secretary and the administrative secretary of the Local Government and Community Development Department (LG&CD) in person on Thursday (today).
The PLGA, prepared by the civil bureaucracy, had drawn strong criticism from the treasury benches as they said it would “bury local governments”. The opposition has gone further, denouncing the bill as a throwback to the authoritarian policies of military rulers Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.
Treasury lawmaker Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah warned that the proposed bill would disempower elected representatives by centralising authority in the hands of deputy commissioners. Another treasury member, Ahmad Iqbal, said the new bill would dismantle local governance.
In a notice addressed to the chief secretary and the LG&CD secretary over delay in conducting local government elections in Punjab, the ECP stated that the term of the local government in Punjab had expired on Dec 31, 2021. Since then, the ECP said it had undertaken several initiatives to facilitate the timely conduct of local government elections in the province, including convening meetings, issuing correspondence and sending reminders.
The Election Commission said it was on record that the Punjab local government laws had undergone amendments on four separate occasions and the commission had accordingly conducted the delimitation process several times.
Most recently, the ongoing delimitation process for union councils was suspended on the request of the Punjab government to allow for the finalisation of the Punjab Local Government Bill, 2025. It said the commission accepted this request and granted a four-week extension, with a clear directive that “no further extensions would be entertained”.
Subsequently, the ECP in its notice stated that the draft of the PLGA was shared with the commission on Dec 26 last year. The commission reviewed the draft and communicated its feedback to the Punjab government on Jan 23 this year.
“A full bench hearing of the commission was held on Feb 26, during which instructions were issued to the Punjab chief secretary to finalise the legislative process. However, no substantial progress has been reported by the Punjab government [to date] regarding the enactment of the requisite legislation or the conduct of local government elections,” it said.
Consequently, the ECP has summoned the chief secretary, as well as LG&CD secretary, to appear in person before the commission on Thur­sday at its Islamabad secretariat.
‘Colonial mindset’
Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar told Dawn that the civil bureaucracy had proposed non-party elections in the Punjab local government bill, reflecting dictators Ziaul Haq and Gen Musharraf’s colonial mindset.
It proposed all powers rested with the respective deputy commissioners instead of elected representatives. “The government wants all those elected be brought into the ruling party fold through incentives or pressure,” he alleged.
He said the bill proposed that the union councils’ elections would be held on a non-party basis, and the elected members would choose chairpersons of the union and district councils from among themselves instead of the chairperson’s direct election.
He claimed the design was motivated by fears that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) might sweep the polls if held on a party basis. He added that the opposition would suggest amendments and oppose the existing proposed bill tooth and nail.
In the proposed bill, Mr Bhachar said, the government was trying to wind up the Panchayat system, which was highly important in most parts of the province.
The opposition leader said the incumbent Punjab dispensation, which he said was “no less than a martial law government”, should have advertised the proposed law and sought public opinion before finalising and presenting it before the Punjab Assembly.
“It will be a sheer wastage of people’s time and money if the Punjab government tries to pass the bill and holds local government elections on a non-party basis, granting powers to deputy commissioners instead of elected representatives,” he added.

Israel stepped up its military offensive in Gaza earlier this month, while mediators push for an end to hostilities that remains elusive.
The issue of aid has come sharply into focus amid a hunger crisis after Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza for over two months, before allowing supplies in at a trickle last week.
“Since the resumption of hostilities in Gaza, the already horrific existence of civilians has only sunk further into the abyss. This is man-made,” Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East, told the Council.

US surgeon says Gaza’s health network has been systematically dismantled in a ‘sustained military campaign’

“Death is their companion,” she continued. “It’s not life, it’s not hope. The people of Gaza deserve more than survival. They deserve a future.”
The aid that is now coming in “is comparable to a lifeboat after the ship has sunk”, she said.
Kaag warned that there could be no “sustainable peace” in the Middle East without a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, adding that the occupied West Bank also is on a “dangerous trajectory”. And she called for collective action to revive a two-state solution, saying that a high-level international conference next month presents a “critical opportunity”.
“It must launch a concrete path towards ending the occupation and realising the two-state solution,” she said.
When speaking of people in Gaza, “the words empathy, solidarity and support have lost their meaning”, Kaag said.
“We should not become accustomed to the number of people killed or injured. These are daughters, mothers, and young children whose lives have been shattered. All have a name, all had a future, all had dreams and aspirations.”
`Why didn’t I die?’
The UN Security Council also heard the harrowing testimony of an American surgeon on Wednesday, a few weeks after his return from Gaza.
“I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes, especially to children, and I cannot pretend not to have seen it. You too, cannot claim ignorance,” said Dr Feroze Sidhwa.
The medical system in Gaza has not failed, he said. “It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has wilfully violated international humanitarian law.”
Children are “supposed to be protected”, he said, but “in Gaza, those protections are simply gone”.
“Most of my patients were pre-teen children, their bodies shattered by explosions and torn by flying metal. Many died. Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone,” he said.
“According to the War Child Alliance, nearly half of Gaza’s children are suicidal,” he said.
“They ask, why didn’t I die with my sister, my mother, my father? Not out of extremism, but out of unbearable grief. I wonder if any member of this Council has ever met a five-year-old child who no longer wants to live.” The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed Hamas for the situation in Gaza.
“There is suffering in Gaza, but the blame is on the shoulders of Hamas … so they will continue to be suffering until Hamas understands that they will not stay in Gaza,” he told reporters.
Israel claims killing Sinwar’s brother
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief and younger brother of the Palestinian group’s deceased leader Yahya Sinwar, had been killed in an air strike last week.
Mohammad Sinwar had been the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza and Netanyahu said on May 21 that it was likely he was dead.
The Israeli leader announced that Sinwar had been “eliminated” in an address to the Israeli parliament as he listed off names of other Hamas officials that Israel claimed it had killed over the past 20 months.
“In the last two days we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,” he said, adding that Israel was also “taking control of food distribution”, a reference to the new aid distribution system in Gaza managed by a US-backed group.
Hamas has yet to confirm Sinwar’s death.

Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously with the Dag Hammarskjold medal the two Pakistanis are: Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsan Ullah Khan - both served with UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
During the ceremonies, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will lay a wreath to honour more than 4,400 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948. He will also preside over a ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber, at which Dag Hammarskjöld Medals will be awarded posthumously to 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives serving under the UN flag last year.
Pakistan is the fifth largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 2,800 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Congo, Cyprus, Somalia, South Sudan and Western Sahara. Peacekeeping is one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security.
Since 1948, when the historic decision was made to deploy military observers to the Middle East to supervise the implementation of Israel-Arab Armistice Agreements, in what became the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, more than two million peacekeepers have served in 71 operations around the world.
Today, some 68,000 women and men serve as military, police and civilian personnel in 11 conflict zones across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 119 countries currently contribute uniformed personnel.

The president has upended the country’s reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “Make America Great Again” populist agenda.
He has blocked Harvard from hosting international scholars in a manoeuvre being challenged legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for deportation, and most recently, suspended student visa processing across the board.
Harvard applied mathematics and economics student Abdullah Shahid Sial, 20, said the Trump administration’s campaign against US universities which the president accused of being hotbeds of liberal bias and anti-Semitism, had been “dehumanising”.
 
 

“It’s really unfortunate that this is the case for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds who came here without any family, and in most cases, haven’t been to the US before,” said Sial, who is from Pakistan and hopes to be able to return to Harvard next academic year.
Sial said he advised acquaintances to have backup plans if US colleges became inaccessible, and that a friend applied to Harvard’s law school, as well as Columbia’s, and two less reputable British institutions, ultimately opting to go to the UK.
“He definitely liked Harvard way more [but] he doesn’t want this amount of uncertainty surrounding his education,” Sial said.
Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, said Trump’s move to block the university hosting and enrolling foreign students meant he was unsure if he would be able to return after summer vacation.
‘In the dark’
While that decision — affecting some 27 per cent of the overall Harvard population — was paused by a judge pending a hearing Thursday, the move still threw student plans into chaos.
“I kind of figured I would be in the target group of Trump. I’m personally right in the middle of it, so an option for me would be to study abroad … I have applied to study at Oxford because of all the ‘action’ taken by Trump,” said Molden, 21. “It’s just really hard.”
Harvard academics say they have already started to feel the impact of Trump’s vendetta against the school, in feedback from colleagues based outside the United States.
“I’ve already heard this from professors in other countries who say ‘we encourage our best students to go to the United States’,” Harvard professor Ryan Enos told AFP at a noisy rally against Trump’s policies Tuesday, adding “we wonder if we can tell them that anymore.”
The halt to visa processing revealed this week is reportedly to allow for more stringent screening of applicants’ social media and protest activity.
“International students already represent the most tracked and vetted category of nonimmigrants in the United States. It is a poor use of taxpayer dollars,” said the NAFSA Association of International Educators non-profit.
Trump, meanwhile, continued his assault on Harvard, saying university leaders have “got to behave themselves”.
“Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect, and all they’re doing is getting in deeper and deeper,” he said on Wednesday in the White House.
 


One Spanish student of politics and statistics, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, told AFP she would not be deterred from pursuing her planned year abroad at Columbia University.
“It’s scary, because we think to ourselves that all our activity on social networks could be monitored, for example, if we like pro-Palestinian posts or anti-Trump posts. All of that could see us denied a visa,” she said.
Students due to return to Harvard after the summer break are in limbo pending a ruling on Harvard’s exclusion from the foreign student system.
“I’m completely in the dark,” said 20-year-old Alfred Williamson, a Welsh-Danish physics and government student in his second year at Harvard. “As for my other options, and like all other international students, I’m just clinging on to the hope that Harvard will win this battle against the White House.”
Sial, the Harvard student from Pakistan, said foreign students like him were “made to fight this battle which no one signed up for.” “It’s really unfortunate that it’s come down to that. “</p><small>2025-05-28 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28224226fa4f929.jpg?r=224517' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913893/six-year-old-boy-falls-into-open-manhole-drowns-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Six-year-old boy falls into open manhole, drowns in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A six-year-old boy drowned in an open manhole in Karachi on Wednesday, which triggered a protest by residents and politicians, prompting the police to register a case against unidentified suspects in Jamshed Quarters.
Jamshed Quarters police Station House Officer (SHO) Ansar Butt said, “Two siblings were passing by a petrol pump in the area when one of them fell into an open manhole.
“The victim’s brother alerted bystanders about the incident, where the boy drowned. After being inside the manhole for about 20 minutes, the boy passed away at 7pm on Tuesday.”
The incident angered locals who lodged a protest at the scene, which was joined by MQM-P lawmaker Amir Siddiqi.
Siddiqi told the media, “The Sindh government and Karachi mayor have failed to cover open manholes in the metropolis. A child fell into a 16-foot-deep drain and died.
“The city has been destroyed,” the lawmaker regretted.
Siddiqi told Dawn.com that the protest took place for four hours as the police were delaying the registering of a first information report (FIR). “The police finally registered the FIR when I personally spoke to top police officers, including the Sindh inspector general,” he said, terming the incident “a tragedy for the poor family”.
SHO Butt said the police registered a case against unidentified suspects on the complaint of the victim’s maternal uncle Mohammed Ibrahim under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
One of the residents told Dawn.com that the victim and his 12-year-old brother used to sell french fries in the area.
“They had purchased potatoes and were on their way home when electricity in the area was cut,” the resident said.
“The owner of the nearby petrol pump had opened a car wash, whose operator would leave the manhole open when he washed cars to drain water,” they added. “The manhole was uncovered when one of the boys fell into it due to the darkness.”
The resident said that the protest continued until 1am on Wednesday, when the police, in the presence of Siddiqui, “promised” that they would try to get compensation from the petrol pump owner.
Open manholes have become a persistent hazard across Pakistan, posing serious risks to pedestrians and motorists alike. Despite repeated public complaints, authorities have failed to implement long-term solutions to prevent accidents and fatalities.
In April, the body of a minor girl was found in a drain in Karachi’s Liaquatabad neighbourhood, according to police.
A statement from the police said the minor’s body was recovered from a drain near Siddique Mosque and appeared to be one or two days old. It added that the body was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital to ascertain the cause of death.
Liaquatabad SHO Ghulam Yasin told Dawn.com that the girl’s body was found floating in the drain near Angara Goth.
“It appeared that she was drowned somewhere else and the current of the water brought her there,” he said, adding that she was reported missing within the limits of Sachal Police Station on April 15.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/282320335a4a115.jpg?r=232440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913895/andrew-tate-and-brother-charged-with-rape-uk-prosecutors' target='_blank'><strong>Andrew Tate and brother charged with rape: UK prosecutors</strong></a><br><p>Controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother have been charged with several counts of rape, assault and trafficking, UK prosecutors said on Wednesday.
The accusations, which date back to between 2012 to 2015, were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service in January 2024, but have only been revealed now.
Former kickboxer Tate, 38, faces 10 charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution relating to three women.
His brother, Tristan, 36, has been accused of 11 similar charges against one woman.
“A European arrest warrant was issued in England in 2024, and as a result, the Romanian courts ordered the extradition to the UK of Andrew and Tristan Tate,” prosecutors said in a statement.
“However, the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first.” Andrew Tate is facing legal action in several countries, including some cases where he is accused alongside his brother.
In Romania, the Tate brothers face separate allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.
Both men, who have dual British-US nationality, have denied all charges against them.
 
 

Andrew Tate, the figurehead of the online masculinist movement, travelled to Florida with his brother in February, marking the first time they had left Romania since their 2022 arrest.
Romanian prosecutors allege that the brothers and two women set up a criminal organisation in Romania in 2021 and sexually exploited several victims.
In a separate civil case in the United Kingdom, four British women have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control.
Tate moved to Romania years ago after first starting a webcam business in Britain.
He leapt to fame in 2016 when he appeared on the “Big Brother” UK reality television show, but was removed after a controversial video emerged.
He then turned to social media platforms to promote his often misogynistic and divisive views on how to be successful. Tate is followed by more than 10.7 million people on the social network X, where he shares his angry vision of masculinity and often homophobic and racist posts.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2821032961ede12.png?r=220626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913883/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-meet-on-june-2-sherry' target='_blank'><strong>Delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance on escalation with India to meet on June 2: Sherry</strong></a><br><p>The high-level delegation tasked with presenting Pakistan’s position on the ongoing dispute with India has scheduled to meet on June 2, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
 


Speaking on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, Senator Rehman said that the diplomatic committee had decided to visit various countries before Eidul Azha.
“The committee, headed by Bilawal, will begin its tour of various countries on June 2, starting from New York,” she said.
She added, “The committee will first go to New York, then Washington, followed by London, and then Brussels.”
 
 

Rehman further said that Bilawal had emphasised that there was no hurry as Pakistan “is not concerned with the Indian delegation.”
“Bilawal has said that we have our own stance and that we have enough content for our defence,” she said, adding that the PPP chairman wanted a “substantive [and] quality meeting”.
Speaking about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent remarks regarding the Indus Water Treaty, saying “No politician, especially a PM, says things like that.”
She added that Modi wanted the region to remain in “crisis” to prevent any space for negotiations.
In a separate interview with the Saudi television network Al-Arabiya, the senator warned that stability in a volatile region is not possible with Modi’s escalatory rhetoric.
“He is pushing the region toward a dangerous new abnormal, which cannot possibly be acceptable to anyone,” Senator Rehman said. “Nothing is normal or rational about this doctrinal shift in India’s foreign policy.”
She highlighted that India was also mining more groundwater than any other country in the world, especially from the Indus River Basin, while trying to cut off what they can of Pakistan’s water lifeline, stating that this is “totally unsustainable or acceptable in today’s climate-stressed world”.
 






The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad’s alleged involvement in a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — an allegation for which it provided no evidence.
New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/282215331211353.jpg?r=221601' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913890/in-world-first-mexican-voters-to-elect-all-judges' target='_blank'><strong>In world first, Mexican voters to elect all judges</strong></a><br><p>Mexico is set to become the world’s only country to let voters elect all of their judges, sparking sharp disagreement about whether the reforms will diminish or strengthen criminal influence over the courts.
The government says the unprecedented popular vote for judges and magistrates at all levels — including the Supreme Court — is needed to address rampant corruption and impunity.
Critics argue it will undermine the judiciary’s independence and warn the participation of controversial candidates — such as a former lawyer for notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman — means it is doomed to backfire.
On Sunday, voters will choose several thousand federal, district and local judges and magistrates. Another election for the remainder will be held in 2027.
Not just anybody can run for one of these jobs. Candidates must have a law degree, experience in legal affairs, what is termed “a good reputation,” and no criminal record.
Opponents, including judicial workers, have held a series of mass street protests in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the reforms.
“Justice is not something you vote for”, and it needs people with experience and specialised knowledge, said Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer.
But Maria del Rocio Morales, a judge who is standing to be a magistrate in the capital, said she was happy to take part.
“For the good of my city and my country, I will do it,” she said.
President Claudia Sheinbaum has played down signs that many voters are unlikely to take part in the vote.
“People are very intelligent and know who they are going to vote for,” the veteran left-winger said.
According to surveys by the El Universal and El Pais newspapers, only half of voters know the election date and only four out of 10 are certain they will participate.
‘Rotten’ judiciary
While judicial elections are not new — the United States and Bolivia, for instance, allow voters to pick some judges — Mexico will be the only nation to elect them at all levels.
The reform was championed by Sheinbaum’s predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who criticised the judicial system as “rotten,” corrupt and serving the interests of the political and economic elite.
Mexico has a long history of human rights violations that remain unpunished, including the disappearance of 43 students from a teacher training college in 2014, allegedly at the hands of drug traffickers and corrupt authorities.
Despite dozens of arrests, there have been no convictions.
Mexico’s criminal justice system “is profoundly ineffective at ensuring accountability for criminal violence and abuses by security forces,” according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.
Lopez Obrador frequently clashed with the judiciary, in particular the Supreme Court, which impeded some of his policies.
Sheinbaum, who replaced him in October, is a staunch supporter of the sweeping changes. Her opponents say they will eliminate democratic checks and balances.
Sheinbaum’s ruling party already dominates both houses of Congress.
Opponents warn that elected judges could be more vulnerable to pressure from criminals, in a country where powerful drug cartels regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials.
Rights group Defensorxs has identified around 20 candidates it considers “high risk” for reasons including allegations of cartel links, corruption and sexual abuse, even though one of the requirements for running is to have no criminal record.
These people include Silvia Delgado, a former lawyer for “El Chapo,” the Sinaloa cartel co-founder imprisoned in the United States.
Defensorxs describes her as a candidate who “defends alleged drug traffickers.”
Delgado, who is standing to be a judge in the northern state of Chihuahua, told AFP: “Every person has the right to counsel.”
Another controversial candidate seeking to be a district judge in the northern state of Durango served prison time in the United States for drug crimes, according to Defensorxs.
A major concern for voters is the complexity of a vote that will require people in Mexico City to mark nine ballots for local and federal judges.
“I think even the people who devised it don’t know how to do it,” said Rojas Luviano.</p><small>2025-05-28 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28201023be8f10a.jpg?r=201141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913884/saudi-govt-call-centre-now-offering-support-in-urdu-other-languages-for-haj-pilgrims' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi govt call centre now offering support in Urdu, other languages for Haj pilgrims</strong></a><br><p>The Saudi government on Wednesday announced that its 937 Health Call Centre was now offering multilingual support to Haj pilgrims around the clock, including in Urdu.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
According to a press release from the Saudi Embassy, the call centre “plays a vital role in the Kingdom’s healthcare response during Haj.”
“The centre is designed to enhance access to health services, offer medical guidance, and ensure [a] timely response to emergencies,” the press release read.
“Available 24/7, the centre provides a wide range of services including real-time medical consultations, emergency assistance, handling of complaints, guidance on accessing health facilities, and support in locating missing or hospitalised pilgrims.”
The press release stated that the call centre operates in seven major languages: Urdu, Arabic, English, French, Indonesian, Farsi, and Turkish. This ensures “smooth, responsive, and inclusive service delivery regardless of nationality”, according to the statement.
The Saudi Ministry of Health called on all Haj pilgrims to utilise the services of the call centre, reaffirming it was ready to respond to all inquiries and medical emergencies.
The ministry underscored that these efforts are part of a broader strategy “to uphold the health, safety, and dignity of every pilgrim throughout their sacred journey”.
Last week, the ministry launched a health awareness kit, including one in Urdu, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims.
In a post on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. “In all languages, we care about pilgrims’ health. Explore the health awareness kit to promote health and well-being among pilgrims,” the post said.
 






The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.</p><small>2025-05-28 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/281745043746a05.jpg?r=174523' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913863/pm-shehbaz-reiterates-willingness-to-talk-on-kashmir-terrorism-if-india-wants-in-all-sincerity' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reiterates willingness to talk on Kashmir, terrorism if India ‘wants in all sincerity’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.
The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his tour to friendly countries to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.
Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region […] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”
The premier also touched upon the issue of terrorism: “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.
“But this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz also expressed willingness to resume trade if India was willing to cooperate on the issues, including counterterrorism.
“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table.
“I would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,” he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.
 


On India’s unilateral move to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, the premier said: “India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan — 240 million people — for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.
“I think this is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” he asserted.
 
 

During his address, Shehbaz noted: “The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.
“This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.”
“In today’s unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought.”
Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which “was obviously very serious”. “It was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason.”
He noted Erdogan’s “firm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan”, as well as Aliyev’s unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan“ had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.

The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan’s response, noting the “great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen” of the armed forces under his leadership.
“I saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression.”
 
 

Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.
Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.
“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.
“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”
Noting the “outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan” for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: “We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan’s recent conflict with India.”
He noted that India “not only failed to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a neutral, transparent investigation into the so-called incident in Pahalgam by any international body”.
At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”
He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent decision to disband. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”
Turkiye ready to ‘contribute’ to India-Pakistan peace
Addressing the summit, Erdogan expressed Turkiye’s willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan: “Our hope is that the declared ceasefire will evolve into permanent peace. Turkiye is ready to make every possible contribution to this end.”
Stressing that developments in the region revealed how important “solidarity among our countries is”, Erdogan said: “We are pleased with the ceasefire that ended the tension which erupted between Pakistan and India.
“I once again congratulate our brother Shehbaz and the Pakistani authorities for the calm and prudent attitude they displayed during the process,” he added.
 


“We are three brotherly countries sharing common ideals based on mutual affection, respect and trust nourished by the same climate of civilisation. We are further strengthening the bond among our countries.”
Noting that the three countries collectively had an economic size of $1.5 trillion, the Turkish president said, “We stand behind each and every step towards transforming our relationship into a strategic partnership.”
He noted that their countries were located in a highly strategic region and faced a variety of challenges.
“In the coming period, our foreign ministers will carry out the required work to institutionalise our trilateral cooperation and they will prepare a strong framework that reflects the common vision of our countries,” he said, mentioning the trade, energy, defence and counterterrorism fields.
The president also noted plans to cooperate in transport, education, energy security, food supply security and renewable energy.
Erdogan also slammed Israel’s “relentless cruelty and expansionist policies in Palestine”, terming it the “clearest example of crisis of the international system”. He called for increased global pressure on Israel for a permanent ceasefire and uninterrupted aid into the enclave.

Kicking off the summit, President Aliyev said: “The recent tensions between Pakistan and India had troubled us the most and we watched it very closely in the hope that peace would prevail, and from the early hours we have expressed our solidarity with brotherly Pakistan.
“We would like to see dialogue and negotiations in line with the UN Charter and resolutions; this is the way to move forward in this conflict.”
Aliyev noted that there is great potential for advanced technologies, artificial intelligence, space intelligence and exploration, as well as academic collaborations and cultural events.
“Reinvigorating tourism links will only enhance the ties between our people,” he said.
He also noted that unanimous support for Azerbaijan’s candidature for becoming a full-fledged member of the Developing-8 Organisation for Economic Cooperation. “We express support to brotherly Turkiye and Pakistan.”

As of May 18, a total of 55,865 Afghan nationals including 35,975 ACC holders and 19,890 illegal migrants have left for Afghanistan since April 1, the day the second phase began after the deadline for repatriation of registered Afghan nationals ended on March 31.
The PEN International-led joint statement, signed by freedom of expression and human rights organisations, concerns the recent acceleration in the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including at-risk writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban for their peaceful expression.
 
 

More than a dozen organisations called on the government to “immediately halt the arbitrary mass deportation of Afghan nationals in line with the country’s human rights obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement.
“We urge the international community to continue to provide safety to at-risk Afghans, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others who fled the Taliban’s persecution,” PEN International said.
It noted that the government’s decision to deport Afghan nationals, announced on October 3, 2023, drew “significant concern” from international institutions, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, who urged the government to continue to protect at-risk Afghans.
“Despite the UNHCR’s active non-return advisory for Afghanistan and calls from UN experts to halt the deportations, the government of Pakistan has accelerated its forced returns in recent months, resulting in over 30,000 deportations in April alone,” the statement said.
“Included among those deported who are at greatest risk of persecution are writers, journalists, artists, and human rights defenders who continue to face significant threats of arbitrary arrest, torture and imprisonment for any form of expression that the Taliban deem incompatible with their ideology.
“Women and girls deported to Afghanistan will face overwhelming levels of repression impacting every aspect of their lives, amounting to what UN experts have described as ‘gender apartheid’,” the statement read.
Many of those who fled across the border into Pakistan following the Taliban’s return to de facto rule in August 2021 had planned to travel onwards to a country of safety, PEN International stated
“However, the suspension of humanitarian visa pathways and inadequate support for at-risk Afghans in countries around the world, including the US, the UK and Germany, has left many stranded in a situation of abject precarity and insecurity.”
For the over one million Afghan refugees and asylum seekers who remain in Pakistan, the intensifying crackdown by Pakistani authorities, which includes mass arrests and other forms of harassment, has instilled a renewed sense of fear in a community already blighted by conflict and marginalisation, PEN International emphasised.
“In light of the severe risk posed by the Taliban, the undersigned organisations call on the government of Pakistan to immediately suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’.
“We also call on the international community to ensure safe and legal passage for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and others at risk of persecution for their peaceful expression.
