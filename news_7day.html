<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0508313308187dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965208/un-body-to-help-pakistan-develop-its-energy-transition-plan' target='_blank'><strong>UN body to help Pakistan develop its energy transition plan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) will provide policy advisory and technical support to energy financing to assist Pakistan in the development of its Energy Transition Investment Plan (ETIP).
At the request of the government, a scoping mission of UN-ESCAP visited Pakistan recently, and held talks with ministries concerned and development partners to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities in Pakistan on energy transition financing. The team obtained a deep understanding of entry points to building a strong ETIP and understanding where challenges and opportunities may lie, UN-ESCAP says.
The country’s energy transition is critical for economic resilience, climate commitments, and fiscal stability. Heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, coupled with a circular debt crisis exceeding Rs2.6 trillion, underscores the urgency of shifting to renewables to meet energy needs by 2030. However, challenges like policy inconsistencies, fossil fuel dependency, and limited concessional financing hinder progress.
To bridge this gap, the ETIP can assist Pakistan by working to attract green foreign direct investment and leverage blen­ded finance models that combine public and philanthropic funds to unlock private capital. Concessional funding — including low-interest loans and guarantees — is essential to make renewable energy projects financially viable, especially for underserved communities.
The ETIP support is being coordinated through the office of the UN Resident Coordinator, Mohamed Yahya, working with relevant ministries, development partners and the wider UN country team. Under the arrangement, SEforALL will support the ETIP’s development and planning work, while UN-ESCAP will focus on the financing architecture, including instruments and pathways to mobilise concessional and private capital.
Existing work on Green Euro­bonds, Panda Bonds, and Green Sukuk, alongside pay-as-you-go models should be bolstered to attract investment. There is also a need to investigate how funds support grid modernisation efforts, which are critical to answering Pakis­tan’s circular debt and integrating distributed solar and battery systems into the national energy infrastructure, ESCAP suggests.

 

UN-ESCAP through its Finan­­cing Energy Transition (FET) work which provided targeted technical assistance to Indone­sia, the Philippines and Viet­nam, has expressed its readiness to support Pakistan government with its expertise on the issue in conjunction with ESCAP’s existing work with Pakistan.
ESCAP’s FET work stream has already produced three analytical reports identifying critical gaps in energy transition finance, complemented by country-level capacity-building sessions and sub-regional policy dialogues in Southeast Asia. ESCAP through its expertise on integrated energy transition planning, capacity building, and scenario analysis may help contribute to Pakistan’s ETIP and its efforts on the national energy mix, industrial competitiveness, and progress towards Net-Zero emissions, while leveraging financial instruments such as green bonds and carbon markets, ESCAP says.
Pakistan’s energy mix remains heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, with imported oil, LNG, and coal dominating the power generation landscape – posing persistent challenges to fiscal sustainability and energy security.

In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event “political colour” as the song mentioned “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist today, who appeared before the court.
Amjad’s counsel submitted that the petitioner has no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants at the cultural programme.
He further requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail and sought the case record from the police.

 

The Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on January 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051349218fbd379.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965255/university-of-lahore-student-injured-after-jumping-from-varsitys-second-floor-police' target='_blank'><strong>University of Lahore student injured after jumping from varsity’s second floor: police</strong></a><br><p>A first-semester pharmacy student sustained injuries after she jumped from the second floor at the University of Lahore on Monday, police said.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran told Dawn that the student was originally from Narowal, adding that her parents had been asked to come to Lahore.
“She jumped from the second floor of the pharmacy department,” the DIG said, adding that for now, the incident appeared to be “a suicide attempt”.
However, he continued, police had yet to ascertain the reason behind the incident.
The official further stated that the student’s legs had been fractured, and she had been hospitalised. “Her condition is serious, but there is no severe head injury,” DIG Kamran added.
The director of emergency at Lahore General Hospital, Dr Yahya Sultan, also told Dawn that the girl was brought to the facility in a “serious condition” and she had sustained a minor head injury.
“There are profound chest injuries on the right side,” he said.
DIG Kamran said that according to the initial information collected thus far, it was discovered that the student was talking to someone on the phone around half an hour before the incident, but no further details were available yet.
“She jumped during the call,” he said.
The DIG said police had taken the girl’s mobile phone into custody, which was locked. “We are waiting for her medical treatment to end, following which we will ask her for her password so that the phone can be checked. Otherwise, we will get an analysis conducted,” he added.
The official said an investigation of the incident was under way and nothing could be said for certain at this point.
A first information report of the incident has not been filed so far.
DIG Kamran said it was up to the girl’s parents whether they wanted to file a complaint.
Meanwhile, the University of Lahore decided to suspend its on-campus classes.
A notice issued by the office of the varsity’s registrar on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “It is hereby notified for the information of all concerned that, in order to secure the campus buildings and ensure the safety and well-being of students, all on-campus teaching activities of the University of Lahore shall remain suspended.
“Accordingly, all classes scheduled today are called off and all academic activities will be shifted to online mode from Tuesday, January 6, 2025 until further orders,“ it added.
DIG Kamran told Dawn that police had spoken with the university’s administration, which had decided to suspend on-campus classes.
He said the administration had conveyed to the police that they were also considering installing fences on every floor or deploying staff to ensure safety and prevent the occurrence of such incidents.
Today’s incident comes less than three weeks after a 22-year-old Pharm-D student died after jumping from the fourth floor of the University of Lahore’s building on December 19 last year.
Family and classmates claimed that the student faced humiliation after low attendance in one subject. They said his entire semester could have been wasted despite the payment of his fee.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05090626fa59c7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965237/1-killed-8-injured-in-ied-attack-on-vehicle-carrying-cement-workers-in-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 8 injured in IED attack on vehicle carrying cement workers in Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: One person was killed while eight others were injured when a vehicle carrying cement workers was targeted by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
The district police spokesperson, Qudratullah, said that the vehicle, which was carrying cement factory workers, was targeted by Fitna al Khwarij terrorists near Nawar Khel area on Begokhel road.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He said the injured had been taken to the City Hospital. He identified the deceased as Faridullah.
The hospital’s spokesperson, Dr Kifayat Bettani, said that two of the injured were in critical condition. He added that the injured also included two women.
A separate police statement said that soon after the incident was reported, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan arrived at the scene along with a large police contingent. The statement said a large-scale search operation had been launched and the scene cordoned off.
One terrorist was killed while “several ” were injured during the operation, which was jointly conducted by the Lakki Marwat police, the Bannu Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and the local peace committee, a later statement said.

The operation was carried out in the Wanda Sheikh Allah and Zarif Wal areas. A police constable was also injured during the action and was immediately taken to a hospital.
“During the operation, the terrorists had taken positions in the mountains, as a result of which an intense fire exchange took place between the police and the terrorists,” the statement read.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan and Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir led the operation at the site, it added.
‘Police on high alert’
An earlier police statement quoted the Lakki Marwat DPO as saying that the “cowardly act“ was aimed at “disrupting the peace of the area”.
“The injured have been immediately shifted to the hospital, and the elements involved in the explosion will be arrested soon,” he said.
He added that the police were on high alert to maintain peace in the area and “all possible steps” were being taken to protect the lives and property of the people.
DIG Sajjad and DPO Nazir also visited the injured at the hospital, according to two separate statements issued by the police. The statements said they enquired about the well-being of the injured and reviewed the medical assistance being provided to the injured.
The officials instructed the medical staff to provide the best possible treatment to the injured, saying that negligence of any kind would not be tolerated.
They said the injured were their own people and that the police stood with affected citizens in all difficult times, according to the statements.
The officials also extended condolences to the family of the citizen killed in the incident, assuring that those involved in the attack would be brought to justice soon.
They further assured that all resources were being utilised to ensure the protection of the public and that operations against terrorists would be intensified.
The statement issued by the RPO’s office also said that “terrorists were now targeting the public, considering them easy targets after their attacks on police and security forces had failed”.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
On Sunday, four police personnel, including three traffic cops, were martyred in firing by unknown armed men in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
Police said the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when unidentified gunmen, riding on a motorcycle, opened fire on them. Meanwhile, a cop in Bannu was martyred in firing by unidentified attac­kers in the district’s Kashfi Khel area.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0516552338009d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965268/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland says ‘no more fantasies about annexation’ after Trump remarks</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s leader declared “enough is enough”, and Denmark’s allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island’s future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by US President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.
Trump spoke a day after the US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The US operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.”
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.
“Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends,” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday.
“Enough is enough. […] No more fantasies about annexation.”



On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the US.
Greenland’s strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the US ballistic missile defence system. The island’s significant mineral resources also align with Washington’s ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.
Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump’s latest remarks.
President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: “No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and Statsministeriet (Prime Minister’s Office) have our full support.”







France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by “predatory ambition”.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that US comments about needing to take over Greenland made “absolutely no sense”.
Protection of Greenland will be discussed within Nato if needed: Germany
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the Nato alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.
Wadephul was speaking after US President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland.
Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro’s removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country’s future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the US would run the country.
On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.
“And since Denmark is a member of Nato, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.
“And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.”
He did not elaborate on the nature of those discussions.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05180634d2e97e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965265/commonwealth-asian-games-and-t20-world-cup-to-shape-pakistans-2026-sports-calendar' target='_blank'><strong>Commonwealth, Asian Games and T20 World Cup to shape Pakistan’s 2026 sports calendar</strong></a><br><p>Sports fans and athletes alike can expect an action-packed 2026 calendar featuring major quadrennial sports events, routine international seasons, as well as plenty of domestic action.

Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city.
Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans.
He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region.
Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material.
He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid.
“We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture.
“The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material.
He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested.
Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.

The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified.
“All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest.

He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.
He said that the explosive material seized was “a mix”, saying that some of it was an amalgam of commercial explosives and other items, while some of it was smuggled through Balochistan’s mountainous regions.
The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05100722be6329f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965240/pakistan-china-call-for-more-visible-verifiable-actions-to-eliminate-terrorist-groups-based-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China call for more ‘visible, verifiable’ actions to eliminate terrorist groups based in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China issued a joint communique on Monday calling for more “visible and verifiable” actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, and prevent them from using Kabul’s territory for militancy against any other country.
The joint statement came after the conclusion of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.







“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.
“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.
The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.
“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.
“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.
“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.
Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.
Pak-China agree to enhance communication
According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.
Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.
They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.
Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.
It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.
Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.
China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.
Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment” to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.
“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.
It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.
The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.
China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.
The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.
‘Upgraded version of CPEC’
The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities”, the statement said.
According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.
They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.
The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.
During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.
They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan”, the statement said.
The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.
“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.
On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.
“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.
In October, China announced it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.
Agree to uphold UN Charter, oppose unilateral actions
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.
They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.
They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.
Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.
During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.
According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.
They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.
The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.

The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.
“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.
“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.
On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice”.
Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.
The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.
It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027”, the statement said.
Reiterate support for Palestinian state

Panjgur Assistant Commissioner Amir Jan said the IED was planted in a motorbike and added that three of the injured are in serious condition. “Two children are also among the injured.“
According to local police officials, a Frontier Corps vehicle, which was the probable target, escaped the attack and all personnel were safe.
A senior official of the local administration, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the motorbike laden with the IED was parked near a pushcart in the main bazaar.
Another police official elaborated that the blast appeared to have been carried out through remote control.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-05 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0517493562aab87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964912/martial-rule-agrarian-militarisation-and-political-centrality-of-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Martial rule, agrarian militarisation and political centrality of Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The concept of “martial rule” and the associated ideology of the “martial races” occupy a central place in the colonial and post-colonial history of Punjab.
Far from being a mere military recruitment strategy, this theory evolved into a durable socio-political framework that reshaped agrarian relations, state power, and political authority in the region.
Drawing upon the works of scholars such as Mustafa Kamal Pasha, Clive Dewey, Tan Tai Yong, and Rajit Mazumdar, one can trace how martial rule developed as an intellectual and administrative project, how it became deeply embedded in the agrarian economy of Punjab, and how its long-term ramifications elevated the military to a decisive force in contemporary politics.
The theory of martial rule emerged from the broader colonial construct of the “martial races,” formulated by British administrators in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. As Tan Tai Yong demonstrates, the rebellion marked a decisive rupture in British perceptions of loyalty and governance in India.
Communities that had resisted colonial authority, particularly in Bengal and Awadh, were increasingly viewed as politically unreliable, while populations from the north-western frontier, most notably the Punjab, were re-imagined as inherently loyal, hardy, and martial. This reclassification was not merely descriptive but prescriptive, guiding recruitment policies and administrative priorities in the decades that followed.
Clive Dewey locates the intellectual foundations of this theory in Victorian ethnographic and racial assumptions. Punjabi peasants, especially Jats, Sikhs, and Muslim Rajputs, were portrayed as physically robust, morally disciplined, and socially cohesive, qualities believed to arise from their rural environment and agrarian way of life.
These characteristics were contrasted with what colonial discourse described as the effeminacy and political volatility of urban and eastern Indian populations. Although no single individual can be identified as the sole originator of the martial races theory, British military and administrative figures such as Sir Frederick Roberts (1832-1914) and Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener (1850-1916) played a crucial role in institutionalising it within the recruitment and organisation of the colonial army by the late 19th century.
Mustafa Kamal Pasha advances this argument further by emphasising that martial rule was not simply an ideology of recruitment but a broader mode of governance.
In this framework, military loyalty came to substitute for political participation as the primary basis of state legitimacy. Particularly in strategically sensitive regions like Punjab, the colonial state privileged military-administrative control over representative institutions, thereby embedding coercive authority within everyday governance.
Martial rule thus functioned as a political logic that disciplined society while simultaneously rewarding loyalty through material and symbolic incentives.
The centrality of the Punjab to the colonial military project cannot be understood without reference to its agrarian restructuring. As Rajit Mazumdar argues, British rule deliberately fused landownership, military service, and political authority into a single, mutually reinforcing system.
Through canal colonisation schemes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, vast areas of irrigated land were allocated preferentially to serving soldiers and military pensioners. Access to land became both a reward for service and a mechanism for securing long-term loyalty to the colonial state.
Clive Dewey’s analysis of Punjab land policy reveals how this arrangement produced a military–agrarian complex in which economic stability and political conservatism were closely aligned.
Military service offered regular wages, pensions, and social prestige, while landownership anchored soldiers and veterans within the rural order. The figure of the soldier-peasant emerged as the ideal colonial subject productive in peace, dependable in war, and resistant to political mobilisation. This system also reshaped village hierarchies, privileging military families and reinforcing patriarchal and martial values within rural society.
Tan Tai Yong further observes that this fusion of military recruitment and agrarian economy insulated large parts of rural Punjab from the nationalist movements that gained traction elsewhere in India. The army acted as a social safety valve by absorbing surplus male labour and reducing pressures that might otherwise have produced agrarian unrest. As a result, the military became deeply embedded in everyday village life, influencing patterns of authority, masculinity, and social status in ways that endured beyond the colonial period.
The long-term consequences of this militarised agrarian order were profound and far-reaching. Mustafa Kamal Pasha argues that colonial martial rule laid the structural foundations for post-colonial military dominance, particularly in Pakistan.
At the moment of independence in 1947, Punjab especially West Punjab supplied a disproportionately large share of soldiers, officers, and bureaucratic elites to the new state. This imbalance translated into enduring institutional advantages for the military within the post-colonial political order.
The inherited nexus between land, arms, and authority facilitated the political ascendancy of large landowning families with military backgrounds, who came to dominate provincial and national politics. As Mazumdar notes, the military’s claim to political legitimacy rested not only on its coercive power but also on its deep social roots in rural Punjab, where military service was normalised and valourised across generations. This social embeddedness distinguished the military from other state institutions and enhanced its capacity to intervene in political life.
In contemporary times, this historical legacy has made the military a decisive political actor. The Punjab’s continued over-representation within the armed forces has reinforced the army’s self-image as the guardian of national unity and stability. Civilian political institutions, by contrast, have remained comparatively weak, fragmented, and often reliant on military mediation to resolve crises. The imbalance between civil and military authority cannot be adequately explained without reference to the colonial construction of martial rule and its agrarian foundations.
The theory of martial rule, originating in colonial anxieties after 1857, thus evolved into a durable system that intertwined military service with agrarian economy and political authority in Punjab.
As demonstrated by Pasha, Dewey, Tan Tai Yong, and Mazumdar, this outcome was neither accidental nor incidental but the result of a carefully engineered colonial strategy. Its ramifications extend well beyond the colonial period, continuing to shape patterns of governance, civil–military relations, and political power in contemporary South Asia. The enhanced role of the military in Punjab politics is therefore not merely a response to modern security challenges, but the culmination of a historical process in which land, loyalty, and arms were fused into a single structure of rule whose influence remains deeply embedded in the region’s political landscape.

The demonstrations began last Sunday in Tehran when shopkeepers staged a strike over high prices and economic stagnation, but they have since spread to other regions and expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Protests have taken place in 25 out of Iran’s 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 45 different cities, most of them small or medium-sized and concentrated in the west, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people have been killed since December 30 in localised clashes, including members of the security forces, according to a tally based on official announcements, and there have been media reports of episodes of property damage in the west.

 

The Fars news agency said on Monday that “the trend observed on Sunday night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geographic reach compared to previous nights”.
Local media’s accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, while double-digit inflation has been undermining Iranians’ purchasing power for years.
The rial was depreciating again on Monday against the greenback after strengthening in recent days, according to the informal black-market rate, which stands at around 1.4 million rials, compared with about 770,000 a year earlier.

 

Publicly, officials have struck a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while vowing to take a hard line against any chaos and destabilisation.</p><small>2026-01-05 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05162241750d61d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965262/mustafa-amir-murder-case-main-suspect-gets-bail-in-illegal-call-centre-case' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Amir murder case: Main suspect gets bail in illegal call centre case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate in Karachi on Monday granted post-arrest bail to Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the Mustafa Amir murder case, in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August. Besides multiple other cases, Armaghan had also been implicated in the data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.
Judicial magistrate (South) took up Armaghan’s bail plea today. Advocate Khurram Abbas appeared as his defence counsel and informed the court that the investigation against the suspect had been completed in 2025.
“Not a single shred of evidence was presented against the suspect. Neither is there any complaint nor any private witness against the suspect,” the lawyer argued.
Subsequently, the magistrate approved Armaghan’s bail plea against surety bonds worth Rs100,000.

 

However, Armaghan will remain in jail as multiple cases against him are still pending in court. Besides the murder case, FIRs against Armaghan had also been filed over injuring policemen during a February shoot-out that resulted in his arrest, recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.
In its FIR, the FIA had claimed that Armaghan was allegedly operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA. The FIA further alleged that the call centre was used for harassing people, engaging in fraudulent practices, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
It added that the employees of the said call centre were trained to impersonate officials from international agencies to extract sensitive information such as names, debit or credit details and social security numbers.
The FIA claimed that illegal transactions were carried out on the instructions of Armaghan alias Alex Boss.
Regarding the modus operandi, the agency stated that the suspect obtained financial information and processed it through the website www.oet.com to verify its authenticity. The credit cards were typically charged without any service being rendered, the FIA added.
In July 2025, the investigating officer (IO) of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05165149e2f2159.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/opposition-leaders-appointment-pti-chief-whip-submits-documents-pertaining-to-omar-ayubs-cases-to-na-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leader’s appointment: PTI chief whip submits documents pertaining to Omar Ayub’s cases to NA speaker</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, shared with National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday documents pertaining to the withdrawal of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub and again demanded Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairperson Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s appointment as the opposition leader.
The development comes around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.







According to a post on the NA’s X account, Dogar presented the documents to Sadiq today, and the two also exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader.
Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai be appointed as the opposition leader, the post said, adding that Ayaz gave the assurance that “everything will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”.
The statement further quoted Ayaz as saying that he would share information with the house on the matter at the next NA session.
“The process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated afresh,” he said, adding that the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader were clear.
The post of the opposition leader in the NA has been vacant since the disqualification in August last year by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his conviction in the May 9 cases.
The same month, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had nominated Achakzai for the post of opposition leader and despite the PTI‘s insistence for his appointment, his notification remains pending.
Meanwhile, Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC). But, he withdrew his plea in October last year.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
‘No formal contact for talks’
Earlier today, NA Speaker Sadiq said that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.
He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.
“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.
Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.
On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.







“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.
He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.

 

However, the PTI later said that it would not engage in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had stated that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
Bangladesh visit
The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the funeral of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had shaken hands during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.
“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.
He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.
Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.
He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.
He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05165036a578729.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965266/indias-top-court-denies-bail-to-muslim-student-leader-umar-khalid' target='_blank'><strong>India’s top court denies bail to Muslim student leader Umar Khalid</strong></a><br><p>India’s Supreme Court denied bail on Monday for former student leader Umar Khalid, who has been detained for more than five years on charges of conspiracy to trigger deadly riots.
Khalid, 38, was arrested in September 2020 under a sweeping anti-terrorism law and has remained in custody since, aside from brief releases to attend family weddings.
His case has become a touchstone for critics who say India’s more than 200 million Muslims face discriminatory treatment in the Hindu-majority nation.
Khalid was detained after the February 2020 sectarian riots in Delhi when 53 people were killed — mostly Muslims, but also several Hindus.
The Supreme Court in New Delhi dismissed his appeal for bail, saying that “prolonged incarceration” was not grounds to grant him release.

 

It also denied bail on the same grounds to another student activist, Sharjeel Imam.
But it approved bail for five others in the same case.
Khalid, a former student at Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, was charged with rioting with a deadly weapon, as well as attempted murder, sedition and causing enmity between different groups.
He denies all charges.
Police also accused Khalid of delivering “provocative speeches” ahead of the riots.
In 2022, he published an open letter saying that “we can be kept in jail for years, without those framing us needing to prove anything”.
His partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, has said that Khalid “became the victim of the injustice that he always fought against”.
Amnesty International and six other rights groups issued a statement in September calling for the release of Khalid.
“Khalid’s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India, as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,” Amnesty said in a statement to mark Khalid’s fifth year in prison.

 

Khalid’s arrest came months after protests against India’s contentious Citizen Amendment Act (CAA).
The 2019 law makes it easier for persecuted religious minorities from three neighbouring countries to obtain citizenship, but not if they are Muslim.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051437581930b45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259/bangladesh-orders-indefinite-ban-on-ipl-telecast-after-mustafizur-rahman-row' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh orders indefinite ban on IPL telecast after Mustafizur Rahman row</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh government on Monday ordered an indefinite ban on the telecast and promotion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) following the controversy surrounding the removal of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad, The Daily Star reported.
The development comes after KKR said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said after an emergency meeting that it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.
A statement from the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it had “noted that no reason was communicated for the decision behind Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion [from the IPL]” and that the development had “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”, Daily Star reported.
“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the statement said, adding that the decision had been taken “in public interest”.
It was signed by the ministry’s assistant secretary Firoz Khan.
“There is no logical reason for this decision of the Indian Cricket Board and such a decision has distressed, shocked and angered the people of Bangladesh,” the government statement further said, according to India Today.
“A request has been made to stop the promotion/broadcast of all games and events of the Indian Premier League (IPL) until further orders,” the statement added. TV channels and streaming platforms have broadcast the IPL in Bangladesh since its inception in 2008, according to ESPN Cricinfo.
This is also the first time that the Bangladesh government has banned the telecast of an international cricket tournament, anywhere in the world.
BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“
Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.
Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh
The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.
Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.
On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.

“If you do not stand up for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law and for an independent judiciary, then future generations will spit on us and you as well,” Afridi said.
He urged them to announce a lawyers’ movement, adding that the youth will support them. “Long live resistance,” the chief minister said.



“You must support the PTI founder [Imran Khan] against oppression and barbarity. Whose conscience is even one per cent alive will stand against the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, as well as unfair trials — whether of journalists or politicians — and will demand the release of all political workers who are wrongfully in jail,” Afridi said.
CM Afridi also stressed that Imran did not seek his release, but rather a fair trial. “A convicted person was received at the airport,” the PTI leader said, apparently referring to ex-premier Nawaz Sharif landing in Islamabad after he returned to Pakistan in October 2023.
During his address, Afridi also praised Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who was among the audience.
“Imaan Mazari has created a new history of resistance. The youth receive encouragement from her,“ Afridi said. He also mentioned that some journalists were recently sentenced after their “trials in absentia”.
“Arshad Sharif had to leave his country to save his life because he was not getting justice and security here, but he was not spared even abroad,” the KP CM said, referring to the journalist being shot dead in Kenya on Oct 23, 2022.
Afridi cautioned the lawyers that while the PTI was facing “oppression and fascism today”, it could be their turn tomorrow. “You will not be able to tolerate what the PTI has,“ he said.
Afridi once again lamented that he was repeatedly being denied a meeting with Imran, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“Three judges [of the IHC] issued orders for [my] meeting with the PTI founder, but the Adiala jail’s superintendent threw that directive in the trash,” the KP CM said.
He said that Imran was “fighting our war in jail”, adding that “those who took cars from the Toshakhana were the rulers and the person who took items legally was in prison“.
“They have incapacitated you all,” the chief minister said.
CM Afridi further said that “people from all schools of thought” in KP believed that a military operation was not the solution to rising militancy in the province.
“But there are still preparations for an operation. This is not a functioning system but hooliganism,” the chief minister said.</p><small>2026-01-05 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05000641ae0deb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965077/we-did-this-incredible-thing-trumps-capture-of-maduro-and-the-complexities-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>’We did this incredible thing’: Trump’s capture of Maduro and the ‘complexities’ of international law</strong></a><br><p>It shouldn’t be shocking and yet it still is. Images of the leader of a sovereign, oil-rich nation humiliated and handcuffed by the world’s superpower using tactics as crude as the resource it seeks to control. We have seen this before, after all.
Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, Congo’s Patrick Lumumba, Iran’s Mohammad Mosaddegh, Chile’s Salvador Allende and Panama’s Manuel Noriega all met the same fate (a full list would take up the entire article). Regime change, rinse, repeat.
‘He effed around and he found out’
By most accounts, Maduro seems to have gotten off lightly. In 2019, US Senator Marco Rubio threatened that the Venezuelan leader would meet the same fate as Qaddafi, tweeting a photo of the bloodied Libyan general before he was reportedly sodomised and killed by US supported rebels. The CIA has long preferred assassination as the policy option for stubborn leaders using underhanded tactics like poisoned cigars, turning lovers into honeypots, planting a Brutus within a Caesar’s inner circle. That is until Trump decided the US no longer needed to operate from the shadows.
In 2017, Trump considered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reportedly saying “let’s f***ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f***ing lot of them.”  And it seems with Maduro, someone did try. A few months after Rubio’s threat, there was an attack against Maduro’s life, which was “the world’s first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone, purchased online and armed by hand with military grade explosives”.
After spending many years trying to illegitimise the Venezuelan leader in order to pave the way for the invasion, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who has the verbal range of a legacy-admitted frat bro at an American university, said that Maduro had his chance but had “effed around and he found out”. He also said, in an effort to appease the Republican MAGA base, that this regime change operation was “America First” and he was right in a way; the biggest winners of the night were Texan oil barons.
‘We’re going to take back the oil’
The plot to overthrow Venezuela started when Hugo Chávez was elected into power. “Washington has never forgiven Chávez for nationalising the oil”, says Paul Craig Roberts, economist and Assistant Treasury Secretary for President Ronald Reagan, “and using the revenues from the oil flows for Venezuela rather than for the profits of American firms”. Chávez, a savvy economist advancing his state’s interests, wanted oil prices as high as they could go and lobbied fellow members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil output to keep prices high. He was charging American corporations a premium for his oil, a super heavy and filthy oil which they covet.
Chavez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, wanted to continue his legacy when he was elected into power in 2013 but his woes began soon into his premiership.
In 2014, the US worked with other oil-producing countries to intentionally depress the price of oil to undermine the economies of oil-dependent Russia and Iran.The biggest casualty of this cabal though was Venezuela whose economy was ‘destroyed’ given oil accounted for 96 per cent of its exports.
Soon after, President Obama imposed sanctions on the country claiming perversely that it posed a national security threat to the US.
Trump levied an even worse financial embargo that cut Venezuela off from almost all borrowing, stole its assets (with the help of European allies) and plunged an already economically distressed country into ruin. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have been killed due to restrictions on food and life-saving medicines with reports from renowned economists indicating that sanctions “fuelled an economic collapse equivalent to three Great Depressions”. All the while, the West collaborated to starve Venezuela and then blamed the country for starving.
However, Maduro clung to power and refused to sell his country to the US. His opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, who the US had touted as his replacement until the invasion, has been very clear that he would sell the country in a handbasket, having declared in the past: “I will open up the Venezuela oil fields to American companies.”
Maduro’s intransigence left Texan energy executives with three options — either import that oil from Canada which would take too long (7-14 days), or the Middle East which would take even longer (43 days), or install a puppet government in Venezuela which would give them cheap oil quickly (4 days).
For the final option, the government would follow a tried and tested two prong approach; illegitimise the government to topple it, and if that doesn’t work, invade.
‘The legal classification … is complex’
The process of illegitimising a government is led by rhetoric paid to a sacred set of rules we call international law. These rules are then set aside immediately once the illegitimising has proved fruitless and invasion is deemed to be required.
Maduro, we heard almost daily from mouthpieces in the West, is in flagrant violation of international human rights standards in his oppressive tactics and corrupt practices. Yet when the US invaded the country and captured its leader to overthrow him, suddenly international law becomes a very complex byzantine system that nobody without a doctorate should attempt to understand.
The lily-livered German Chancellor has said ‘[t]he legal deployment of the US deployment is complex. We will take our time with that.’ The craven Greek prime minister, after deploring Maduro’s violations of international law, says “this is not the time to comment on the legality of recent actions”. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister has pretty much said that if the government is bad enough, a country can be invaded. Apparently non-ironically.
I can quote international law by the yard and it is as clear as it can be. America’s actions are a violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and a clear act of aggression. The US’ own legal actions reflect this.
In the operation to abduct Maduro, the Trump administration has relied on a highly controversial 1989 legal memorandum claiming the President does not need to abide by the UN Charter as a matter of domestic law. That is as clear an admission of a violation as we can get from the US, which often cloaks its actions in the framing of self-defence, as it did with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in 2020.
Moreover, while Maduro is a lawful military target during the conduct of hostilities as commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces; when captured, he becomes a Prisoner of War protected by the Third Geneva Convention.
He can only be tried for war crimes, and not the domestic charges laid against him by a jurisdiction to which he should not be subject. While it seems to be the case that Maduro negotiated this exit himself, unfortunately for the German Chancellor, the international law violated here would be obvious to any first year student at any law school.
‘We can take care of the country’
Since the US has said, as per President Trump, that it will ‘run the country’ for an indefinite period and has also accepted that American boots were on the ground in Venezuela, the US will be an occupying power. The occupation will be governed by international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits changing any laws in the occupied territories ‘unless absolutely prevented’ from doing so.
This provision was left to collect dust in Iraq when the US coalition went so far as to pretty much rewrite the Iraqi constitution.  Paul Bremer, the American leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority, said that “[m]ost Iraqis have no experience of free thought. They vaguely understand the concept of freedom, but still want us to tell them what to do.”
The Venezuelans, it seems, will be suffering the same fate. They will be told what to do while their natural resources are privatised by cowboy moguls, their land is exploited by property tycoons, and their foreign policy decided by pro-Zionist wonks in Washington.
China and Russia will look on with dismay but apathy; if the Americas belong to the US, then Europe can belong to Russia and Asia to China. The Global South will pound their fists but know that it can and will happen again. And Iran will wait with bated breath.

PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
A joint press release issued on Monday said that the agreement marked a major step toward enhancing Pakistan’s national cybersecurity posture through collaboration in threat detection, mitigation, and prevention.
“The partnership between PKCERT and Kaspersky focuses on strengthening the country’s cyber resilience through a series of coordinated efforts. These include extensive training and awareness programs designed to enhance operational readiness across all levels of government, industry, academia, and civil society,” the statement said.
It added that the collaboration also focused on capacity development to cultivate a skilled cybersecurity workforce aligned with both national and international standards.
“Additionally, the two organisations will ensure the timely dissemination of actionable cyber threat intelligence to relevant stakeholders across Pakistan,” it said.
Under the MoU, the statement added, the organisations will cooperate across a wide range of cybersecurity areas, “including legislative and regulatory issues, incident detection and response, prevention and mitigation strategies, cybersecurity education, research and development, and professional exchanges”.
“The two organisations will exchange relevant technical information, threat intelligence, and data feeds related to cyber threats and cyberattacks affecting citizens, businesses, and government institutions in Pakistan,” it said.
According to the press release, the MoU was signed by Dr Haider Abbas, the director general of PKCERT, and Rashed Al Momani, general manager for the Middle East and Pakistan at Kaspersky. It was signed in the presence of Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky and IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja.
“Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in socio-economic development of a country; however, they have also introduced new challenges such as cyber espionage, hacktivism, ransomware, data breaches, identity theft, attacks on critical infrastructure, financial and supply chain disruptions, and disinformation campaigns,“ the statement quoted Abbas as saying.
“Our collaboration with Kaspersky, a global leader with expertise in these domains, represents another important step toward strengthening national cybersecurity,” he added.
“Safeguarding digital development requires robust cybersecurity, founded on deep and continuous partnerships between public authorities and private companies. Kaspersky has a long and fruitful history of working with global and regional organisations such as Interpol and Afripol, as well as local computer emergency response teams around the world,” Al Momani said.
“We highly value this cooperation with PKCERT as an important step in consolidating Pakistan’s secure digital transformation for the entire nation,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-05 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0512352389623c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965241/head-hits-back-for-australia-after-roots-majestic-160-in-fifth-ashes-test' target='_blank'><strong>Head hits back for Australia after Root’s majestic 160 in fifth Ashes Test</strong></a><br><p>An imperious Joe Root hit a magnificent 160 to drive England to 384 in the fifth and final Ashes Test on Monday before Travis Head let rip to haul Australia back into the contest with a rapid-fire unbeaten 91.
Root’s superb innings, his 41st ton to match Ricky Ponting, was only ended courtesy of a brilliant caught-and-bowled by Michael Neser, who finished with 4-60.
Australia were left to negotiate the final session of day two at a sold-out Sydney Cricket Ground, which they did for the loss of Jake Weatherald (21) and Marnus Labuschagne (48).
By stumps, the hosts had raced to 166-2 with nightwatchman Neser on one alongside Head.







Weatherald, who needed a big score to stave off the critics, again failed to live up to expectations since making his debut at the first Test in Perth.
He was dropped twice in the space of three balls, by Root then Ben Duckett, before Ben Stokes trapped him lbw.
But Head, who like Root has slammed two centuries this series, was in the zone.
He clattered three boundaries off the second over from Matthew Potts, in the side for the injured Gus Atkinson, and there was no let-up, blitzing a quickfire 50 off 55 balls.
Labuschagne was also in good touch, stroking seven boundaries before thick-edging Stokes to Jacob Bethell at gully.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another win after victory at the previous Test in Melbourne.
Root joins Ponting
England resumed at 211-3 but lost Harry Brook (84), Stokes (0) and Jamie Smith (46) before lunch.
Will Jacks (27), Brydon Carse (1) and Josh Tongue (0), along with Root, departed in the second session.
The day belonged to Root, who started on 72 and reached an almost chanceless century off 146 balls to reaffirm his status as an all-time great.
The 35-year-old had begun the series under pressure after failing to make a hundred in Australia over three previous Ashes tours.
He snapped the drought with an unbeaten 138 in the day-night Test at Brisbane and his exploits in Sydney drew him level third with Australia’s Ponting on the all-time century-makers’ list, with 41.
Only India’s Sachin Tendulkar (51) and South Africa’s Jacques Kallis (45) have scored more Test centuries.







Root and Brook came together with England in trouble at 57-3 on Sunday, with both eyeing big centuries on an ideal batting deck.
But Brook only lasted five balls on Monday, adding six to his overnight 78 before dabbing at a Scott Boland delivery and edging into the safe hands of Steve Smith at slip.
It ended a 169-run partnership, not just England’s best of the series but the biggest by either team, surpassing Head and Alex Carey’s 162 in Adelaide.
Stokes only survived 11 balls before getting the faintest of edges off Mitchell Starc to Carey.
Jamie Smith lived dangerously and was fortunate to survive after chipping Cameron Green to Labuschagne at cover on 22. He began walking off but replays showed Green overstepped and it was a no-ball.
He added another 24 before medium-pacer Labuschagne bagged him in his first over.
The run rate slowed significantly after lunch when the new ball was taken, but Root persisted, passing 150 for a 17th time, just one behind the legendary Don Bradman and three short of Tendulkar.
He and Jacks put on 52 for the seventh wicket until Jacks sent a leading edge to Green in the gully off Neser. Root was ninth man out and Tongue followed without any addition to the score.</p><small>2026-01-05 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0512242832179ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965246/we-can-revise-tariffs-very-quickly-trump-warns-of-higher-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>‘We can revise tariffs very quickly’: Trump warns of higher tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>The United States could raise tariffs on India if New Delhi does not meet Washington’s demand to curb purchases of Russian oil, US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday.
“They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.







India’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The US doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent last year as punishment for its heavy buying of Russian oil. Despite the hefty tariffs, India’s exports to the US leapt in November.
Encouraged by the improved trade data, Indian officials have maintained a firm stance against US trade demands, signalling limited flexibility in areas such as agricultural imports, while data shows India’s oil purchases from Russia have declined.
India is asking refiners for weekly disclosures of Russian and US oil purchases, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week, adding that they expect Russian crude imports to dip below 1 million barrels per day as New Delhi seeks to clinch a trade deal with Washington.
Modi has spoken to Trump at least three times over the phone since he imposed tariffs, but the discussions remain inconclusive.

His comments to reporters aboard Air Force One raised the possibility of further US military interventions in Latin America, and suggested Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they do not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the United States.







“Operation Colombia sounds good to me,” Trump said. He also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, “looks like it’s ready to fall” on its own without US military action.







He also insisted the US was “in charge” of Venezuela after the seizure of Maduro, but was also dealing with the new leadership in Caracas.
Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said at the same time that she was ready to work together with the Trump administration, asking the US leader for a balanced, respectful relationship.

 

“We’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in. Don’t ask me who’s in charge because I’ll give you an answer and it’ll be very controversial,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he had spoken to Rodriguez.
Pressed on what he meant, Trump said: “It means we’re in charge”.
Asked whether the operation was about oil or regime change, Trump replied: “It’s about peace on earth.”
The US president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait.

 

“We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said.
As he struck his triumphant tone, Trump also had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long,” Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership will be “hit hard” if protesters are killed.
The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro’s government as long as Washington’s goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela’s enormous crude oil reserves, are met.
Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. His capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation.
Top officials in Maduro’s government are still in charge and have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping.
“Here, there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemys provocations,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party.
Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.
Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”.
Venezuela’s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said.
The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid.
Vice President Delcy Rodriguez who also serves as oil minister has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela’s top court and has said Maduro remains president.
Who will run Venezuela?
Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump’s Venezuela strategy.
Trump said on Saturday the United States will “run” the South American country of about 30 million people.
But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed on Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change or elections.
The US is fighting drug traffickers, “not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC‘s ‘Meet the Press’. However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for “tremendous leverage”.
With questions swirling on Capitol Hill, an administration official told AFP that Rubio will discuss Venezuela in meetings with lawmakers Monday.
Trump has made clear Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez.
As news of Maduro’s capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago.
About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland.
Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro’s inner circle. But she has publicly contradicted Trump’s claim she is willing to work with the US.
Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro “if she doesn’t do what’s right,” according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.
The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark.</p><small>2026-01-05 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/050843576dabe62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965201/3-new-firms-seek-to-sell-gas-as-existing-licensees-remain-idle' target='_blank'><strong>3 new firms seek to sell gas as existing licensees remain idle</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As around a dozen existing licensees mostly remain non-operational, three new companies have applied for licences to sell natural gas following policy changes that allow greater private participation in the gas network.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has formally admitted applications from Blue Gas (Pvt) Ltd, Essen Gas Marketing & Distribution Ltd and Master Marketing Inte­rnational for licences to undertake the regulated activity of natural gas sales.
In their applications, the companies said they would use the pipeline networks of the two public-sector utilities — Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) — to transport gas produced from local fields to consumers as permitted under the Third-Party Access Rules, the Pakistan Gas Network Code and virtual networks. Such arrangements are allowed under the 2012 petroleum policy, recently amended by the federal cabinet.

 

Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for Jan 16 and invited comments from stakeholders before deciding on the grant of licences.
The regulator has already issued about a dozen licences to private firms for the sale of natural gas, but only one company — Universal Gas Distribution Company (UGDC) — has been able to practically enter into gas sale and purchase agreements with producers, consumers and transporters like SNGPL and begin commercial operations.
SNGPL and SSGCL, which enjoyed a legal monopoly over gas sales and distribution for decades, formally lost exclusivity in 2010. However, the enabling legal and regulatory framework for third-party participation remained weak for much of the following decade, effectively preserving their dominance until last year.
In January 2025, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, approved the sale of 35 per cent of new gas finds to third-party private entities through a bidding process. The move was aimed at easing liquidity challenges on exploration and production (E&P) companies and attracting $4-5 billion in fresh investment in offshore exploration.
In January 2024, the Council of Common Interests (CCI) — comprising the chief ministers of all four provinces — allowed E&P companies to sell reserves to third parties and directed the petroleum division and gas utilities to develop a framework for the sale of 35pc of unallocated gas to third parties and get it approved by the Ecnec.
The two public-sector gas utilities had been delaying the implementation and lobbied to reverse the CCI decision for almost a year, but Mr Dar-led Ecnec finally concluded that neither the council’s decision could be reversed nor a prospective $4-5bn investment in offshore blocks could be postponed. The government has since awarded around two dozen exploration licences, both in offshore and onshore basins, to local and international firms.

The suspect, a Qawwal, has been accused of giving the event ‘political colour’ as the song was associated with the jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
In the FIR, the complainant, the Shalimar Gardens in charge, Mr Zameerul Hasan, alleged that the singer, Faraz Khan, deliberately tried to exploit the cultural event and instigate people, as the song was associated with a particular political party. He said a music and cultural night was organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority, which was a non-political event.
However, he alleged the singer and his companions sang the song, associated with the PTI leader, on the demand of some audience. He told the police that the suspect should have kept in his mind that the event was open to the public, and was attended by people having affiliations with different political parties.
The controversial song posed a potential risk of creating unrest or violence, the complainant said, adding that the suspect and his accomplices were liable to be booked under the law.

Asia
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Balochistan chief minister and the president and premier of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday renewed calls for the implementation of United Nations resolutions on the region, as the country observed Jan 5 as Right to Self-Determination Day.
In separate messages, they reiterated Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for Kashmiris, urged the international community to press India to reverse its Aug 5, 2019, actions and called for a UN-backed plebiscite to determine the region’s future.
In his message, President Zardari said Jan 5 was observed in solidarity with the people of Jammu and Kashmir to mark the adoption of a 1949 United Nations resolution recognising the disputed status of the territory and affirming the Kashmiri people’s right to determine their future through a free and impartial plebiscite.
He noted that more than seven decades later, the commitment made by the United Nations remained unfulfilled, adding that the passage of time had neither weakened the validity of UN resolutions nor diminished the legitimacy of the Kashmiri people’s demand for self-determination. The continued denial of this right, he said, was in clear contradiction to the UN Charter and international law.
‘Durable peace in S. Asia’
In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said that the world must recognise that a just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was the only way to achieve durable peace in South Asia.
“We urge the international community to urgently call upon India to halt its widespread human rights violations in IIOJK (Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir), reverse its unilateral and illegal actions of Aug 5, 2019, repeal the draconian laws and give the right to self-determination to the Kashmiri people, as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to extend its unwavering moral, political, and diplomatic support to your cause, and will continue to serve as your voice at every available platform,” he said.
‘Not a political slogan’
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that Right to Self-Determination Day serves as a reminder to the international community that the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination is not a political slogan but a legally recognised international commitment enshrined in United Nations Security Council resolutions, which remains unfulfilled to this day.

 

In his message, the chief minister recalled that on Jan 5, 1949, the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan adopted a resolution granting the people of Jammu and Kashmir the right to determine their future through a free, fair and impartial plebiscite.
He said India’s continued illegal occupation and intransigence have consistently violated this international pledge.
Meanwhile, Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called upon the international community, particularly the United Nations, to play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and relevant UN resolutions.
In his special message on the occasion, President Chaudhry said that the Kashmiri people have rendered unprecedented sacrifices to achieve their right to self-determination, which was guaranteed to them by none other than the United Nations.
He said that the Kashmiri people firmly believe in the territorial integrity of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and regard it as an indivisible entity. He said that despite using all means of oppression, India has failed to dampen the Kashmiris’ passion and spirit for freedom.
Separately, AJK Prime Minister Faisal Mumtaz Rathore urged the United Nations to discharge its legal and moral responsibilities to help resolve the long-standing Kashmir dispute in line with the Kashmiris’ wishes and aspirations.
In his special message, the prime minister expressed dismay over the UN’s lackadaisical approach towards the issue, saying it was unfortunate that the promise of the right to self-determination made by the UN to the Kashmiri people seven decades ago is yet to be fulfilled.
He said that holding a plebiscite in Kashmir, as per the UN-proposed roadmap, remains the primary responsibility of the international community.

ISLAMABAD: In what appeared to be a lost battle, the PIA Employees’ Combined Bargaining Agent (CBA), People’s Unity, has asked the government to put on hold the signing of the airline’s share purchase agreement (SPA) and the transfer of management control to the Arif Habib-led consortium until consideration of its reservations and a counter-offer.
In a letter to PIA’s board of directors, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Privatisation, the union alleged that the privatisation process culminating in the bidding was non-transparent, claiming that employees were not allowed to participate. It said the CBA had the expertise to turn around the loss-making national carrier through professional management and a competent board.

 

People’s Unity President Hidayatullah Khan said the government was repeating “the blunder” of selling the airliner to Arif Habib Group, whose earlier takeover attempt of Pakistan Steel Mills was declared illegal by the Supreme Court two decades ago and which had only recently penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan for cartelisation in steel sector.
The union said that, as the CBA, it represented employees and was a key stakeholder. “We applied to participate in the bidding process for healthy competition but were declined by the Privatisation Commission,” Mr Khan said.
He added that the union had “serious reservations” about the privatisation of Pakis­tan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) and the transfer of 75pc shares with management control, alleging the process lacked transparency and “valuation of assets”.
The union further alleged that the process — from expression of interest to bidding, approved by the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) and the cabinet — was conducted “without due diligence”, and claimed it bypassed the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
It also argued that the PIA Act, amended in 2016, authorised the conversion of PIA into a public limited company but did not permit “outright privatisation” through the transfer of majority control.
The union demanded an urgent meeting before the SPA is signed and management transferred “to avoid repetition of blunders” in earlier privatisation efforts.
Quoting the Supreme Court’s 2006 ruling in the PSM case, the union said the apex court had held that the privatisation process was vitiated by acts of omission and commission, including alleged violations of mandatory legal provisions and rules, which affected decisions on prequalification, valuation and the final terms offered and declared the process void and of no legal effect.
People’s Unity also alleged that Arif Habib Group and its facilitators (Public Office Holders) remained unaccountable despite Supreme Court observation and prequalified for PIACL privatisation prior to disposal of its review petition in the PSM case, which is still pending in the Supreme Court.
It alleged that Ayesha Steel Mills, owned by Arif Habib Group, and International Steels Ltd (ISL) were involved in cartelisation and penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan in October 2025 and were imposed a fine of Rs1.5 billion.
The union contended that blaming PIA and its employees for the carrier’s performance was unjustified, arguing that outcomes were shaped by the commercial policies and priorities of management and the board.
Threatening to challenge the case before the parliamentary committees and other appropriate courts of law, the People’s Unity pointed out that the PIA Act 1956 (as amended in 2016), the SOEs Act 2023 and the NAB Ordinance required management performance monitoring. “The PIA would have not been in this situation if any system of check and balance and performance monitoring exist,” it added.
It claimed that the PIA workforce had better knowledge and experienced to turn around the airline, if a knowledgeable board of directors and professional management played its role without privatisation.
The CBA offered to provide all technical and financial details with clarifications to the Ministry of Defence, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the Privatisation Commission and the parliamentary committees as to how to turn around the PIACL instead of “wasting time and money in unnecessary litigation”.

The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the formation of a special committee to probe the frequent offloading of travellers, which has triggered growing concern and criticism from affected passengers.
Taking to his X account, Naqvi wrote: “Pleased to share that the Federal Investigation Agency (@FIA Pakistan) has launched Pre-Departure Facilitation Desks across all zonal offices with immediate effect.”







According to the FIA, the initiative aims to provide guidance and assistance to international travellers on immigration procedures and clearances, ensuring a smoother and more hassle-free travel experience.
The desks have been established in eleven zones – including Islamabad’s G/6 zonal office — and will be accessible for intending international travellers, as well as through helplines and email services.
An FIA spokesman told Dawn the desks will be operational for international travellers on Saturday and Sunday, with experienced immigration staff deputed to facilitate citizens.
“The immigration staff, headed by the assistant director and assisted by an inspector and a sub-inspector, will be available for citizens to provide them with details of visa documents required to travel, which visa is needed, a return ticket and how much currency they can keep with them, among other details,” he said.
The spokesman said the facilitation desks have been set up at FIA zonal offices for international travellers — both locals and foreigners — seeking travel-related information, with immigration staff available from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Sunday.
“Main zonal offices are located across the country, including Islamabad serving the federal capital territory, Karachi covering Sindh, Lahore covering Punjab, Peshawar covering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Quetta covering Balochistan. Zonal offices are also located in Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Multan,” he added.
Last month, FIA authorities told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development that it offloaded 66,154 passengers from Pakistani Airports in 2025 compared to 2024’s figure of 35,000.
Initially, FIA authorities were reluctant to share details of the large-scale offloading of international travellers, despite repeated media queries and complaints from passengers who said they were stopped despite holding valid travel documents.</p><small>2026-01-05 02:25</small></div><hr>
