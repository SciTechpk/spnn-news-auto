• Tax approved on previously exempt luxury private clubs
• Proposed e-commerce tax rejected; tax on online academies approved
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee has recommended raising the threshold limit for purchases made by “eligible individuals” — a new term for people who file their tax returns — and approved a measure to tax luxury clubs nationwide.
The development came as the Senate and National Assembly Standing Com­mittees on Finance and Revenue held simultaneous sessions at Parliament House to conduct a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025-26.
Chaired by Senator Saleem Man­dviwalla and MNA Naveed Qamar respectively, both panels proposed several amendments and rejected some measures outright.
The Senate standing committee expressed concern over the newly inserted clause in the Finance Bill, which restricts the “eligible person” from making any purchase exceeding 130 per cent of the wealth reflected in their last year’s wealth statement.
 






Senator Mohsin Aziz argued for increasing this limit, suggesting that filers with Rs10 million should be able to purchase property worth Rs50m. After discussion, the committee recommended raising the li­­m­­it to 400pc of the previous year’s wealth declaration, significantly ex­­panding purchase capacity for filers.
The Senate committee also approved a proposal to impose taxes on major private clubs across the country. In the Finance Bill 2025-26, income tax has been introduced on recreational clubs, which were previously exempted from tax.
State Minister for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani stated that the recreational clubs are liable to pay tax, where their income exceeds the expenditure and such steps have been taken to broaden the tax net of the country.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that many elite clubs serve as luxury spaces for affluent individuals. He highlighted that these clubs have accumulated billions of rupees in their accounts while providing extravagant services.
“Some clubs hold land valued at millions of dollars, yet only a handful of individuals benefit from these lavish facilities,” he said.
The proposed taxation will target the profits generated by these high-end clubs, ensuring that they contribute to the national revenue system, he added.
 
 

The FBR chairman informed the committee that a monthly income of Rs100,000 would only incur a tax of Rs1,000, stressing that the burden was manageable.
Senator Mohsin Aziz, however, pressed for raising the exemption threshold to Rs1.2m per year, citing inflation, while Senator Shibli Faraz highlighted how currency depreciation has eroded the real value of money.
Discussing the proposed tax on e-commerce, the committee argued that any levy should apply to goods rather than services. Senator Anusha Rahman opposed the government’s move altogether, criticising her own party’s approach for targeting online businesses instead of traditional retailers. Consequen­tly, the committee rejected the tax on e-commerce.
However, the committee approved a tax on online educational institutions and academies, citing their substantial earnings. The FBR chairman said some academies generate up to Rs20m a month and stressed that teachers earning through online platforms must pay taxes.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb also highlighted the newly introduced mortgage facility, stating that mortgages will be available for houses up to 2,000 square feet, and the individuals will also be eligible for tax credit not exceeding 30pc of their total income.
 
 

Commenting on the FBR’s new condition of disallowing 10pc expen­diture for purchases from unregistered suppliers, the Senate committee warned that this could stifle competition, as the number of registered suppliers remains low across the country.
Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul briefed the National Assembly’s standing committee on the new Five-Year Tariff Policy (2025-30), which proposes reducing customs duties and additional duties over five years, with an estimated revenue impact of Rs500 billion.
Mr Aurangzeb noted that the government had previously increased duties to manage its balance of payments crisis and curb imports, which also boosted revenue collection. However, even after the crisis stabilised, duties were not reduced, prompting a need for structural reforms.

Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon followed by a visit to the Oval Office.
Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — accompanied the COAS.
“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” the ISPR said in a press release.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, the statement said.
It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.
 
 

“Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR stated.
“President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” it highlighted.
The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir’s “leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics”.
The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a “gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties”.
On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump’s “constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis”.
He “acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community”, the ISPR press release said.
“A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,” it added, referring to the ongoing missile exchange between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.
The military notes that the engagement “marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity”.
Trump ‘honoured’ to meet army chief
When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”
Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.
“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”

Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, “This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”
White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Reuters reported.
But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.
Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.
Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Former president Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p><small>2025-06-19 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/191120549d90396.jpg?r=112058' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918013/pia-resumes-lahore-paris-flight-after-five-years' target='_blank'><strong>PIA resumes Lahore-Paris flight after five years</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The PIA has resumed Lahore-Paris flight five years after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) lifted ban on its operations in Europe.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and UK authorities had suspended permission for PIA to operate in the region in June 2020 after Pakistan began investigating the validity of pilots’ licences following a deadly plane crash in Karachi that killed 97 people.
Following the ban lift on PIA by the EASA in November last year, the national flag carrier had resumed Islamabad-Paris flights early this year. “We can operate for any destination in Europe now (except the UK) after the lifting of ban by the EASA. However, it depends upon traffic on specific routes in Europe,” a senior official of PIA told Dawn on Wednesday.
He said the PIA was also hopeful that its operation for the UK would resume in a couple of months as well. “Talks with the UK authorities concerned are underway and hopefully the PIA will be operating flights there in a couple of months,” he said.

Airline hopeful of resumption of UK operation in a couple of months

On Wednesday, the first weekly flight PK-733 departed from Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport for Paris, France, with 276 passengers on board.
The PIA has been operating two weekly flights from Islamabad to Paris since January this year.
“A Boeing 777 aircraft was deployed for this route, featuring a newly refurbished cabin interior designed to enhance passenger comfort,” a PIA spokesperson said and added that to mark the occasion, a ceremony was held at Allama Iqbal International Airport.
Passengers were seen off by PIA’s Chief Executive Officer Air Vice Marshal Aamir Hayat, Chief Operating Officer Khurram Mushtaq, Head of Mission of the French Embassy Franck Aubry, and other senior officials of the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA).
“This flight will further boost aviation, tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,” he said.
Mr Aubry expressed hope for deeper ties between Pakistan and France through this new air link.
On resumption of the Islamabad-Paris flight in January last, the national flag carrier faced criticism for an advertisement featuring one of their planes flying towards the Eiffel Tower, with many finding the image “insensitive and reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks”.
The ad showing [posted on social media by PIA] a Boeing 777 flying towards the Eiffel Tower with the caption “Paris, we’re coming today” even drew ire of the government functionaries. It was deemed a “stupidity” by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. The PIA subsequently issued an apology, stating the intention was not to offend or cause alarm.

The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found, the IOM said in a statement on Tuesday.
Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea, according to the UN body.
 
 

“With dozens feared dead and entire families left in anguish, IOM is once again urging the international community to scale up search and rescue operations and guarantee safe, predictable disembarkation for survivors,” said Othman Belbeisi, the IOM’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.
According to the statement, at least 743 people have died so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The deadly route, it said, is  “marked by increasingly dangerous smuggling practices, limited rescue capacity and growing restrictions on humanitarian operations”.
As of June 15, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, migrant landings on the Italian coast were up 15 per cent year on year, with most originating in Libya.
Mediterranean rescue
Maritime rescue organisations said on Wednesday they had pulled more than 175,000  people from the Mediterranean over the past 10 years, as waves of  migrants sought to use the dangerous sea route to reach Europe. The group of 21 NGOS active in the region estimated that at least 28,932  people had died while trying to cross the sea since 2015.
The majority had died in the central Mediterranean — waters between Libya, Tunisia, Italy and Malta — Mirka Schaefer of German NGO SOS  Humanity told a Berlin press conference. In that area, the equivalent of five adults and one child lost their lives every day over the past decade, she said. The number of unrecorded cases was likely to be “significantly higher”, she added.
Of the 21 organisations currently engaged in maritime rescue in the region, 10 of them are based in Germany. Between them, the groups operate 15 boats, four sail ships and four planes. The organisations have frequently clashed with authorities over their rescue operations, which were launched as Europe’s migration crisis broke out in 2015, when hundreds of thousands headed to the continent, mostly from the Middle  East.
In Italy, the current government has vowed to end crossings and attacked NGOs for creating a  “pull factor” that encourages departures, something migration observers say is unproven. Giorgia  Meloni’s hard-right government has passed laws requiring rescue ships to return to a designated port, a measure NGOs say is contrary to maritime law.
“The pressure on us is growing,” Schaefer said, criticising a lack of support from the German government.

The CCP had imposed a penalty of Rs25 million for PSM’s anti-competitive and discriminatory conduct. While acknowledging the violation, the tribunal partially allowed PSM’s appeal and reduced the penalty to Rs5m, citing the limited duration of non-compliance.
The CCP took suo motu notice in 2009 following media reports and a complaint by Frontier Foundry (Pvt) Ltd, which alleged preferential treatment by PSM towards a particular buyer, Abbas Group, at the expense of other market participants.
CCP’s investigation revealed that PSM withheld the supply of key steel products between November 2008 and January 2009 without any objective justification, thereby violating Section 3 of the Competition Ordinance 2007. The tribunal observed that PSM failed to inform all buyers of product availability, enabling exclusive access for a single group and causing harm to other market players. Such conduct constituted abuse of dominance under Section 3(2)(g) and (h) of the ordinance, it declared.

• Cabinet okays plan to eliminate Rs1.275tr power sector debt over six years
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Wednesday that the income tax rate for salaried individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million annually had been reduced to 1 per cent from the previous 5pc.
There has been some confusion over the income tax rate for the first slab.
While the Finance Bill indicated that the rate was reduced from 5pc to 1pc, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced during his budget speech that the new rate would be 2.5pc.
It later emerged that the federal cabinet had approved an increase to 2.5pc before the budget presentation to offset the additional fiscal burden caused by the recent hike in government employees’ salaries.
This was backed up by the FBR chairman, who told a parliamentary committee that only Rs1,000 tax would be applicable on a monthly income of Rs100,000.
Addressing the federal cabinet in a meeting broadcast live on state-run and private TV channels, the prime minister also defended the government’s decision to raise the defence budget in the newly presented federal budget, citing the need for better equipment for the country’s armed forces amid escalating regional conflicts.
Calling the regional situation “very alarming” due to the intensified conflict between Iran and Israel, the prime minister warned that the crisis posed a threat to both regional and global peace.
He reiterated Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the brotherly country Iran and its people against Israeli aggression and called upon the international community to make efforts to ensure an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing armed conflict.
During the cabinet meeting, the premier also highlighted that the Public Sec­tor Development Programme had been expanded to Rs1 trillion in the new budget, pledging to meet development goals.
The government has recently announced the federal budget 2025-26 and now it is being reviewed at different committees of the Senate and the National Assembly before its passage by the two houses of the parliament.
The government has proposed a defence allocation of Rs1.29tr for the next fiscal year — an 11.8pc increase over the original allocation for the outgoing year.
“Considering the fight against terrorism, we have increased the fiscal space to meet the requirements of the armed forces with regard to necessary equipment,” PM Shehbaz said.
He stressed that the recent great victory against India in the armed conflict was possible due to the professionalism of the armed forces and the support of 240m people of the country.
The premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with Iran, condemning Israeli aggression and urging the international community to secure an immediate ceasefire. He revealed that he had spoken to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situation.
He described the scenes in Gaza as heartbreaking, noting that over 50,000 innocent Palestinians had been killed. “Brutality is being unleashed. When will the world’s conscience awaken?” he asked.
The prime minister informed the cabinet that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would attend the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting in Turkiye on June 21-22.
As for economic measures, the premier said the government had convinced the International Monetary Fund not to impose taxes on the agricultural sector, including fertiliser and pesticides, stressing that farmers were already under strain. He expressed gratitude to the IMF for agreeing to the request.
Without naming the PTI government, PM Shehbaz said the incumbent government did not act like those who had broken the promises (with the IMF) and took the country to the verge of default. He said his administration had averted a financial crisis and was steering Pakistan towards economic stability.
He also praised a delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for effectively representing Pakistan’s position on Indian unilateral actions during visits to the US and Europe.
Power sector debt plan
Meanwhile, in a key decision, the federal cabinet approved Pakistan’s largest financial scheme to stabilise the power sector by eliminating Rs1.275tr in circular debt over the next six years, without adding burden to the national budget.
Under the plan, Rs683 billion of Power Holding Company’s debt will be refinanced, and outstanding payments to independent power producers (IPPs) will be settled. The scheme aims to implement sustainable reforms, ease financial stress and restore investor confidence in the energy sector.
The prime minister commended Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his recent address to the Pakistani diaspora in the US, calling his commitment to safeguarding Pakistan’s interests a source of national pride.
The cabinet also expressed appreciation for Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his economic team for presenting a “people-friendly budget” for the upcoming fiscal year. Commendation was also extended to Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf for the arrangements made for Haj pilgrims this year.
The cabinet also approved the appointment of Kamaluddin Tipu as the chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Human Rights.
Additionally, the cabinet granted an exemption under Section 21 of the Pakistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 to the National Power Parks Management Company Limited for procurement services related to the acquisition of the Rousch Power Plant.
It also ratified the decisions made during the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases meeting held on May 21.

In modern geopolitics, the first is a sine qua non, the second a fickle firefly.
In its 250-year-old history, the US army has faced a range of foes. The list is long and open-ended — from Germany, the (former) USSR, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and now China. The US is addicted to war: it gets high on hostility.
Here, India and Pakistan are in the last quartile of their ‘Hundred Years War’. Had they been a married couple, in 2022 they would have celebrated their diamond anniversary. But theirs is not a union of choice. It has been a reluctant pairing, fomented by suspicion and sustained by state-sponsored hate.
There are still many Pakistanis and Indians who recall with genuine nostalgia a pre-Modi India, when borders were lines not barriers, when interest in each other was not simply security-related, and when hope sprang, if not eternal, at least periodical. They both wonder why the Indian media (normally balanced) has become irrationally bellicose, why it still advocates war-war to jaw-jaw, when peace is clearly a cheaper option.

The world is too dangerously close to World War III.

Or does India prefer to imitate its ally Israel and to periodically ‘mow the grass’, using covert terrorist attacks within Pakistan as a scythe?
Israel, like the US, has tested a number of foes. The latest is Iran. During the past week, they have been locked in open war. This is not accidental.
In 2023, Yonah J. Bob and Ilan Evyatar in their book Target Tehran predicted as much, with a specific date: “If the Israel-Iran chess game is played out further, things could become ominous. If Iran knows that Israel also knows that it might break out a nuclear weapon before October 2025 […] Israel might decide to strike before the Iranians have had more time to prepare — in other words, before 2025.”
 
 

The book was written while Joe Biden (a Democrat) was still president. Like his predecessor Barack Obama, Biden acted as a brake on Israel. Donald Trump, however, is unashamedly Israel’s engine.
Will the Israel-Iran war continue? The two authors think it likely. Their view is that “the conflict between Israel and Iran seems in its essence sadly unchanged, and perhaps unchangeable. Barring the collapse of the theocratic regime, Iran will continue to do two things: one, strive to become a nuclear weapon state, and two, for reasons of religious ideology and national grandeur, seek the destruction of Israel”.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons by smaller countries had been foreseen by Henry Kissinger 70 years ago. In 1957, he predicted in his book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy: “Within another 15 years the diffusion of nuclear technology will make inevitable the possession of nuclear weapons by many now secondary states.” Today, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel have also gone nuclear.
Israel has never disguised its policy to prevent any ‘radical’ Muslim country from going nuclear. It noshes from a ‘table d’hôte’ menu. The appetiser was Iraq. In 1981, Israel destroyed an unfinished nuclear reactor near Baghdad. The main course is Iran. Does Iran in fact have nuclear weapons? Or are they like Iraq’s unproven WMDs? And for dessert, Israel has selected Pakistan.
A distance of 3,300 kilometres separates Islamabad from Tel Aviv. Islamabad and Beijing are closer than the notional 3,800km. As the spat following Pahalgam has proved, China and Pakistan are more than distant iron brothers. They are adjacent allies, with umbilical interests.
Israel is trying to draw its sponsor the US into the war ag­­ainst Iran. Trump is tempted. He should heed Kissinger’s advice: “In the Nuc­l­ear Age, abandoning an ally risked eventual disaster, but resorting to nu­­clear war at the side of an ally guaranteed immediate catastrophe.”
For the first time since 1945, the world is too dangerously close to World War III.
 
 

To understand the present situation, one needs to go back a century, to the 1914-18 war. World War I resulted in an estimated 16 million deaths, including 9m military personnel and 7m civilians. The paucity of intelligent leadership elicited from the German Gen Erich Ludendorff the back-handed compliment that the British soldiers were “lions, led by donkeys”.
The French politician Clemenceau went further: “War is too serious a matter to be left to generals”. In a modern context, he would have added that nuclear warfare is too serious a matter to be left to democratic despots.
It is not insignificant that immediately prior to attacking Iran, on Friday the 13th, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Indian PM Modi. One wonders whether Netanyahu suggested that Modi should take to gardening again, and use his scythe to mow our grass.

While the Israelis struck with great ferocity initially, Iran has fought back, causing major damage to Israeli cities.
Yet despite the intense exchange of fire across hundreds of kilometres, neither side is ready to back down, and no off-ramps are visible for de-escalation. In fact, the threat of regional war has grown with signs that the US may get involved in attacking more Iranian nuclear facilities at Tel Aviv’s behest.
 
 

More American military hardware has been moved to the region while President Donald Trump has said he may or may not get involved militarily. He has demanded “unconditional surrender” from Iran, suggesting that the Iranian supreme leader could be targeted. In response, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran will reject “an imposed war” and “an imposed peace”, and that his nation “will not surrender”.
This crisis is entirely of Israel’s own making. Iran and the US were making satisfactory progress on the nuclear issue when Tel Aviv threw a spanner in the works. In fact, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other warmongers in Israel have dreamt of attacking Iran for decades; this was their golden opportunity. Israel’s recklessness has brought the world to the edge of a disaster that could ignite the entire Middle East, and send shockwaves across the global economy.
In a sanctimonious statement after the recent G7 summit in Canada, the grouping termed Iran as “the principal source of regional instability and terror”, while mouthing the tired shibboleth about Israel’s ‘self-defence’. This is doublespeak at its finest.
 
 

While Iran indeed has issues with many of its Arab neighbours, when it comes to state-backed terror, occupation of territory and the mass murder of civilians, Israel is in a class of its own. It is because of this mollycoddling by its Western patrons that Israel today feels it can violate the sovereignty of other states at will, while butchering the Palestinian people without remorse.
The only way to stop the march towards an expanded war is for Tel Aviv to be muzzled immediately. If Mr Trump makes the mistake of plunging into the fight on Israel’s behalf, the world will enter very dangerous territory. Iran may be no match for the US-Israel combine militarily, but it will defend itself vigorously in the face of an existential threat.
Instead of launching another imperial regime change/nation-building crusade, the US and its European allies must prevail on Israel to end the war now. Washington must not join Tel Aviv’s war party, while the global community must censure Israel for sowing chaos in the region, while unleashing genocidal violence in the occupied territories.

Nobody likes taxes, so any plan to raise taxes anywhere will raise objections. But some objections carry more merit than others. In this budget, the government is seeking to raise incremental tax revenues of Rs600 billion via new measures, and the finance minister has proudly told us that Rs400bn of that will come from “enforcement measures”. That’s two-thirds of the new revenue mobilisation that is going to be squeezed out of those who are already compliant and paying their taxes. That’s not a plan. That’s a hit job.
In response, the lawmakers have started questioning the powers the tax authorities are demanding. Chief among these are powers to arrest being given to the FBR. And herein lies an interesting story.
 
 

To be fair, these powers always existed and the new Finance Act is only seeking to modify them. The real question is the nature of the modifications being sought.
The earlier powers were contained in Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act. Back in 2013, the Lahore High Court (LHC), in a judgement authored by justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Mamoon Rashid Sheikh found that “Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, could be employed to select or pick a taxpayer out of the pool of self-assessed taxpayers to undergo criminal prosecution without first carrying out an objective selection process of audit followed by assessment of tax under S. 11 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990”.

The legislators are right to look at how regressive the new tax measures are.

That judgement was issued in a case in which 134 people had criminal prosecution opened against them on the charge of selling fake sales tax invoices against which people could claim input tax adjustment. The FBR claimed that these individuals ran a racket using 144 dummy suppliers that caused a loss of Rs7.5bn to the state. FIRs were cut, arrests were made.
The tax authority also argued that “civil proceedings leading to assessment of tax and penalties followed by the recovery procedure under section 48 has not proved successful over the years” according to the judgement, and using criminal prosecution to deter such practices and enable proper tax recovery was essential.
 
 

However, the court found a problem. If the purpose of the criminal proceedings is only to deter criminal behaviour, then the law is fine. But if the purpose includes recovery of dues, or imposition of a fine the amount of which is linked with the recovery of dues, then it is necessary to first determine the quantum of the tax due before criminal proceedings can be initiated. And that quantum must be determined in accordance with Section 11 of the Sales Tax Act which lays down the procedures through which assessment and recovery of tax evaded is to be computed.
In the words of the judgement, the “civil and criminal proceedings can run independently and simultaneously or otherwise. The purpose and objective of criminalising tax fraud and tax evasion is retribution and deterrence which is achieved through punishment or fine or both. If the law, however, goes further and criminalises recovery of tax in addition to retribution and deterrence, then tax assessment has to take place first under the provisions of the Act.”
The 2025 Finance Act brings in new language however: “The officer of Inland Revenue, during the investigation, having reason to believe on the basis of evidence that actions of any person may have caused or attempted to cause tax fraud or any other offence warranting prosecution under this Act, may cause arrest of such person with prior approval of the Commissioner”. The legislators should examine this language to see how it impacts the restraints the courts have demanded in the construct of these powers.
Over the years, a number of other such cases surfaced, and a large number of them were clumped under a single appeal filed in the Supreme Court by the FBR. That appeal was dismissed quickly last year, though the longer order with detailed reasoning is still awaited.
 
 

The courts had already interpreted the powers of arrest and overall criminalisation of tax recoveries after allegations of tax fraud. And they had circumscribed these powers. The tax authority had to first determine the quantum of tax allegedly defrauded, via the collection of material evidence in accordance with defined law. An individual thus arrested had to be produced within a day before a special judge, who could order release. But now these powers are being changed fundamentally, and the legislators should look to see how the restraints applied by the courts in the past will be maintained in the new wording, given that the LHC found that serious constitutional issues are at stake, including the right to a fair trial.
The legislators are right to look at how regressive the new tax measures are. A tax on solar panels, for example, aims to collect tax primarily from those who are off-users of electricity since they are the largest buyers of solar panels. If this tax falls on net-metering consumers, or industry, then it’s fine. But the poor, those underserved by the grid, should be protected. It is not clear how this will be possible since a full and final tax is usually collected at the import stage, irrespective of who the panels are sold on to.
The most grievous of the tax measures include the withdrawal of a rebate for school teachers and university professors. This is coming up for discussion in the committees soon, and committee members should stand firm that this cannot be withdrawn. A commitment had already been given by the government to the National Assembly’s finance committee in a hearing at the end of May that this rebate will not be withdrawn. That commitment must be upheld.

• Collection of tax on digital services handed over to provinces
• PIDCL to oversee federal projects in all provinces
• Funds for Sindh varsities to be maintained
ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the ruling PML-N has finally agreed to four major demands of its key ally PPP, thus paving the way for the federal budget’s smooth passage in the National Assembly.
Taking the floor during the budget debate in the lower house of parliament on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar revealed that after extensive consultations with PPP leaders, including Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the government had accepted the PPP’s key demands, including reduction in the proposed General Sales Tax (GST) on solar panels.
The assurance came in the wake of constant criticism from the members, mostly from the PPP, on a number of budgetary proposals during the ongoing budget debate.
Amid desk-thumping by the treasury members, Mr Dar announced that the digital sales tax on services would remain within the jurisdiction of the provinces, while the proposed 18pc GST on solar panels had been reviewed and revised down to 10pc.
Mr Dar stated that after detailed discussions with coalition partners and relevant stakeholders, including the people in the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), a consensus was reached on Tuesday night to resolve several contentious budgetary issues.
He termed the concerns raised by the PPP regarding digital taxation as “valid,” and said the issue would be clearly addressed by finance minister in his winding up speech in the assembly.
Mr Dar said despite the fact that 54pc of components used in solarisation were already taxed, there was a widespread concern among stakeholders over the government’s proposal to impose 18pc GST on remaining 46pc of the components.
“However, we have now proposed reducing the solar GST from 18pc to 10pc,” he declared.
Mr Dar said when a relief was announced in any sector, they had to look for other ways to generate the revenue to fill the gap. He said initially the government had decided to announce six per cent increase in the salaries of the government employees, but after a discussion in the federal cabinet, they finally announced 10pc raise. He said now they were under discussion with the IMF as to how to compensate this additional expenditure.
Referring to another PPP’s demand, the deputy PM said that it had been decided to maintain funding for Sindh universities in the PSDP through the HEC at Rs4.7bn. In the budget, the government had reduced the amount to Rs2.6bn.
He said the prime minister had also acknowledged valid concerns raised by the PPP regarding handing over of now-defunct PWD projects to three provinces and the projects in Sindh to the newly established Pakistan Infrastructure Develo­pment Company Limited (PIDCL). He said the prime minister had agreed that there must be a uniform policy for all the provinces. He said the PIDCL would now oversee federal development projects in all the provinces.
However, Mr Dar did not mention the issue of less allocation for the ongoing projects in Sindh, including the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway.
Many PPP members in their budget speeches had categorically announced that it would be challenging for them to vote for the budget in its present form.
Besides opposing imposition of 18pc GST on solar panels, the PPP members had been agitating over the “step-motherly treatment” with Sindh province by making meager allocations for the ongoing projects in the province. The PPP members had been mainly protesting over “failure” of the federal government in handing over the projects which were being carried out by now-defunct PWD to the Sindh government as well as the Centre’s decision to directly collect tax on digital services.
Taking the floor, PPP’s veteran parliamentarian Syed Naveed Qamar said the government had by and large addressed their issues.
“We are thankful to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister. Our issues have been mitigated to some extent,” said Mr Qamar.
He welcomed the reduction of GST on solar equipment from 18pc to 10pc, but said the party would like to see further reduction in it up to five per cent.
“Matters are settled now,” declared Mr Qamar.
Earlier, taking part in the budget debate, PPP’s Ijaz Jakhrani had already disclosed in the assembly that the issues between his party and the PML-N had been resolved and his party would now have no hesitation in supporting the budget.
“Why should we not vote when the government has listened to us,” he said.

The conflict has ravaged the Gaza Strip and resulted in severe shortages of food, fuel and clean water.
Civil defence spokesman Mah­mud Bassal told AFP that 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded “after the occupation forces opened fire and launched several shells… at thousands of citizens” who had gathered to queue for food in central Gaza.
The civil defence agency said an­­other 19 people were killed in three Israeli strikes, which it said targe­ted houses and a tent for displaced people. Three more people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a neighbourhood northeast of Gaza City on Wednesday, Bassal said.

Israel military raids refugee camps in occupied West Bank

In early March, Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza, amid a deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May. Since then, chaotic scenes and a string of deadly sho­otings have occurred near areas where Pales­tinians have gathered in hopes of receiving aid.
 


Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
The civil defence agency reported that at least 53 people were killed on Tuesday, as they gathered near an aid centre in the southern city of Khan Yunis hoping to receive flour.
After Israel eased its blockade, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid in late May, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and dozens of deaths.
‘Outrageous’
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
The head of a UN inquiry said on Wednesday that the use of GHF to distribute food in the Pal­estinian territory is “outrageous”.
“In every war, the siege and starvation surely leads to death,” said Navi Pillay, who chairs the UN’s Inde­pe­ndent Interna­tional Commis­sion of Inquiry on Israel and the Palestinian territories.
“But this initiative of what’s called a foundation, a private fou­ndation, to supply food, is what I see as outrageous, because it involves the US itself, the government, and it turns out, as we watch daily, that people who go to those centres are being killed as they seek food.”
 


Raid on refugee camps
Israeli troops raided two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank’s north overnight.
The military said that at  “around 4am Israeli forces entered Balata camp”, near the northern city of Nablus, for  “a routine counter-terrorism operation”.  It added that the troops had been deployed to the nearby Askar camp prior to the operation in Balata camp.
Imad Zaki, head of the popular services committee of Balata camp, also told AFP that the military began its raid at 0100 GMT on Wednesday.
“They closed all entrances to the camp, seized several homes after ev­­icting their residents, and orde­red the homeowners not to return for 72 hours. These homes were tur­ned into military outposts and int­er­ro­gation centres,” Zaki said.

The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, says the situation in Kashmir exemplifies the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscores the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.
The index, a snapshot of the global state of peace, ranked Pakistan at 144, showing ‘low state of peace’ while India ranked 115 position with ‘medium state of peace’.
Ukraine and Russia have been placed at the bottom of the rankings of 163 countries.

Global Peace Index ranks Pakistan at 144, India at 115; says South Asia tensions remain perilously high

About conflict history and escalation hotspots in India, the index report says the conflict is highly likely in the Kashmir region over the next year.  Applying the escalation-risk indicators to the Kashmir dispute finds it has the potential for rapid deterioration. A four-day conflict ensued from 7-10 May 2025 and was the deadliest escalation betwe­­en the countries in several years.
 
 

A renewed confrontation over Kashmir would involve the two nuclear-armed rivals. Although a deliberate nuclear strike remains highly unlikely, any conventional campaign confined to the disputed territory could still inflict heavy battlefield losses and easily spill beyond the Kashmir region.
The conflict over Kashmir has the potential to substantially escalate or even become a full-blown war. Past triggers like terror attacks and corresponding Indian strikes on Pakistan have been controlled and external actors have placed significant pressure to de-escalate.
There is also a substantial risk of conflicts or increased violence inside India and Pakistan, with the potential for anti-Muslim violence in India or rebel groups like Balochistan separatists or the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan taking advantage of any conflict between the countries.
The Global Peace Index 2025 has pinpointed a set of critical escalation hotspots and regions where conflict risks are accelerating and could evolve into major wars.
According to the index, South Asia, the second least peaceful region globally, experienced the largest regional decline in peacefulness. This deterioration was driven primarily by repressive measures in Bangladesh under the Hasina government, and the heightened civil unrest and escalating internal and cross-border tensions in Pakistan.
This year’s results found that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.36 per cent. This is the thirteenth deterioration in peacefulness in the last 17 years, with 74 countries improving and 87 deteriorating in peacefulness. Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008.

“In the last five years, increased living costs are the leading reason for borrowing in 2024, reported by 12pc of Pakistani adults”, said Karandaaz Pakistan — a government partner in digitisation and tax reforms — in its once-a-decade Financial Inclusion Survey (K-FIS).
Besides the living costs coming as financial shock and increasing borrowing needs, the survey completed with the financial support of the Gates Foundation and UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) noted that 7pc adult Pakistanis were found to have been forced to borrow due to healthcare expenses and 6pc others for the loss of employment.
Other notable reasons include marriage expenses 3pc, and climate change-related needs like crop failure or agricultural loss 3pc, and property damage 2pc, while education expenses 1.5pc and earthquake-related losses 0.1pc were the least common reasons for borrowing.
“The need for loans due to rising living costs is widespread, affecting 12pc of Pakistani adults overall. The highest demand is among self-employed individuals (15pc), followed by blue-collar workers (14pc), housewives (14pc), and individuals who are not working due to a disability (12pc), indicating financial strain across diverse groups”, the survey findings said adding the urban residents (8pc) and white-collar workers (7pc) reported lower demand, while students (2pc) had the least need.
The need for loans due to unexpected medical expenses is reported by 7pc of Pakistani adults, with the highest demand among the unemployed with disabilities (16pc), followed by blue-collar workers (10pc) and unemployed individuals (10pc), indicating financial vulnerability in these groups. Rural residents (8pc) report a higher need than urban residents (6pc), while white-collar workers (3pc) and students (1pc) have the lowest loan demand for medical expenses.
The overall need for loans due to loss of employment or income remains low at 6pc across most demographics. Blue-collar workers (10pc) report the highest need in this financial shock as well, followed by the self-employed (7pc), unemployed (6pc) and housewives (6pc), indicating higher financial vulnerability in these groups. White-collar workers (4pc), retired individuals (2pc), and students (1pc) have the lowest loan demand due to income loss. Rural and urban residents report equal needs (6pc).

• US president ‘dismisses’ Modi’s claim that Washington had no role in India-Pakistan
de-escalation
• Insiders say meeting secured via ‘unconventional means’, not diplomatic channels
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was “honoured” to meet Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for talks at the White House.
Field Marshal Munir has now become the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
The meeting, which began aro­und 1pm local time and lasted two hours, came hours after the US pre­sident shot back at Indian PM Narendra Modi’s claim that the United States had not pla­yed any role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in May of this year.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.
When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”
Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.
“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”
White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Reuters reported.
But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.
Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released President Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.
Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.
The working lunch saw senior aides from both sides in attendance. Insiders viewed the meeting as a milestone — perhaps a signal of a new phase in US-Pakistan relations.
South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, [and] CT,” he said. “Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all. Also, Kashmir.”
Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also hailed the meeting as a positive development for strengthening Pakistan-US relations.
The PPP leader, who recently led a high-powered delegation to Western capitals to convey Pakistan’s perspective on the military stand-off with India earlier this year, also pointed to the timing of the meeting as being quite significant.
Trump ‘snubs’ Modi on mediation
Tuesday’s phone call between Modi and Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, which the former attended as a guest, was the two leaders’ first direct exchange since the May 7-10 conflict.
Giving a readout of the call, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri claimed the Indian PM had told the US president the May ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two militaries, and not US mediation.
“Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.
Misri also said that Trump expressed his support for India’s fight against terrorism and that Modi told him ‘Operation Sindoor’, under which it launched the cross-border strikes, was still on.
A White House official said on Wednesday that Trump had spoken with Modi a day earlier, without providing details of the call.
But later in the day, while speaking to reporters on the White House lawns, Trump insisted that he was the one who stopped the war.
When asked about his meeting with Pakistan’s army chief, he said: “Well, I stopped a war … I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We’re going to make a trade deal with Modi of India. But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”
Referring to Field Marshal Munir, Trump continued: “This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it — and they’re both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”
Last month, Trump had said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
Reacting to Vikram Misri’s remarks, Mr Bhutto-Zardari tweeted: “Indians are just really very sore losers at this point”.

Earlier today, the budget session was delayed by over two hours after five opposition members — four from the PTI and one from the Jammu Kashmir People’s Party (JKPP) — staged a sit-in at the entrance of the assembly hall, protesting what they described as the government’s attempt to “bulldoze the budget”.
Four to five cabinet members approached the opposition to convince them to end their protest and voice their concerns inside the hall, but they were told that verbal assurances aside, the government’s “ill-will” was evident from the agenda of the budget session.
The agenda stated that after the presentation of the revised budget for 2024-25 and the estimated budget for 2025-26, the finance minister would move a motion for suspension of Rules 127, 128, 129, and 131 of the Rules of Procedure of Assembly — all pertaining to the budget process.
According to Rule 129, the speaker shall fix at least four days for open debate on the budget, provided there is a gap of two days between its presentation and the start of the debate. The coalition government has presented and passed its two previous budgets in a single day by suspending these rules.
After the ministers returned in disappointment, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar himself attempted to persuade the protesting legislators, but also failed to bring them around.
Later, treasury members made their way into the assembly hall by navigating the space on either side of the sofas occupied by opposition lawmakers, following which the Finance Minister Majid Khan was given the floor by the chair to present his budget speech.
But before the finance minister began his speech, he moved a resolution for suspension of rules, which was approved by the treasury benches with a majority vote.
“Budget is not just a statement of income and expenditures, but a summary of the just distribution of available resources, future planning and official priorities,” Majid Khan said.
“I am presenting a people-friendly as well as historic budget in terms of its volume, and I  am sure its implementation will usher in an era of development, guaranteeing the progress and prosperity of the nation,” he added.
Majid informed the House that Rs 261.2bn for recurring expenditures would be met entirely from the AJK’s revenue receipts.
Giving details of these receipts, he said Rs67.477bn would be generated through income tax collection, Rs 17.522bn from other taxes, Rs25bn from internal receipts, Rs1bn from water-use charges and Rs1.2bn from capital receipts (loans and advances). A major chunk of income — Rs149bn — would come from the AJK’s share in federal taxes (variable grant).
Of the development budget, the finance minister informed that its volume was Rs49bn, including a foreign component of Rs1bn.
AJK’s development budget is provided by the federal government as a ‘development grant’.
In 2023-24, the federal government had committed Rs30bn for development work in AJK, but the coalition government had announced a Rs42bn development budget, claiming it would generate the remaining Rs12bn from its own resources.
However, by the close of 2023-24, the actual development budget stood at Rs25.835bn.
Similarly, while unveiling the 2024-25 budget, Majid had put the development budget portfolio at Rs44bn, but the revised figures presented today showed it had amounted to only Rs28bn.
Immediately, it remains unclear whether the next fiscal year’s estimated development budget will meet the same fate, or the AJK government will manage to obtain and utilise the full amount of Rs49bn.
The finance minister asserted that despite financial constraints, the government was striving to support its employees, and announced an increase in their pay and pensions “in accordance with what had been declared by the federal government”.
As he concluded his speech and was about to present the budgetary demands, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir and the party’s senior leader Raja Farooq Haider took turns questioning the rationale behind the hasty passage of the budget.
“This House is supposed to hold a debate on each and every aspect of the budget. The parliament and all four provincial assemblies are discussing their budgets. I wonder what problem the government has with holding a debate … This is not a healthy tradition,” remarked Qadir.
Haider urged the government not to make a mockery of the system by using the “brute force of majority” in the House.
“There are no unusual circumstances, such as war, natural calamities or internal disturbances, that can justify this hastiness,” he said.
However, despite their objections, the finance minister proceeded to present the demands for grants, prompting the duo, along with their party colleague Chaudhry Ismail, to walk out of the hall in protest.
The House approved all 32 and 23 demands for grants under the recurring and development budgets, respectively. The minister also presented the demands for grants under the revised budget for the current fiscal year, which were subsequently approved by the House.
After the AJK Finance Act 2025 was also referred to the relevant select committee, the chair adjourned the House until June 23.
A week earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the proposed budget for the FY2025-26 on the floor of the National Assembly.
On Tuesday, AJK cabinet approved the development and non-development budget FY2025–26, along with the Finance Bill 2025.
During the meeting, the finance secretary briefed the cabinet on the revised estimates for the current fiscal year and the proposed allocations for 2025–26, while the secretary of inland revenue presented details of the Finance Bill 2025.
Speaking on the occasion, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said a people-friendly budget was essential to address public grievances and promote inclusive development.</p><small>2025-06-18 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18192515e7fc163.jpg?r=193819' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/i-may-do-it-i-may-not-do-it-trump-says-on-us-striking-iran-as-khamenei-rules-out-surrender' target='_blank'><strong>‘I may do it, I may not do it,’ Trump says on US striking Iran as Khamenei rules out surrender</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump left the question of whether the United States will join Israeli strikes on Iran up in the air on Wednesday, as he said that Tehran had reached out to seek negotiations.
“I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do,” Trump told reporters as he supervised the installation of a new flagpole on the White House South Lawn.
Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised message that the country “will stand firm against an imposed war, just as it will stand firm against an imposed peace” as the archfoes entered their sixth day of war.
Israel launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on Friday, killing top commanders, scientists, and civilians. It claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

Addressing reporters about whether the US would enter the fray after his earlier comments, Trump said: “I can tell you this, Iran’s got a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate.”
Trump said Iran had even suggested sending officials to the White House to negotiate on Tehran’s nuclear program to end Israel’s air assault, but added that it was “very late”. “I said it’s very late to be talking. We may meet. There’s a big difference between now and a week ago, right? Big difference,” Trump added.
“They’ve suggested that they come to the White House. That’s, you know, courageous, but it’s, like, not easy for them to do.”
He reiterated his demand for an “unconditional surrender” from Iran, saying: “I’ve had it. I give up. No more. Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that is all over the place there [in Iran].”
Trump said the next week would be “very big” without elaborating. When asked if it was too late for negotiations, he said: “Nothing is too late.”
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said, even as he declined to confirm preparations of strike options on Iran, that the US military was “prepared to execute” any decision Trump might make on matters of war and peace.
“If and when those decisions are made, the Department [of Defence] is prepared to execute them,” Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Iran later denied it had offered to send officials to Washington.
“No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House,” Iran’s mission to the UN said in a post on X.
“The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out’ Iran’s supreme leader.”
 






Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also spoke to Al Jazeera about reports of a negotiating team dispatched to Oman and said: “This report is not true and Iran has not sent any negotiating team to Muscat.”
Israeli newspaper Haaretz had reported that three Iranian government planes, including the presidential plane, had landed in Oman for “reasons unknown”.
Meanwhile, Khamenei said: “This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,” according to Tasnim news agency.
The Iranian leader also pointed out to statements made by Trump, saying that those who know Iran and its history “know that Iranians do not answer well to the language of threat”.
“And the Americans should know that any US military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable consequences.”
Earlier, Iran claimed firing hypersonic missiles at Israel as Khamenei vowed his country would show “no mercy” to its longtime archfoe, hours after Trump demanded Tehran’s “unconditional surrender”.
“We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy,” Khamenei posted on X, hours after Trump’s escalatory remarks.
 






Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Bahreini, said his country had conveyed to Washington that it will respond firmly to the United States if it becomes directly involved in Israel’s military campaign.
Bahreini told reporters that he saw the US as “complicit in what Israel is doing”. Iran would set a red line, and respond if the US crosses it, he said, without specifying what actions would provoke a response.
“We will not show any reluctance in defending our people, security and land — we will respond seriously and strongly, without restraint,” Bahreini told reporters.
The Iranian envoy called Trump’s remarks “completely unwarranted and very hostile”. “We cannot ignore them. We are vigilant about what Trump is saying. We will put it in our calculations and assessments.”
“I am confident that [Iran’s military] will react strongly, proportionally and appropriately. We are closely following the level of involvement in the US […] We will react whenever it is needed,” he asserted.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said  Iran had the “legitimate” right to defend itself in the face of Israel’s ongoing bombing campaign.
“It is a very natural, legitimate and legal right for Iran to defend itself against Israel’s thuggery and state terrorism,” the Turkish leader said, a day after he referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “the biggest threat to the security of the region”.
The US has so far only taken indirect actions in the current conflict with Iran, including helping to shoot down missiles fired toward Israel. It is deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes, three US officials told Reuters.
Trump met with his National Security Council earlier today to discuss the conflict, ending after an hour and 20 minutes with no immediate public statement.
While he has repeatedly vowed to avoid wading into the “forever wars” of the Middle East, Trump ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the region along with a number of US military aircraft.
US officials stressed he has not yet made a decision about any intervention, according to AFP.
Thomas Massie from Trump’s Republican Party said that he introduced an Iran War Powers Resolution with fellow lawmaker Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war.
“This is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our constitution,” he said. Democratic Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greg Casar were among several lawmakers who voiced their support for the resolution.
 






The most likely option under consideration by Trump would be the use of giant US “bunker-buster” bombs against Iran’s deeply buried Fordow nuclear facility that Israel’s bombs cannot reach.
“Bunker buster” is a broad term used to describe bombs that can penetrate about 61 metres below the surface before exploding, according to the Associated Press. Therefore, the precision-guided bombs are used to attack “deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels”.
The BBC’s Frank Gardner termed it the “30,000lb question”; the US has them but Israel does not, he noted. The New York Times said Trump was also considering allowing US tanker aircraft to refuel Israeli combat jets so they could carry out long-range missions.
A large majority of Americans say the United States should not get involved in the fighting, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll.
Sixty per cent of those surveyed say they do not support US involvement in the hostilities, while 16pc say they back it, according to Newsmax. The rest of 24pc said they were unsure whether they supported American military action.
Death toll in Iran rises to nearly 600: rights group
Washington-based group Human Rights Activists put the total death toll in Iran at 585 people, with 1,326 other wounded, Washington Post reported. The group added that it had identified 239 of those killed in Israeli strikes as civilians and 126 as security personnel.
In its last update on Monday, Iran’s health ministry had said 224 Iranians had been killed and over 1,000 injured, most of them civilians.
So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel, more than 800 have been wounded and over 3,800 have been evacuated from their homes, CNN quoted a statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying.
Iran has launched more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones towards Israel since Friday, the office said. It added that the strikes have hit 40 sites across Israel, resulting in nearly 19,000 damage claims submitted to the tax authority.
Israeli military strikes have hit two facilities in Iran that made parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, identifying them as the Tesa Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Centre.
“At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested. At Karaj, two buildings were destroyed where different centrifuge components were manufactured,” the IAEA said on X.
 






Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that hypersonic missiles were used during the latest attack on Israel.
“The 11th wave of the proud Operation Honest Promise 3 using Fattah-1 missiles” was carried out, the IRGC said in a statement carried by state television, claiming that Iranian forces “have gained complete control over the skies of the occupied territories”.
Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.
 






Iran also sent a “swarm of drones” towards Israel, where the army said it intercepted two over the Dead Sea area. The Israeli military said two barrages of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel in the first two hours of Wednesday morning. Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv.
Israel told residents in the area of Tehran to evacuate so its air force could strike Iranian military installations.
Iranian news websites said Israel was also attacking a university linked to the IRGC in the country’s east, and the Khojir ballistic missile facility near Tehran, which was also targeted by Israeli airstrikes last October.
An Israeli military official claimed 50 fighter jets struck around 20 targets in Tehran overnight, including sites producing raw materials, components and manufacturing systems for missiles.
Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency reported clashes earlier today between security forces and unidentified gunmen in the city of Rey, south of Tehran, adding the assailants may be linked to Israel and intended to carry out “terrorist operations in densely populated areas of the capital”.
The IRGC last night claimed hitting a “major centre” of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency in Tel Aviv, Tasnim reported.
Iran’s police forces intercepted 14 drones and identified hostile drone-producing workshops and drone-carrying vehicles across various provinces, police spokesperson Saeed Montazerolmahdi said today, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency.
On the other hand, Israel is running low on defensive “Arrow” missile interceptors, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unnamed US official, raising concerns about the country’s ability to counter long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A cyberattack yesterday crippled Sepah Bank, one of Iran’s main state-owned banks, the Fars news agency reported.
With air raid sirens regularly screaming over Tel Aviv, some people relocated to an underground parking lot below a shopping mall.
“We’ve decided to permanently set camp here until it’s all clear, I guess,” 30-year-old Mali Papirany told AFP.
Iran also said it had detained five suspected Mossad agents on charges of tarnishing the country’s image online, Iranian news agencies reported.
“These mercenaries sought to sow fear among the public and tarnish the image of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic of Iran through their calculated activities online,” the Tasnim and Isna news agencies quoted a statement from the IRGC as saying.
They added that the arrests had been made in the western province of Lorestan.
France plans European ‘initiative’ to end Iran-Israel conflict
France is planning along with European partners to suggest a negotiated solution to end the conflict between Iran and Israel, the country’s presidency said after President Emmanuel Macron chaired a national security council meeting.
Macron at the meeting ordered Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot to draw up in the coming days “an initiative with close European partners that would propose a demanding negotiated settlement to put an end to the conflict”, the presidency said in a statement, without giving details on the nature of the plan.
Macron urged Israel to end strikes on targets in Iran not linked to nuclear activities or ballistic missiles, his office said.
Addressing a national security council meeting, he “noted his concern over the current escalation, with Israeli strikes increasingly hitting targets not linked to Iran’s nuclear or ballistic programme, and a mounting number of civilian victims in Iran and Israel”, it said.
Macron said it was “necessary to urgently end these military operations, which pose significant threats to regional security”.
Evacuations from Iran, Israel continue
Thousands of people were fleeing Tehran on Wednesday after Trump said yesterday they should leave the capital, Reuters reported.
Authorities have placed limits on how much fuel can be purchased. Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad told state TV that restrictions were in place to prevent shortages but there would be no problem supplying fuel to the public.
Meanwhile, more countries started evacuating their nationals from Iran and Israel.
Britain said it was temporarily withdrawing the family members of staff who work at the country’s embassy and consulate in Israel due to the significant risks posed by the conflict.
“Family members of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv and the British consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn as a precautionary measure,” Britain’s foreign office said on its travel advice page for Israel.
“The embassy and consulate continue with essential work including services to British nationals,” it added.
The families of Russian diplomats left Israel as well, Russia’s ambassador to Tel Aviv Anatoly Viktorov was quoted as saying by Times of Israel.
Over 770 Pakistani pilgrims and students have already returned home, as of Monday.
 


China’s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said 791 of its nationals “have been relocated from Iran to safe areas”, adding some Chinese nationals have also safely evacuated from Israel.
The first batch of Chinese citizens departed from Tehran via land route into Turkmenistan on Tuesday, according to China News Service.
The Japanese government has also started making arrangements to send a military plane to Djibouti as part of its effort to help Japanese nationals in Iran and Israel evacuate, commercial broadcaster Fuji Television Network said.
Greece has repatriated 105 of its citizens and foreign nationals from Israel, its foreign ministry said.
“The people repatriated were transported to Athens from Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt, onboard C-130 and C-27 Greek air force planes,” the ministry said in a statement.
Along with Greek citizens and their families, other people on the flight included citizens of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, it said.

Flights took off for Israel today from Cyprus, ferrying home Israelis stranded abroad during the conflict with Iran, Reuters reported, citing airport sources and web flight tracking sites.
Israel’s airspace has been closed since the two countries began trading attacks on Friday, stranding tens of thousands whose flights to Tel Aviv were cancelled.
Israel announced special flights for the repatriation of its nationals on Tuesday. Its Transportation Ministry has said as many as 150,000 Israelis are abroad, with about a third trying to get home.
According to a report by Israeli publication Haaretz, the marina in Herzliya — a coastal town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv — and others like it in Haifa and Ashkelon, are now becoming gathering spots for many who want to leave Israel using flotillas.
Trump says ‘we now have total control’ of Iran skies
In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump’s increasingly irate tone and choice of words indicated that the US was not far from intervening to support Israel, its closest ally in the region.
“We now have completely and total control of the skies over Iran,” he posted, prompting many to question what he meant by “we”.
The US president has maintained that his country is not involved in the Iran-Israel conflict yet, but threatened Iran with severe consequences if it targeted US troops and assets in the Middle East.
He then posted “unconditional surrender”, an apparent demand addressed at Tehran.
Trump also made a veiled threat against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying “we know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding … We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”.
 


Trump’s sometimes contradictory and cryptic messaging about the conflict between close US ally Israel and longtime foe Iran has deepened the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. His public comments have ranged from military threats to diplomatic overtures, not uncommon for a president known for an often erratic approach to foreign policy.
Reuters reported yesterday that the US military was deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes.
The deployments include F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, and officials said had so far been used to shoot down drones and projectiles targeting Israel.
Four US Stratofortress bombers are currently stationed at a remote US base in the Indian Ocean, an AFP analysis of satellite imagery indicated. The four B52H bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons or other precision-guided munitions, were spotted on a southern tarmac at Diego Garcia on Monday at 2:22pm PKT.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also described the deployments as defensive in nature. A White House official said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Tuesday.
The US already has a sizeable force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops in the region, including air defence systems, fighter aircraft and warships that can detect and shoot down enemy missiles.
 
 

British PM Keir Starmer, speaking at the Group of Seven nations summit in Canada that Trump left early, said there was no indication the US was about to enter the conflict.
The US said that it will close its embassy in Jerusalem until Friday amid the growing military conflict between Israel and Iran, as speculation mounts about possible American intervention.
“Given the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20),” the embassy said in a statement posted on Tuesday to its website.
Regional influence weakens
Khamenei’s main military and security advisers have been killed by Israeli strikes, hollowing out his inner circle and raising the risk of strategic errors, according to five people familiar with his decision-making process.
With Iranian leaders suffering their most dangerous security breach since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the country’s cybersecurity command banned officials from using communications devices and mobile phones, Fars news agency reported.
State television appealed to Iranians on Tuesday to delete WhatsApp from their phones, charging that the messaging app gathers users’ location and personal data and “communicates them to the Zionist enemy”.

Israel launched its air war, its largest ever on Iran, on Friday after saying it concluded Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has pointed to its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Netanyahu has stressed that he will not back down until Iran’s nuclear development is disabled, while Trump says the Israeli assault could end if Iran agrees to strict curbs on enrichment.
Before Israel’s attack began, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
 
 

The IAEA said on Tuesday that an Israeli strike directly hit the underground enrichment halls at the Natanz facility.
Israel says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days. But Israel will struggle to deal a knock-out blow to deeply buried nuclear sites like Fordow, which is dug beneath a mountain, without the US joining the attack.
Global oil markets are on high alert following strikes on sites including the world’s biggest gas field, South Pars, shared by Iran and Qatar.</p><small>2025-06-18 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1822041330744a4.jpg?r=220512' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917939/two-gunned-down-for-honour-one-assailant-dead-police-say' target='_blank'><strong>Two gunned down for ‘honour’; one assailant dead, police say</strong></a><br><p>Two men were shot dead while a third was injured in what police described as an ‘honour’ killing in Karachi’s Ittehad Town on Wednesday, while in a separate incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a young man was also killed for the same reason, according to a first information report (FIR).
In Karachi, Deputy Inspector General South, Syed Asad Raza, told Dawn.com that the incident occurred around 4am at a house near Khyber Chowk in the Ittehad Town neighbourhood. Two brothers and a nephew of a woman’s former husband allegedly scaled the boundary wall of her home.
“The woman’s current husband and the intruders exchanged gunfire,” he said, adding that the husband was fatally shot.
“The nephew was also killed in the shootout, while the current husband’s brother was injured,” DIG Raza added. “The two other suspects fled the scene.”
During the initial probe, the police discovered that the deceased man had married a woman from the Tank district in KP. The couple was living in a rented house at Khyber Chowk in Ittehad Town.
According to the DIG, police recovered 22 spent bullet casings, a 30-bore pistol and two mobile phones from the crime scene.
“Both the [deceased] husband’s injured brother and the woman have been taken into custody for interrogation,” he added, stating that the bodies and the injured were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.
Ittehad Town Police Station House Officer Rao Shabbir said that the woman had married the deceased three months ago, adding that the double murder appeared to be a case of ‘honour’ killing.
Meanwhile, in another incident, it emerged on Wednesday that a young man had been gunned down in KP’s Martung tehsil on June 15, also in the name of ‘honour’.
Puran circle sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Usman Munir, told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Kotkay area, where a 17-year-old boy was killed.
“The victim’s father stated in the FIR that his son was shot dead in their home,” Munir said.
In the FIR, which is available with Dawn.com, the victim’s father identified his son’s alleged attacker.
“A girl from the suspect’s family had left her house with my son,” the complainant alleged. “Since then, the girl’s family had been searching for him.”
In response to a question, SDPO Munir said that the girl was sent to Darul Aman after the incident, as her safety was also at risk.
“Some of the suspects have been arrested, but the main suspect is still at large,” he told Dawn.com. “However, police parties are conducting raids to arrest him.”
When asked about whether the incident was an ‘honour’ killing, the SDPO said that the FIR was initially registered under Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“Later in the investigation, Section 311 (discretionary punishment) can be added for the honour killing,” Munir said.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-06-18 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18223129573bf89.jpg?r=225302' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917941/baby-born-to-brain-dead-us-woman-kept-alive-due-to-abortion-law' target='_blank'><strong>Baby born to brain-dead US woman kept alive due to abortion law</strong></a><br><p>A brain-dead pregnant woman who was kept alive in the southern US state of Georgia due to local abortion restrictions has given birth, officials said, with the mother then removed from life support.
Adriana Smith had captivated attention across a country where access to abortion has changed radically since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to terminate a pregnancy in June 2022.
“On Friday, June 13, 2025, her infant son, named Chance, was born prematurely at approximately 4:41 am via emergency Cesarean section,” three Democratic congresswomen said in a statement.
“Chance weighs about 1 pound, 13 ounces and is currently in the NICU,” the statement said, adding that Smith was removed from life support on Tuesday.
Smith, a registered nurse, was suffering serious headaches in February when she was nine weeks pregnant. An initial hospital visit ended with only a prescription for medication.
The next morning, when the then 30-year-old was taken to the hospital where she worked, doctors found multiple blood clots in her brain, and she was declared brain dead.
Georgia law bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — one of the country’s so-called ‘heartbeat’ laws, referring to the approximate first detection of a fetal heartbeat.
As Smith was nine weeks along, doctors were hesitant to do anything that could contravene the law, according to her mother, April Newkirk.
“This decision should’ve been left to us,” she told local NBC broadcaster WXIA-TV in mid-May. “I’m not saying that we would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy, what I’m saying is: we should have had a choice,” Newkirk said.
 


In June 2022, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 case that established federal protections for abortion access. Since then, more than 20 out of 50 states, including Georgia, have imposed strict limits on abortions, or even outright bans.
The three congresswomen — Nikema Williams, Ayanna Pressley and Sara Jacobs — are pushing for better protections of the rights of pregnant women, “particularly black women, who are disproportionately impacted by systemic medical neglect and restrictive anti-abortion laws.
“The lack of a formal legal opinion or prosecutorial guidance leaves families and doctors in limbo,” said the lawmakers, who have presented a congressional resolution on the issue.</p><small>2025-06-18 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/181122244715906.jpg?r=121905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917876/karachi-millennium-mall-fire-still-burning-fuelled-by-flammable-material-rescue-official' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Millennium Mall fire still burning, fuelled by flammable material: rescue official</strong></a><br><p>Firefighters have been unable to completely put out the massive blaze that erupted in Karachi’s Millennium Mall on Tuesday night, as inflammable items stored in shops continue to reignite the flames.
Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com on Wednesday evening that 12 fire tenders attempted to control the blaze after seven hours of hectic efforts.
However, he noted that the blaze has not been completely extinguished, as clothes and other goods kept inside hundreds of destroyed shops are still fuelling the blaze.
“We are expecting to continue firefighting operations until Wednesday night because of the presence of clothes, cell phones, gaming zones and other items,” Khan said. “Firefighters are searching every shop and are extinguishing any flames that are reignited.”
Responding to a question, the Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a fire safety system in the mall, but it was not functional.
“When the firefighters attempted to use the fire suppression system, it could not be operationalised,” he said, adding that there was no ventilation and the system was found to be “inactive”.
Earlier, the spokesperson said, “The rescue team arrived at the mall within 15 minutes of receiving information of the fire at 4:06am. There, a security guard informed them that the fire had erupted inside surveillance system of a control room due to a short circuit on the third floor.”
The spokesperson was of the view that perhaps the mall management had initially overlooked the fire.
When the firemen arrived there, the fire had spread onto the roof of the mall, where chillers were being kept as it was centrally air conditioned. This intensified the fire and heavy flames emanating from it touched the windows of the nearby Saima Mall and Residency building, triggering fears of a fire there.
 
 

“However, 12 fire tenders, with the help of two snorkels, managed to control the fire after hectic efforts lasting for several hours. Cooling work is continuing,” he said.
Khan added it might take two more hours to completely extinguish the fire. He elaborated that the fire has been extinguished by up to 90 per cent, adding that it is taking a long time because of the presence of large objects inside shops. Firefighters are searching every shop to extinguish any flames there.
He said that the third floor of the three-storey building was completely destroyed, while the first and second floor were partially damaged. There were more than 150 shops on each floor.
He estimated that around 500-600 shops were badly destroyed, causing significant financial losses, but no injuries were reported.
Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.  In November of 2023, city planners, engineers and experts of building plans at a symposium were sure that some 90 per cent of all structures in Karachi — residential, commercial and industrial — did not have a fire prevention and firefighting system.
Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February. Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation, and 12 firefighters worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.
Last year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.
Out of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.
Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p><small>2025-06-18 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1821063532df7cc.jpg?r=210724' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917937/india-is-a-perpetrator-of-foreign-interference-canadian-intelligence-agency-says' target='_blank'><strong>India is a perpetrator of foreign interference, Canadian intelligence agency says</strong></a><br><p>India is a perpetrator of foreign interference, Canada’s intelligence agency said in a report published on Wednesday, just after India’s and Canada’s prime ministers vowed to strengthen ties at a global summit hosted by Canada.

Carney drew outrage from some members of Canada’s Sikh community when he invited Modi to the G7.
 
 

Canada-India relations have been tense since former prime minister Justin Trudeau in 2023 accused India’s government of involvement in the June 18, 2023, murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.
Modi’s government has denied involvement in Nijjar’s killing and has accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
The intelligence report noted transnational repression “plays a central role in India’s activity in Canada”, though it said China poses the greatest counter-intelligence threat to Canada and also named Russia, Iran and Pakistan.
 






The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in October that they had communicated more than a dozen threats to Sikhs advocating for the creation of a homeland carved out of India.
“Indian officials, including their Canada-based proxy agents, engage in a range of activities that seek to influence Canadian communities and politicians,” the Canadian Security Intelligence Service report reads.
“These activities attempt to steer Canada’s positions into alignment with India’s interests on key issues, particularly with respect to how the Indian government perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent homeland that they call Khalistan.”
The Indian High Commission and the Chinese embassy in Canada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><small>2025-06-18 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/182000562b78ed7.jpg?r=204034' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917933/intense-heat-in-kp-impacted-935-people-in-june-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Intense heat in KP impacted 935 people in June: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 935 people have been impacted by theextreme heat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this month, rescue officials said on Wednesday.
Climate change is a pressing reality for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.
According to Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi, “The ongoing heatwave across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reached alarming levels, affecting both human lives and the environment.”
He told Dawn.com that, “A total of 935 people were impacted by the intense heatwave in June, of which 48 were taken to hospitals in critical condition due to heat-related health complications.”
He added that to mitigate the impact of the heatwave, Rescue 1122 has established 108 anti-heatwave camps across 34 districts of the province.
“The camps are equipped with first aid and hydration facilities to provide immediate relief to those suffering from heat exhaustion or heatstroke,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad told Dawn.com, “We have provided necessary facilities in these camps, including first aid and proper hydration support, to help the affected population.”
He said that the intense heat has caused a spike in forest fires across KP.
“This month, 65 forest fire incidents were reported, with the districts of Lower Dir and Abbottabad being the most affected ones — each reporting 14 separate fire incidents,” he added.
 
 

He continued, “In light of the ongoing heatwave, the provincial government has issued public safety advisories, urging citizens to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, minimise physical exertion during peak heat hours, and stay hydrated.”
Fahad said that the authorities were urging the public to adhere strictly to safety guidelines and cooperate with emergency services to prevent further loss of life and property, as the region grapples with the threat of severe heat and environmental hazards.
“We are coordinating closely with district administrations to address and control forest fire outbreaks.”
Pakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.
Last month, a massive wildfire that erupted in the mountains of KP’s Adenzai continued to spread, even as efforts were ongoing to put out the raging flames, which damaged precious forests in the previous three days.
Adenzai is a mountainous forest zone located in the Lower Dir district where a wildfire broke out in May last year as well and continued to burn for four to five days.</p><small>2025-06-18 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/181902318f8cdfc.jpg?r=190744' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917930/three-pakistani-schools-shortlisted-for-worlds-best-school-prizes' target='_blank'><strong>Three Pakistani schools shortlisted for World’s Best School Prizes</strong></a><br><p>Three Pakistani schools — two in Lahore and one in Quetta — have been shortlisted for the World’s Best School Prizes 2025, according to a press release issued by the award’s founder, T4 Education, on Wednesday.
T4 said in a press release that the five awards are “the world’s most prestigious education prizes” and winners are chosen “by an expert judging academy based on rigorous criteria”. The awards are for Community Collaboration, Environmental Action, Innovation, Overcoming Adversity and Supporting Healthy Lives.
Sanjan Nagar Public Education Trust Higher Secondary School, Nordic International School from Lahore, and the Beaconhouse College Programme’s Juniper Campus in Quetta are the three shortlisted Pakistani institutions.
“All 50 finalist schools across the five prizes will also take part in a public vote, which opened today, to determine the winner of the Community Choice Award,” the press release read. “All six winners will be announced in October.”
According to T4, Sanjan Nagar — a charity-run primary and secondary school — has made it to the final 10 for the World’s Best School Prize for Overcoming Adversity.
The school, based in Lahore’s Glaxo Town, has “trailblazed the adoption of the IB (International Baccalaureate) and PYP (Primary Years Programme) curriculum, an inquiry-based approach based on a sustainable and inclusive model that empowers marginalised children with critical 21st century skills”, the press release stated.
T4 said that the school, which started in an abandoned factory, now has a campus with over 800 students.
The Nordic International School, also based in Lahore, was shortlisted for the World’s Best School Prize for Community Collaboration, according to the statement.
T4 described the school as an “independent kindergarten, primary and secondary school … which is actively involving parents as architects of their children’s academic success, supported by a culture of kindness to create a happy and supportive learning environment where students thrive”.
Meanwhile, Beaconhouse’s Juniper Campus in Quetta has been shortlisted for “breaking the barriers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education for children in underprivileged rural areas by giving them access to interactive, real-world science education with ‘Science Gaari’, a fully equipped and student-led mobile science lab”, T4 said.
The institution, which was launched in collaboration with Unicef, was also shortlisted for the World’s Best School Prize for Community Collaboration, the press release stated.
T4 said that the winners and finalists will also attend the World Schools Summit in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, from November 15-16, where they will share their best practices and unique expertise and experience with policymakers and leading figures in global education“.
Vika Pota, the founder of T4, was quoted as saying, “In a world being turned upside down by AI, as technology reshapes the way we learn and renders jobs that have existed for centuries obsolete, amid growing challenges of climate change, conflict, poverty and populism, the world our young people are entering has never felt more precarious.”
He emphasised that a good education with humans at its heart has “never been more important”.
Mentioning the three finalists, Pota highlighted that they have demonstrated “innovations and expertise” that give hope for the future and said that the world has “so much to learn” from the three schools.
Despite this achievement, the education sector in Pakistan is struggling.
For fiscal year 2025-26, the federal government earmarked a Rs66.4 billion recurring budget (non-development expenditure including salaries and pensions) for the higher education sector against the demand of Rs84.6 billion put up by the Higher Education Commission.
In January this year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lamented that over 22 million children are out of school in Pakistan and emphasised the urgent need for Muslim countries to prioritise girls’ education.
He said millions of young girls will enter the job market over the next decade, emphasising that they “have the potential not just to lift themselves, their families and nations out of poverty but also to enrich the global economy”.</p><small>2025-06-18 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18185443497973b.jpg?r=185529' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917920/two-killed-one-injured-during-shooting-in-karachis-ittehad-town-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two killed, one injured during shooting in Karachi’s Ittehad Town: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and one was injured during a shooting incident in Karachi’s Ittehad Town, police said on Wednesday.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com, “The incident occurred inside a house near Amir Muawiyah Mosque. Police have detained two people from the site of the incident, recovering a 30-bore pistol from there. A woman was being investigated.”
DIG Raza added that the exchange of fire occurred due to “personal enmity between the two sides.”
According to the preliminary investigation, a man brought a married woman from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district to Karachi, he said.
“The firing exchange took place after the woman’s husband and brothers arrived at the scene to take her back,” he added.
He further said that two people died on the spot and another person, sustaining bullet injuries, was arrested.
“The crime scene unit is at the scene and evidence is being collected,” he said, adding that the bodies of the deceased have been taken to the Civil Hospital for postmortem.
DIG Raza said that further legal action and the search for the suspects were underway.
Last month, two suspects on a motorcycle shot dead]1 a man in the Defence Housing Authority area of the metropolis. Police ruled out the possibility of a robbery attempt and suggested that the murder might be an outcome of a personal enmity.

Assistant spokesperson to the Lakki Marwar’s district police officer, Qudratullah, said, “The explosion triggered a fire and caused a massive gas leak. The pipeline was attacked in the Torwah seasonal stream area, which provided cover for the perpetrators.”
Calling the incident a “major act of sabotage”, Qudratullah added: The khawarij (terrorist) operatives targeted a key gas pipeline from the Bettani Gas Field to Punjab, using explosives to destroy a main section of the line.“
“Soon after the blast, security forces were dispatched to the site and cordoned off the area,” Qudratullah further said, adding that emergency teams had also been mobilised to control the fire and assess the extent of the damage.
“Investigations are underway to identify and apprehend those involved in the attack,” he said. “Officials have condemned the incident as an assault on critical national infrastructure aimed at destabilising the region and disrupting essential energy supplies.”
 
 

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.
Earlier this month, three terrorists were killed in the district’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was also martyred.
In May, the police and the commandos of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) launched a joint operation against terrorists in rural areas of the district.</p><small>2025-06-18 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18130702539c03d.png?r=131959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917884/careem-announces-end-of-ride-hailing-service-in-pakistan-from-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>Careem announces end of ride-hailing service in Pakistan from next month</strong></a><br><p>Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service operations in Pakistan from July after nearly a decade in the industry, its CEO announced on Wednesday, adding that its journey in the country would continue “in a different role”.
Mudassir Sheikha, Careem’s CEO and co-founder, shared a post on LinkedIn announcing “a new chapter” for the company.
“It is with a heavy heart that I share this update: Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service in Pakistan on July 18,” Sheikha said, adding that it was “an incredibly difficult decision.”
“The challenging macroeconomic reality, intensifying competition, and global capital allocation made it hard to justify the investment levels required to deliver a safe and dependable service in the country.
“In the end, the Careem Rides team had to make this tough call,” he said.
 





He called the ride suspension “the end of an iconic chapter — one built with purpose, grit and a ton of relentless hustle”.
Sheikha highlighted some of Careem’s notable achievements while operating in Pakistan, including safe rides on demand, women travelling with strangers, and smartphones and digital payments for everyday use.
“The challenges were real and formidable. But our Pakistan team was brilliant and fearless — bold, determined, and literally on a mission to create millions of jobs for captains across the country,” he said.
He lauded his team for building a service that millions of Pakistanis relied on “to move and earn”.
“They delivered significant public goods: digital infrastructure, trust, regulation, capability, confidence — all of which paved the way for countless local and global digital ventures to take root in Pakistan.”
Sheikha added that “while ride-hailing is sunsetting, Careem’s journey in Pakistan continues in a different role.
“Careem Technologies (the spinout building the Everything App) will continue to build from Pakistan for the region.”
Sheikha said that nearly 400 Careem employees from across all functions, including engineering, are building the Everything App and its ecosystem of verticals (food/grocery delivery, payments, and more).
“This presence is only set to grow, with over 100 open roles and the expansion of our Falcon/NextGen programme that brings in top graduates from Pakistani universities and gives them hands-on training on building highly scalable systems,” Sheikha elaborated.
“Pakistan is in Careem’s DNA — our first line of code was written here, and the country remains a rich source of innovation and talent for us,” he said.
The company said Careem Care will be available till September 18 to help users with any pending issues or questions, according to an update sent to a Dawn.com staffer who uses the app.
“If you have remaining balance in your Careem Wallet, we’ll be in touch soon with clear instructions on how to reclaim it,” the update said.
In April 2024, Uber made the decision to cease operating its ride-hailing app in Pakistan, saying: “Our subsidiary brand Careem will continue to operate, with the Careem app offering ride-hailing services across Pakistan and earning opportunities for drivers.”
Careem officially entered the Pakistani market in October 2015, offering an app, a website and a helpline where customers could order rides. It operates in 12 countries across the Middle East and North Africa, Turkiye and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-18 09:29</small></div><hr>
