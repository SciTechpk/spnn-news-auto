The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgham terrorist attack, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
“We stand with the victim’s families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity, and we want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces,” the Indian skipper said.
Speaking at the post-match press conference, Yadav said: “Our government and the BCCI were aligned. We took a call and came here just to play the game and gave them (Pakistan) a proper reply.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha was not present at the post-match ceremony.
 






Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason the Pakistani captain was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
 


Earlier, it was a clinical performance by the Men in Blue after the Indian spinners ruled the roost in the first innings and Pakistan stumbled to 127-9 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-19 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons throughout the match.

Over 15 — Ind - 123-3
Yadav looking to finish things off quickly as he lifts Saim for four. Dube ends the over with a massive six and it looks likely Saim will finish as Pakistan’s most successful bowler with figures of 3-35 off four overs. India need five more to win.

Over 14 — Ind - 110-3
13.4: The Indian skipper Yadav cuts Nawaz for four in a statement of authority!
Frustration for Pakistan on the second ball as Yadav flashes, but the ball falls short of point and goes for four. The India skipper adds to the misery by cutting Nawaz for four past the same fielder two balls later. Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Mid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim:
Pakistan need a miracle. India are coasting in the chase, there is no run-rate pressure, and Pakistan are having difficulty in exerting spells of sustained pressure. The Green Shirts need quick wickets if they are to have any chance.

Over 10 — Ind - 88-2
9.1: Verma launches Sufyan for six!

India is eating into Pakistan’s total. Required rate dips below five as the powerplay ends with Men in Blue at 61.

Over 4 — Ind - 42-2
3.4: Saim has struck again!
Just when Abhishek Sharma looked like becoming a thorn in Pakistan’s ambitions of getting wickets and stopping the run flow, Saim struck. It was a case of one too many for the left-handed. Having hit back-to-back fours off Saim, he went for another and was caught at long-off.
 


Tilak Verma now at the crease. Only eight runs off the over. Saim looks keen to turn it around for Pakistan with the ball.

Over 3 — Ind - 33-1
Sharma v Shaheen again, and the Indian opener gets a four first-ball, slashing a wider delivery, and before hitting a monstrous six two balls later.
 


Suryakumar Yadav makes a quiet start. He comes into this match with a patchy record against Pakistan.

Over 2 — Ind - 22-1
Saim Ayub is into the attack; let’s hope he can emulate what the Indian spinners did in the first innings.
1.6: Saim has struck with his carrom ball yet again!
Pakistan is attacking with spin from the get-go, with Saim bowling the second over. Shubman Gill hits him for consecutive fours, but it’s one too many as he is stumped off the last ball. Pakistan have the wicket they wanted!

Over 1 — Ind - 12-0
0.1: Newbie Abhishek Sharma welcomes Shaheen Afridi with a boundary off the very first ball of the over.
India get off to a flier. Sharma smashed the first ball back past Shaheen for four and deposited the second ball for six over long-off.

He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons in the first innings.
The Green Shirts have something to defend on board, courtesy of four sixes by Shaheen to end the innings.
India will have to contend with Pakistan’s spin trio of Abrar, Sufyan and Nawaz
Will this be an Afridi cameo to remember, or will India gallop home easily? Only time will tell!

Pakistan have something to defend.
Over 19 — Pak - 110-8

Over 13 — Pak - 64-6

12.5: Mohammad Nawaz is gone first ball!
India will probably feel they can bowl Pakistan out in quick time. Kuldeep has once again tormented Pakistan. Two wickets in two balls — first Hasan Nawaz caught and then Mohammad Nawaz lbw. Sahibzada has been in from the start and now has all-rounder Faheem Ashraf for support. They are Pakistan’s last recognised batting pair.

Over 12 — Pak - 62-4
Sahibzada broke the shackles and launched the first ball down the ground for six. But two dot balls followed before Pakistan got two more singles. Runs are coming slowly for Pakistan.

If Fakhar’s departure wasn’t enough, Salman never got going and in an attempt to get quick runs, fell to Patel, who now has two wickets.
Pakistan have to hit out of the spin trap if they are to post a match-saving total. Up to Hasan Nawaz to provide the impetus.

Over 10 — Pak - 49-4
Patel back into the attack as Salman cuts him.
It gets worse for Pakistan. Skipper Salman is caught in the deep.

Chakravarthy continued bowling a nagging line to Salman with just two runs coming off the over.
Over 8 — Pak - 45-3
7.4: Fakhar is gone!
Axar Patel was brought on into the attack and got the big wicket of Fakhar Zaman off the fourth ball he bowled. Fakhar tried to hit him out of the park, but could only find Tilak Verma running in from long-on.
The onus is now on captain Salman Ali Agha to stabilise the innings.

Over 7 — Pak - 43-2

Over 6 — Pak - 42-2

Over 5 — Pak - 34-2
India brings on their first spinner — Varun Chakravarthy
4.3: Fakhar slots Chakravarthy for four down the ground

3.3: Sahibzada smacks Bumrah over wide long-on for a six!
Pakistan’s first six of the innings comes in the 4th over. The early inning jitters are now gone.
 


Another good over with no losses as Sahibzada and Fakhar look to rebuild Pakistan’s innings. Bumrah bowled two good balls to open the over before Sahibzada smashed him for six over long-on. Those were the the only runs in the over but crucially, Pakistan have not lost another wicket.

Over 3 — Pak - 20-2
Pandya is pulled away for a single by Fakhar.
2.3: Pakistan get their first boundary courtesy a pull by Fakhar.
Good over for Pakistan. Two singles came off the first two balls before Fakhar pulled a short one from Pandya for four — Pakistan’s first boundary. Fakhar got another with a drive through the legside off the fifth ball while three runs came from wides.

Over 2 — Pak - 7-2
1.2: Haris gets a top edge and Bumrah strikes. Pandya catches, running in from fine leg.
Pakistan have got off to the worst possible start. India have their tails up. Haris was the standout in the side’s tournament-opener against Oman but now he departs.
 


1.4: It gets worse for Pakistan. Fakhar has been adjudged lbw. The left-hander immediately reviewed
Pakistan get a reprieve, the review shows ball pitching outside leg.

Anthems

The Indian anthem is being played next.
Pakistan openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan make their way to the crease.

Analysis by Dawn’s Umaid Wasim: Pakistan wanted to bat first and set an above-par total. India wanted to bowl first. Both sides will be quite happy with the outcome of the toss. Pakistan, though, face a trial by spin. The pitch is the same as the one for India’s opening match against the UAE. India skipper Suyakumar Yadav said at the toss that batting got easier in the second stanza of the UAE game, and perhaps that is why he wanted his side to be batting second.

An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “We’re very excited for the match.”
According to the captain, Pakistan’s rationale behind batting first is that the surface looks to be on the slower side.
His Indian counterpart, Suryakumar Yadav, said this team was really looking forward to this game.
Both teams are unchanged since their last encounters in the tournament.
Pakistan batter Saim Ayub said on Saturday that the team was not just focusing on the Pakistan-India match, but winning the men’s Asia Cup.
 


While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
The two teams last faced each other in February, in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the ODI format.

The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Pakistan, India, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four stage.
The top two teams will then play the September 28 final in Dubai.

The 21-year-old Seville crossed the finish line in a 9.77 personal best ahead of Thompson in 9.82 and the USA’s reigning champion Noah Lyles, who won bronze with a season’s best 9.89.
“It was a good run because these two actually pushed me to run a personal best,” Seville, the youngest 100m champion, said at the post-race press conference. He became the third Jamaican sprinter to win this title.
“To come out here and run a 9.77 is something amazing, and in Japan is where I made my debut; to get a medal is something great for me.”
 






Jefferson-Wooden came in as the world lead and left Tokyo with a gold medal, proving her superiority to round off a season unbeaten. Tina Clayton continued Jamaica’s podium finish just minutes earlier when she blasted a 10.76 personal best while Olympic champion Julien Alfred took bronze with 10.84.
“This year has been nothing short of a dream. I’ve been working so hard for this moment to come out here and focus on my execution,” 24-year-old Jefferson-Wooden said. “To put on the perfect race at the perfect time, I’m just so happy and grateful.”
 






For Clayton, a medal wasn’t even a goal coming into her first senior championships.
“The goal was to execute,” Clayton told the press conference with a shyness poles apart from the confidence that won her a medal an hour earlier. “Silver was not in my thoughts, but God did so, and I’m grateful.”
The American women led the country’s gold medal rush as Olympic Champions Tara Davis-Woodhall and Valarie Allman were crowned world champions for the first time in the long jump and discus throw, respectively.
 






The men’s 10,000m also saw a rewriting of the script with two European medalists in a sport long dominated by the Ethiopians and Ugandan Joshua Cheptegi. France’s Jimmy Gressier eclipsed Ethiopia’s Yomif Keljecha in the last 10 metres to win gold, with Sweden’s Andreas Almgren taking bronze.
World championship silver medalist Jakob Ingebrigsten suffered a shock exit in the men’s 1500m heats due to an injury.
“I gave it my best today. It just wasn’t enough. I knew this could happen,” the 24-year-old Norwegian said in a post on Instagram soon after. “But giving up isn’t in my nature. I will be back.”
Much like his run at the Paris Olympics, Ingebrigsten could bounce back in the 5,000m — the heats scheduled on his 25th birthday — and win a third world title in the event.

Uruguay won their first medal of the competition and Julia Paternain didn’t even realise it when she crossed the finish line in third.
Earlier in the night in the women’s 100m semi-finals,there was a false start by reigning champion Sha’Carri Richardson. Veteran sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was a shock entrant into the final after a second place finish in her semis.
Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon cruised into the women’s 1500m final (4:00.34) ahead of countrywoman Dorcus Ewoi in 4:00.65. Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu fell in the first 100m of her semi-final but caught up to the pack in a flash and qualified for the final in 4:01.03.

Fair to say Pakistan are a young side undergoing transition under a new captain and a newer team management, but there were enough instances throughout the fixture that highlighted a bigger problem: big-match nerves.
One of those few instances was Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late onslaught of 33 off 16, which included four clean hits for sixes. He and Sufiyan Muqeem added 43 off 22 balls — a strike-rate of 195-plus — to drag Pakistan to 127-9 when it looked like the team wouldn’t even get into three figures. If tailenders can do that, why not the specialist batters?

To put it simply, the pressure of the big occasion got the better of them before India, obviously a well-oiled T20 machine, faced no challenge whatsoever during the chase, which ended with 25 balls to spare.
Backfiring intent
Early wickets may be the unwanted consequence of attacking intent, but against quality oppositions, they pile pressure on the incoming batters, putting them in a shell — shouldn’t be an excuse for them, however.
 
 

It was Saim again who gave the opponents the sniff before they dug in to prey on Pakistan. The left-handed opener should now be worried. The “impact” he is expected to make early on has remained a mere expectation in most of his outings.
Casually driving Jasprit Bumrah on the up didn’t look like a shot that should be played in such a big match after falling on a first-ball duck in the previous game against Oman as well.
Mohammad Haris followed suit not long after, trying to drag Hardik Pandya from outside the off-stump to get caught in the circle and failing to build on to his half-century against Oman.
Sahibzada: lone warrior
Bumrah prevailed as one of, if not the best, exponents of yorkers in the world, but Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44) came up to the task, taking on the right-armer whenever he erred even slightly.
That six, creamed over long-on, and the other, pulled with ease over square-leg, spoke volumes about Sahibzada’s quality — the batter coming into the national side after toiling in domestic cricket. But as wickets fell around him, the right-hander slowed down and the seniors faltered.

Horrendous shot selection
The seniors — Fakhar Zaman with his experience and Salman Ali Agha as captain — were two of six Pakistan batters who threw away their wickets thanks to horrendous shot selection.
While Fakhar went after Axar Patel’s straighter one, Salman failed to execute a sweep shot against the left-arm spinner as both were out caught. Hasan Nawaz met the same fate, playing Kuldeep Yadav across, while Faheem Ashraf’s rash reverse-sweep gave Varun Chakravarthy a wicket.
What Shaheen did towards the end was a big proof that the pitch offered value for genuine shot-making and Pakistan failed to capitalise.
Mighty-dangerous India
Pakistan’s frailties were such that a team like India would punish brutally, and they did.
Suryakumar Yadav’s men back their intent with superb skill level and Abhishek Sharma smashing Shaheen for a four on the first ball of their chase showed they meant business.

Saim did make up for his poor batting once again with three big wickets with the ball, including that of Abhishek, Shubman Gill and Tilak Varma, whose 56-run partnership with Suryakumar took India over the line.
Earlier, it was all about Kuldeep, who has haunted Pakistan with his left-arm wrist-spin over the past few years.
Despite the thumping, it’s not completely over for Pakistan. They are likely to make it to the Super Four stage, where they will meet India again and will have another chance to make it 1-1.</p><small>2025-09-14 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14222732c1df748.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941962/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-not-cooperating-with-authorities-utah-governor-says' target='_blank'><strong>Charlie Kirk shooting suspect not cooperating with authorities, Utah governor says</strong></a><br><p>The man arrested in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is not cooperating with authorities, but investigators are working to establish a motive for the shooting by talking to his friends and family, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said on Sunday.
Cox said the accused gunman, Tyler Robinson, 22, will be formally charged on Tuesday. He remains in custody in Utah.
Investigators have yet to piece together why Robinson allegedly scaled a rooftop at Utah Valley University during an outdoor event and shot Kirk in the neck at long range on Wednesday.
Kirk, a staunch ally of United States President Donald Trump and co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot during the event attended by 3,000 people in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.
  @dawn.today US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination. Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people. The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
The killing ushered in newfound fears of a spike in political violence in the United States and an ever-deepening divide between the left and the right.
Robinson has not confessed to investigators, Cox told the ABC programme ‘This Week’.
“He is not cooperating, but all the people around him were cooperating, and I think that’s very important,” the Republican governor said.
 


One person who is apparently talking to investigators is Robinson’s roommate, who was also a romantic partner, Cox said, citing the FBI. Cox described the roommate as “a male transitioning to female,” and said the roommate has been “incredibly cooperative”.
Reuters has not been able to locate the roommate or representatives for the roommate to seek comment. Reuters could not determine who is serving as Robinson’s legal representative.
Asked on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ programme whether the roommate’s gender identity is relevant to the investigation, Cox said, “That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. It’s easy to draw conclusions from that, and so we’ve got the shell casings, other forensic evidence that is coming in — and trying to piece all of those things together.”
 


Investigators found messages engraved into four bullet casings, which included references to memes and video game in-jokes. An affidavit filed by authorities in the case described these messages.
One of the inscriptions, according to the affidavit, read: “Hey fascist! Catch!” followed by a combination of directional arrows, an apparent reference to a sequence of button presses that unleashes a bomb in popular video game Helldivers II.
Kirk’s charged rhetoric, which often involved anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant comments, attracted legions of conservatives, but also engendered strong feelings from liberals and drew widespread criticism.
Robinson, a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system, was taken into custody at his parents’ house, about 260 miles (420 km) southwest of the crime scene, after a 33-hour manhunt.
Investigators search for motive
Relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Cox said previously.
While Robinson was raised by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ programme, without going into specifics.
 


State records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. A relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.
Robinson was “not a fan” of Kirk’s, Cox said on Sunday.
 
 

The killing has stirred outrage among Kirk’s supporters and condemnation of political violence from some across the ideological spectrum.
Many Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence — even as the president and his allies have often invoked violent imagery against their opponents.
Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, urged calm on Sunday.
“We’ve got to turn the rhetoric down,” Johnson said on the ‘Fox News Sunday’ programme.
 


In conversations he has had with Republican and Democratic House members since Kirk’s killing, Johnson said, “There’s this recognition that people have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy.” But Johnson also criticised Democrats.
“You can’t call the other side fascists and enemies of the state and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act and do crazy and dangerous things. And that’s what we’ve seen in increasing frequency,” Johnson said.
On ‘Meet the Press,’ Cox assigned some blame to social media, saying it has “played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years.”
Trump has credited Kirk with driving young voters to conservatism. His Turning Point movement says it has more than 800 chapters across college campuses. Kirk’s widow on Friday said the movement’s efforts would go forward.
A memorial event for Kirk will be held on September 21 in Glendale, Arizona, his organisation said.</p><small>2025-09-14 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14222042515fbb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941961/rain-has-final-say-as-england-and-south-africa-share-t20-series' target='_blank'><strong>Rain has final say as England and South Africa share T20 series</strong></a><br><p>The third and final Twenty20 International between England and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled at Trent Bridge on Sunday as rain had the final say in the series that finishes 1-1.

Israel targeted Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Attending a ministerial meeting in the Qatari capital, Dar delivered a speech where he highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).

“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
“This reckless and provocative attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar, contrary to the fundamental principles of international law, including the UN Charter, in particular its Article 2(4) prohibiting the threat or use of force.”
Calling the attack “unwarranted, unjustified and appalling”, the foreign minister highlighted that this activity is emblematic of Israel’s rogue mindset, which disregards international law and norms.
“No state is safe from such an unhinged entity that defies all precepts of civilised behaviour, Dar stated. “The question of Israeli accountability is a test for the credibility of the global system.”
The foreign minister highlighted urgent steps that need to be taken “to safeguard the global order”:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the Ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.


 






Monday’s summit in Doha is expected to rally support for Qatar in the wake of last week’s Israeli attack targeting Hamas in the Gulf state.
A draft of the resolution that will be considered by heads of state condemned Israel’s attack as a destabilising escalation and said the states opposed Israel’s “plans to impose a new reality in the region”.
The draft, which was seen by Reuters, did not mention any diplomatic or economic moves against Israel. The resolution may change before the leaders meet in Doha on Monday.
The attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
The emergency summit, bringing together members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), began with a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution.
 






The gathering is a message that “Qatar is not alone … and that Arab and Islamic states stand by it,” Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
Dar will “lead Pakistan’s delegation to the ministerial meeting ahead of the Emergency Arab-Islamic Summit”, a statement by the FO said.
Upon arrival, the deputy PM was received by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer, Pakistan’s envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and senior officials of the Qatari government.
 






The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member OIC — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level moot.
“The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians,“ an FO statement said yesterday.
 
 

Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
On the sidelines of the preparatory foreign ministers’ meeting, Dar today met with Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty.
“They condemned illegal Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them blatant violations of sovereignty and international law. Both reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and stressed the urgent need for unity across the Muslim ummah,” FO said in a statement.
 






Dar aslo with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, on the sidelines of the meeting.
According to the FO, they strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them grave violations of sovereignty, international law, and the UN Charter.
“Both (leaders) underscored the pivotal role of the Arab League and the OIC in uniting the Muslim Ummah at this critical juncture and reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s just struggle for freedom and self-determination,” the FO statement read.
 






Dar further met with with Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan on the sidelines of the meeting.
“They strongly condemned Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations as gross violations of sovereignty and international law,” the FO said.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and emphasized the vital importance of unity across the Muslim Ummah. They welcomed the Arab Islamic Summit as timely and essential for collective action at this critical juncture.”
 






‘Matter of grave concern’
Analysts say tomorrow’s Arab-Islamic summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Pakistan has been vocal in its criticism of Israel, especially taking the centre stage at a recent United Nations Security Council meeting, where it engaged in a heated debate with Israel.
“Repeated Israeli attacks against sovereign states in the region are a matter of grave concern, not only for the Muslim ummah but also for the wider international community,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters on Friday.
Following the attack, PM Shehbaz undertook a one-day visit to Doha, where he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli action and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
 
 

Qatar plays a mediation role in Israel’s recent war on Gaza alongside the US and Egypt. It hosts the largest US base in the region, and also recently gave US President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 UNSC members in condemning the Israeli strike during Thursday’s emergency meeting. The US has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
Despite ongoing tensions, Trump on Friday held a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York.
The US president has said he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli attack on Qatar. However, earlier today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.</p><small>2025-09-14 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/142030390f5c56a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941952/karachi-police-warn-citizens-against-aerial-firing-amid-pak-india-asia-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police warn citizens against aerial firing amid Pak-India Asia Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>As excitement builds for Sunday’s highly anticipated Pakistan-India Asia Cup cricket match, law enforcement authorities in Karachi have issued a strong warning against celebratory aerial firing, citing concerns over public safety and law and order.
Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho has directed all senior police officers across the city to implement strict measures to prevent such incidents. In a statement released by his office today, the AIG emphasised that aerial firing will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“Those found involved in this illegal act will be arrested immediately, face legal proceedings, and be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” the police official added.
The Karachi police have appealed to citizens to celebrate responsibly and avoid any form of celebratory gunfire. Authorities warned that aerial firing is not only a criminal offence under the law but can also lead to tragic loss of life and injury.
Citizens have been urged to report any instances of aerial firing by immediately calling the police helpline at 15.
“The cooperation of the public is essential to maintaining peace and order in the city,” said a police spokesperson.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.</p><small>2025-09-14 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14181807b1d0f87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941945/pakistan-china-will-continue-to-expand-collaboration-in-defence-production-aviation-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China will continue to expand collaboration in defence production, aviation: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari reaffirmed on Sunday that Pakistan and China would  continue to expand collaboration in defence production and aviation, further deepening their all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, according to a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat.
Zardari, who is on a 10-day trip to China, asserted this during a visit to the  the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — the country’s aerospace and defence conglomerate engaged in the design and production of a wide range of military and civilian aircraft,  including J-10C fighter jets that Pakistan employed during an escalation with India in May.
The use of these aircraft is said to have played a crucial role in shooting down India’s fighter jets, including Rafales, during the four-day escalation that ended with a ceasefire on May 10.
The statement by the President’s Secretariat today said: “On the 128th day since the ceasefire with India, President Asif Ali Zardari, constitutionally the supreme commander of the armed forces of Pakistan, visited the Aviation Industry Corporation of China”.

According to the statement, the president toured the sprawling complex in its entirety and met the AVIC’s engineers and scientists, “listening to their insights on innovation, production and future technologies”.
He was briefed on the AVIC’s “advanced capabilities, including the J-10 fighter jet, the co-production of the JF-17 Thunder with Pakistan, as well as progress in the J-20 stealth 5th-generation fighter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, fully automated units, and integrated command-and-control systems for modern multi-domain operations”.
The statement quoted the president as saying that “J-10 and JF-17 have greatly strengthened the Pakistan Air Force, a fact clearly demonstrated during May 2025’s Maraka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.

He hailed the AVIC as “a symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and China”.
The statement said Zardari’s visit to the facility was also historic as “no foreign head of state had previously visited the AVIC complex”.
Zardari was accompanied by his son PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his daughter MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who will be travelling with the president throughout the visit, it added.

The president later arrived in Shanghai. On his arrival at the airport, the president was warmly received by Chen Qun, vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Committee, and Ma Yinghui, director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of Shanghai Municipality, according to another statement.
President Zardari reached China on Friday, where he will hold meetings with the Chinese leadership and senior officials to further strengthen Pakistan-China relations, enhance cooperation in diverse fields, and advance shared objectives.
He will also visit Shanghai and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and hold meetings with the leadership there, according to an earlier statement by the Foreign Office.
The discussions will encompass Pakistan-China bilateral relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and future connectivity initiatives, the statement said, adding that the visit underscores the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their relations.</p><small>2025-09-14 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141514126e4a113.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941924/calls-for-boycott-in-india-ahead-of-asia-cup-match-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Calls for boycott in India ahead of Asia Cup match with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Some Indian politicians and former cricketers have called on their country to boycott its matches with Pakistan in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament, as the two arch-rival teams are set to face each other in Dubai today.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster. Still, emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who fought a four-day military conflict in May. The countries have been at odds in various matters since then, including claims of downing jets, ceasefire requests, geopolitical narratives and of course, cricket.
Several former Indian players and politicians have urged the BCCI to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy, saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, head of the Shiv Sena-UBT party, has announced that his party will organise protests across the state against the game, Hindustan Times reported.
“Our prime minister said blood and water cannot flow together, so how can blood and cricket flow together? How can war and cricket be at the same time? They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match,” he was quoted as saying.
 






Later, Indian news agency ANI shared on X a video, with a caption saying, “Shiv Sena (UBT) burns Pakistani national flag in front of Thiruvananthapuram AG’s office in protest against India vs Pakistan match today in Asia Cup.”
Ahead of today’s game, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal posted on X: “Playing a match with Pakistan is treason against the country. Every Indian is extremely angry about this.”
He was commenting on a post by AAP’s Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, who wrote: “Blood and sports cannot go together.”
 


ANI also talked to a Congress leader, Ajay Rai, on that matter, who urged the Supreme Court of India to stop the country’s team from playing against Pakistan in accordance with “public sentiment”.
A day ago, the AAP protested against the match between Men in Blue and Green Shirts, with Bharadwaj and party workers burning an effigy symbolising Pakistani players, The Hindu reported.
Former cricketer Kedhar Jadhav, also a part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the India-Pakistan fixture should not go ahead.
“I don’t know what will happen, but I have already said that according to me, this match should not be played,” Jadhav was quoted as saying by The Times of India.
The matter had also reached the Indian top court as four law students filed a petition against the match, contending that it was “against national interest”. But the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the plea.
Indian news anchor Shiv Aroor said Asia Cup was “precisely the opportunity the [Government of India] should have taken to signal that Pahalgam & [Operation] Sindoor = new rules on terror”, referring to New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which Pakistan strongly denied.
“‘Multilateral tournament’ excuses are pathetic, embarrassing. We make the rules,” Aroor said on X.
 


Meanwhile, a video clip of Indian anchorperson Arnab Goswami has been doing rounds on social media where he is calling for the match’s boycott and and saying that this match should garner the lowest television rankings. He went on to question the Indian cricket board and Sony TV, which has the broadcasting rights for the Asia Cup, that who gave “permission for the match”.
Ex-cricketer and politician Manoj Tiwary told ANI he was boycotting the match, as well as the entire Asia Cup. “It needs to be understood that this is just a sport; this is not life. We are comparing human lives to sports; this should never be done.”
He also questioned the BCCI’s “justification” for playing the matches, adding that the team could have forfeited today’s face-off and reached the finals by winning other games.
 






‘A compulsion’
On the other hand, BJP lawmaker and former sports minister Anurag Thakur defended the BCCI’s stance on playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
“When multinational tournaments are organised by ACC or ICC, it becomes a compulsion, a necessity for nations to participate,” he told ANI.
“If they don’t do that, they will be eliminated from the tournament, they will have to forfeit the match, and the other team will get the points,” he added, before pointing out that India does not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan.
 






Actor Suniel Shetty, father-in-law of cricketer KL Rahul, echoed similar sentiments: “It’s a world sporting body. They have to abide by those rules and regulations because there are a lot of other sports and a lot of athletes who are involved in them.
“As Indians, I think that is our personal call that we have to take, whether we want to see it, whether we don’t want to see it […] and that’s a call India has to take, but you cannot blame cricketers for playing because they are sportsmen, they are expected to represent the country,” he told reporters.
 






On this side of the border, former captain Wasim Akram has urged Pakistani and Indian cricketers to ignore the noise and “enjoy” the game. “Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he told AFP.
BCCI defends stance, citing future hosting risks
However, Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia defended his country’s decision to play against Pakistan. He told Hindustan Times that it was an international tournament and that a boycott would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.
“Had it been a bilateral tournament, we could have always said that we would not play against any hostile country. And so far as Pakistan is concerned, we are not playing any bilateral tournament since 2012-13 onwards,” he added.
 
 

India’s fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the team has been instructed to strictly follow the directives of the BCCI and the Indian government. He added that head coach Gautam Gambhir, who in May had also called for a boycott, has called for focus on cricket.
“Our thing is, you separate sports and politics,” he said. “I understand the sentiment, but we are following the directives of BCCI and the government. We are going by what the government and BCCI told us.
“The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time, and we didn’t think we’d be coming at one stage, but obviously the Indian government stance in it and now you have to put the sentiment and emotions behind … it’s something we addressed in the team meeting today,“ ten Doeschate added.
Still, Hindustan Times, citing a report in Dainik Jagran, said “most” BCCI officials have decided to distance themselves from the upcoming India-Pakistan match. The report claimed that a BCCI official would only be seen on-camera if India won.
Today’s clash could be the first of three as both India and Pakistan are favourites to qualify for the Super Four stage and possibly for the September 28 final.
In May, the BCCI had denied reports of withdrawal from all Asian Cricket Council (ACC) events amid recent tensions with Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-14 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14181232b2a1976.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941947/chinese-officials-hold-talks-in-spain-on-trade-irritants-tiktok-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese officials hold talks in Spain on trade irritants, TikTok deadline</strong></a><br><p>United States and Chinese officials began talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, a looming divestiture deadline for Chinese short video app TikTok and Washington’s demands that its allies place tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer arrived shortly before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, at the baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz, which houses Spain’s foreign ministry in the Spanish capital.
The talks mark the fourth time in four months that the delegations have met in European cities to try to keep a fractured US-China trade relationship from collapsing under US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The delegations last met in Stockholm in July, where they agreed in principle to extend for 90 days a trade truce that sharply reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restarted the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the United States.
Trump has approved the extension of current US tariff rates on Chinese goods, totalling about 55 per cent, until November 10.
Trade experts said there was little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough in the talks hosted by Spain, which has sought to improve ties with Beijing in recent years.
The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its US operations by September 17 or face a US shutdown.
A source familiar with the Trump administration’s discussions on TikTok’s future said that a deal was not expected, but that the deadline would be extended for a fourth time since Trump took office in January. Trump last month launched a TikTok account.
TikTok has not been discussed in previous rounds of US-China trade talks in Geneva, London and Stockholm.
But the source said the issue’s public inclusion as an agenda item on the Treasury’s announcement of the talks gives the Trump administration political cover for another extension, which may annoy both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who mandated TikTok’s sale to a US entity to reduce national security risks.

Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she expected more substantial “deliverables” to be saved for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, perhaps at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October.
These may include a final deal to resolve US national security concerns over TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, and the Madrid discussions may help lay groundwork for such a meeting, Cutler said.
But she said resolving core US economic complaints about China, including its demands that China shift its economic model toward more domestic consumption and rely less on state-subsidised exports, could take years.
“Frankly, I don’t think China is in any rush to do an agreement where they don’t get substantial concessions on export controls and lower tariffs, which are their key priorities,” Cutler said. “And I don’t see the United States in a position to make major concessions on either, unless there’s some breakthrough on its demands to China.”
Russian oil pressure
The treasury has said the Madrid talks also would cover joint US-Chinese efforts to combat money laundering, a reference to its longstanding demands that China clamp down on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine.
Bessent urged Group of Seven (G7) allies on Friday to impose “meaningful tariffs” on imports from China and India to pressure them to stop buying Russian oil, a move aimed at bringing Moscow into Ukraine peace negotiations by curbing its oil revenues.

The G7 finance ministers said on Friday they discussed such measures and agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s defence. Bessent and Greer said in a separate statement that G7 allies should join the United States in imposing tariffs on buyers of Russian oil.
“Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,” Bessent and Greer said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The US has imposed an extra 25pc tariff on Indian goods over the country’s purchases of Russian oil, but has so far refrained from imposing such punitive duties on Chinese goods.
China’s Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid talks will cover economic and trade issues such as US tariffs, the “abuse” of export controls and TikTok.
Spain’s moment
Spanish Foreign Minister Jos Manuel Albares publicly greeted the two delegations before the start of talks.
A Spanish government source said the choice of Spain for the latest round of the “delicate” talks was evidence that Madrid was consolidating itself as a seat of high-level and strategic negotiations. Madrid has sought to be a venue for an international peace conference to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The source said Spain’s government also takes advantage of the event to reinforce its own bilateral relations with the US following a series of tense engagements with the Trump administration.
Spain has criticised Israel’s offensive in Gaza and refused to commit to spending 5pc of its budget on defence, along with other Nato members.
Bessent himself has also criticised Spain for declaring Beijing a “strategic partner” at the height of Trump’s tariff offensive in April, saying that a closer relationship with the Asian giant was akin to “cutting your own throat”</p><small>2025-09-14 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14173545c15f523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941943/former-world-boxing-champion-ricky-hatton-dies-at-age-46' target='_blank'><strong>Former world boxing champion Ricky Hatton dies at age 46</strong></a><br><p>British boxer Ricky Hatton has died at the age of 46, the BBC reported on Sunday.
Former world champion Hatton won titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, before retiring in 2012. He had been due to make a comeback for an event in Dubai later this year.
Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that a body had been found on Sunday morning at an address in Hyde in the northern English city.
A police spokesman said: “Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am (0545 GMT) today (Sunday) where they found the body of a 46-year-old man. There are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances.”
Hatton had 45 wins in 48 bouts over his career but in the years after he retired he said he had tried to kill himself several times and had been open about his struggle with depression, drink and drugs.
“I was coming off the rails with my drinking and that led to drugs. It was like a runaway train,” he told BBC radio in 2016.
Hatton’s best performance came in 2005 when he stopped Australian Kostya Tszyu to add the IBF light-welterweight title to the WBU belt he already held.
He had a perfect 43-0 record until he was floored by Floyd Mayweather Jr in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same again.
Britain’s former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury paid tribute to Hatton.
“Rip to the legend Ricky Hatton may he rip,” Fury posted on Instagram.
“There will only ever be 1 Ricky Hatton. Can’t believe this so young.”
Another former world champion, Britain’s Amir Khan, described Hatton on X as a “mentor, warrior and one of Britain’s greatest boxers”.
 






Khan added: “As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong – we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up. But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind.
“Mental health isn’t weakness. It’s part of being human. And we must talk about it. We must reach out. We must lean on each other.

“Deputy Prime Minister/ Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar received a call tonight from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.
“The two leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of Pakistan-US ties and discussed recent regional and international developments. They reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations across multifaceted areas of cooperation,” the FO said.
 






The phone call between Dar and Rubio has taken place against the backdrop of improving Pakistan-US ties and amid significant developments in the Middle East.
Last month, it was noted in an analysis published by Dawn that the “positive signals” between Islamabad and Washington, “which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie”.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counter-terrorism cooperation in the arrest of an militant organisation IS-Khorasan’s operative to claiming credit for a ceasefire between Pakistan and India following their May conflict, Pakistan has perhaps featured more in incumbent US President Donald Trump’s “day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’”, it was observed in the analysis.
After the May escalation, Pakistan’s army chief also met President Trump at the White House. This was followed by a series of cabinet-level engagements, culminating in a breakthrough tariff agreement that set a uniform duty of 19 per cent on Pakistani exports to the US.
“After securing what seems to be a major discount in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor interest in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned,” the analysis said.
Earlier this month, Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding worth $500 million with an American metals company, the US Strategic Metals.
Saturday’s phone call between Dar and Rubio also took place before the latter left for a visit to Israel and the former to Qatar.
Recently, there has been a rift between Israel and Qatar, both of whom are US allies, following Tel Aviv’s strikes targeting the leaders of Palestinian group Hamas in Doha.
Israel’s action has drawn widespread international condemnation, and Dar reached Doha today to attend a ministerial meeting ahead of an emergency summit of Arab and Muslim leaders on the attack in Qatar’s capital.</p><small>2025-09-14 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14163343b0c4f26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941939/commerce-minister-reaches-iran-on-three-day-visit-to-boost-economic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Commerce minister reaches Iran on three-day visit to boost economic ties</strong></a><br><p>Federal Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan reached Tehran on Sunday for a three-day official visit to boost economic relations between Pakistan and Iran, according to a press release from the commerce ministry.
Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade.
According to the press release, Khan is expected to lead the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission and Business Forum during his visit.
“He was received at Imam Khomeini International Airport by Mr Amin Tarfa’a, adviser to Iran’s Ministry of Roads and Urban Development,” the press release read.
“During the visit, [Khan] will lead the 22nd Session of the Pakistan–Iran Joint Economic Commission and co-chair the Pakistan–Iran Joint Business Forum. He is also scheduled to hold meetings with key Iranian ministers and senior officials to strengthen bilateral trade and investment cooperation.”
Khan’s visit aims to give fresh momentum to economic and commercial ties between the two nations through the Joint Economic Commission and the Business Forum, the commerce ministry stated.
In August, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited Pakistan, where 12 agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed.
During the bilateral meeting both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.
“The agreements and MoUs included cooperation for plant protection and plant quarantine, joint use of Mirjaveh-Taftan border gate, collaboration in science, technology and innovation, cooperation in information and communications technology,” Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141540198a93e72.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941933/veteran-sports-journalist-syed-muhammad-sufi-passes-away-at-80-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Veteran sports journalist Syed Muhammad Sufi passes away at 80 in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Veteran sports journalist Syed Muhammad Sufi has passed away in Karachi on Sunday. He was 80 and died after a prolonged illness.
Sufi is survived by his wife and four sons.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), among others, expressed grief and sorrow over Sufi’s death in a condolence message.
“The PCB management, along with its staff, extends heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved family and prays that the Almighty grants the departed soul eternal peace and gives strength to the family and loved ones to bear this irreparable loss.”
Separately, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi also paid a tribute to the late journalist,
describing his passing as the end of a golden era in sports journalism.
Naqvi lauded Sufi’s lifelong dedication to promoting sports, particularly cricket, and said that his journalistic legacy would be cherished and remembered.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also expressed grief over Sufi’s death in a statement.
Former cricketer Shahid Afridi also condoled his death, remembering him as a “man of fine personality”.
He posted on X that Sufi had always been vocal for the betterment and promotion of the game and the betterment of players.
“Personally, he was always very supportive of me. His death marks the end of a great chapter in sports journalism in Pakistan,” he added, praying for the veteran journalist.
 






Similarly, sports journalist Faizan Lakhani also dubbed Sufi’s death an “end of an era”.
“Syed Muhammad Sufi, Geo’s Sports Editor and a towering figure in sports journalism, has passed away. For 60 years, he served the profession with dedication, guiding and mentoring generations of journalists. A huge loss. May Allah bless his soul,” he posted on X.
 






According to Geo News, where Sufi was a sports editor, the veteran journalist  had worked with several media outlets. These included Geo News and Daily Jang, with which he had been associated for more than 30 years, according to the news website.

Sushila Karki, the 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protesters’ demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months.
Protests, sparked by a ban on social media and feeding into long-standing economic woes, began on Monday and quickly escalated, with parliament and key government buildings set ablaze.
 
 

“We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” Karki said in her first public comments since taking office on Friday.
A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita standing at just $1,447, in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.
“What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she added.
‘From the streets’
Karki held a minute’s silence on Sunday for those killed in the unrest, before meetings began in the key government complex of Singha Durbar — where several buildings were set on fire during mass protests on Tuesday.
At least 72 people were killed in two days of protests and 191 were injured, the government’s chief secretary Eaknarayan Aryal said Sunday, increasing an earlier toll of 51. It was the worst unrest since the end of a decade-long civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.

The appointment of Karki, known for her independence, came after intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Ram Chandra Paudel, including with representatives of “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the Discord app to name Karki as their choice of leader.
“The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” Karki said.
Parliament has been dissolved and elections set for March 5, 2026.
“We will not stay here more than six months in any situation; we will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers,” she added, in a speech to the nation.
Ordinary Nepalis said they were hopeful the government would bring change, but were aware the challenges were heavy.
“This government’s list of responsibilities and issues to address isn’t easy,” said grocery shopkeeper Satya Narayan, 69, in Pharping village, about an hour outside the capital.
“It also needs to ensure unity and harmony in the country by taking all sections along”.
‘Challenging times’
President Paudel, who swore Karki into office, said late Saturday that “a peaceful solution has been found through a difficult process”.
Soldiers have scaled back their presence on the streets, where they had been deployed in large numbers after the protests. But more than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails during the chaos are on the run, and present a daunting security headache.

Regional leaders have congratulated Karki, including Nepal’s two giant neighbours, India and China.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi supported “peace, progress and prosperity” in Hindu-majority Nepal, while Beijing’s foreign ministry said it wanted to “push China-Nepal relations steadily forward”.
Buddhism is the country’s second-largest religion, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, wished Karki “every success in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people of Nepal in these challenging times“.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14161612b6d3428.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941935/uk-police-charge-man-with-criminal-damage-to-jewish-worship-places' target='_blank'><strong>UK police charge man with criminal damage to Jewish worship places</strong></a><br><p>British police charged a 37-year-old man with religiously-motivated criminal damage after several attacks on synagogues and Jewish premises in north-west London.
Seven Jewish premises have been targeted in separate incidents over the last ten days, police said, including four synagogues being smeared with a substance, while a liquid was thrown towards a school and over a car.
The substance and the liquid were bodily fluids, Sky News reported. Police called the acts “revolting and appalling”.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in Gaza in retaliation for the kidnappings of 251 Israeli citizens by Hamas.
According to a February statement from the Community Security Trust (CST) charity, which advises Britain’s estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, “more than 3,500 antisemitic incidents” were recorded in the country since Tel Aviv launched its onslaught on Gaza.
Police said they charged Ionut-Cristian Bold of no fixed address with six counts of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, three counts of damaging property, plus other offences, and he is due to appear at Willesden Magistrates Court on Monday, where he will enter his plea.

“The HRCP strongly condemns the reported decision by community elders in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form a committee aimed at expelling transgender persons from the district. Such actions are unconstitutional, discriminatory and amount to incitement to violence against an already marginalised community,” the HRCP said in a statement on X.
It added that “no citizen can be deprived of the right to reside, work or earn a livelihood anywhere in Pakistan on the basis of gender identity”.
The human rights body called on the provincial and district authorities to “immediately ensure the safety and dignity of transgender persons in Swabi and uphold their fundamental rights under the Constitution and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018”.
The committee of elders in question comprises the tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani and others.
From the committee, Maulana Samad has said that they want transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihoods elsewhere “because as long as they live here, music shows will [continue to] be arranged, negatively impacting the youth”.
Similarly, another committee member, Yasir Khan, has said that in the first phase, transgender persons would be asked to peacefully leave the district, and if that doesn’t happen, district police would be approached.
Committee members have also said that they would likely meet in the next few days and separately would also hold a meeting with the district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgender persons from the district.
The development came after police arrested more than 200 individuals, including two transgender persons, in Swabi for allegedly resisting a raid and participating in a music programme. The participants of the event have also been accused of using “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
Responding to the 11-member committee’s demand for transgender persons’ expulsion, some individuals from the transgender community released a video asserting that the expulsion would never happen.
Saying that they respected and followed local norms and values while earning a living, they stressed that the committee members should not take the law into their hands.
The transgender persons said they were “aware of the law and the Constitution, and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing at functions.”
They added that they should be viewed keeping humanity in mind.</p><small>2025-09-14 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/141238064740da5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941917/supporters-of-slain-us-influencer-charlie-kirk-shut-down-critics' target='_blank'><strong>Supporters of slain US influencer Charlie Kirk shut down critics</strong></a><br><p>For some Americans on the far right, Charlie Kirk died a “martyr”, and any criticism of the hugely popular conservative activist must be punished.
Online vitriol and grassroots persecution have exploded in the wake of the assassination of the 31-year-old who had been an electrifying presence on the US right, with the killing further deepening fraught political divisions in the country.
Laura Sosh-Lightsy, assistant dean of students at a university in the southern state of Tennessee, found herself in hot water after posting on social media about Kirk’s death.
“Hate begets hate. ZERO sympathy,” she said on Facebook after the killing, which happened Wednesday in front of a large crowd at a university in Utah.
Republican US Senator Marsha Blackburn quickly called out the comment — and Sosh-Lightsy.
“This person should be ashamed of her post. She should be removed from her position,” the Tennessee lawmaker said.
Middle Tennessee State University’s president announced that same night an employee’s firing for a “callous” comment about Kirk.
Kirk, who rallied his millions of followers to help President Donald Trump win a second White House term, was both revered and reviled for his pro-gun, anti-abortion and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
Shooting suspect Tyler Robinson, who was arrested Thursday, is said to have engraved anti-fascist messages on his bullet casings. This has led to a large part of the American right labelling him a “far-left” killer.
 
 

Some Kirk supporters have turned into online sleuths, searching out accounts that praised or celebrated Kirk’s murder.
“If they have their picture on their profile, even without a name, download the picture and reverse image search it,” conservative influencer Joey Mannarino said.
“Cross-reference it with their LinkedIn profile and find their place of employment. Call the place of employment, leave Google reviews.”
These efforts have targeted teachers, firefighters and even military personnel, some of whom have lost their jobs.
Kirk’s murder has been condemned by both sides of the political aisle. But Trump quickly blamed the country’s “radical left,” even as authorities were only just launching a manhunt for the killer.
Online trackers have targeted an Oklahoma teacher, who posted on social media: “Charlie Kirk died the same way he lived: bringing out the worst in people.”
That teacher has since been investigated by the state’s Department of Education, which described his comments as “abhorrent.”
Stadium memorial service
Trump, who praised Kirk as a “giant of his generation,” has led the US government in memorialising the activist, with high-ranking US officials working to weed out critics of Kirk and his legacy.
Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff in honour of his ally, and Kirk’s body was flown from Utah to his home in Phoenix, Arizona, aboard Air Force Two, escorted by Vice President JD Vance.
 






Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered members of the military to identify colleagues who mocked or celebrated Kirk’s death.
US Under Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” he said in a post on X.
“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so the @statedept can protect the American people.”
 






Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has Trump’s ear, has been one of the most high-profile attackers of Kirk’s critics.
She denounced an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who had expressed disgust on Instagram that flags would be lowered for “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.”
Loomer shared the staffer’s LinkedIn profile and said: “These people hate us. They don’t belong near the levers of our National Power.”
Following Loomer’s post, FEMA said the employee was placed on leave for making “revolting and unconscionable” comments.
On Saturday, Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, announced that a memorial service for its founder will be held on September 21 in a suburb of Phoenix.
The chosen venue hints at the expected turnout: a stadium normally home to a professional football team, with a seating capacity of more than 63,000.</p><small>2025-09-14 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1410363915e8249.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941758/elders-form-body-to-expel-transgenders-from-swabi' target='_blank'><strong>Elders form body to ‘expel’ transgenders from Swabi</strong></a><br><p>SWABI: Elders formed an 11-member committee here on Saturday, declaring all transgender persons will be expelled from Swabi district.
The development came after a Wednesday incident when the transgender people and participants of a music programme used “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
The police later launched a crackdown, leading to the arrest of 226 people, including two transgender persons.
 
 

The 11-member committee comprises tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani, religious leader Maulana Abdul Hadi, Gul Nabi Khan, president of Islahi Jirga Maneri Payyan, Bakhtiar Khan, general secretary, Bashir Khan, president, Islahi Jirga Maneri Bala, Gul Rehman, general secretary, Yasir Khan, president of Anjuman-i-Dokandaran, Swabi city, Irsalan Khan, senior vice-president, Zamin Shah Bhutto president of traders Link Road Swabi and two transgender.
Maulana Haqqani said: “We don’t want our youth to get involved in wrong activities and wish to create an environment where everyone earn livelihood with dignity and honour.”
Maulana Samad said the committee wanted transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihood elsewhere because as long as they lived here, music shows would be arranged, negatively impacting youth.
Yasir Khan said that in the first phase, transgender persons would ask peacefully to leave the district and if that act didn’t work, then the district police would be involved for the purpose.
 
 

“We are determined to achieve our target,” he said.
Meanwhile, the transgender persons said in a video message that they respected elders and treated everyone with respect and did not speak against anyone but the circumstances forced them to raise their voice.
They said the explusion would never happen.
They warned elders against taking the law into their own hands and said they respected and followed local norms and values while earning livelihood.
They complained that the people blamed them for their children’s act of watching their performances.
The transgender persons said they were aware of the law and the Constitution and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing in functions.
They said that none of transgenders was involved in the sale of ice-drug or liquor but various illegal activities continued in the district, needing attention.
They said elders should look at them from the perspective of humanity as they’re part of the Pakhtun society. Meanwhile, members of the committee said that they were expected to meet in the next few days and would also hold a meeting with district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgenders from the district.

He knew exactly what to say.
“There’s no such message to the players,” he responded when asked at the Asia Cup captains’ press conference if he had instructed his men to keep their cool against India on Sunday — their first meeting since the brief armed conflict between the two countries in May.
“My players are more than welcome to show aggression whenever they want,” Salman went on. “As far as it remains within the field.”
It was a breath of fresh air for Pakistan cricket fans — both casuals and diehards. Honesty, assertiveness and an unapologetic tone have defined Salman’s early days as Pakistan’s Twenty20 International captain. His arrival has coincided with Mike Hesson’s appointment as white-ball head coach, and together they’ve tried to instil a structure long missing from Pakistan cricket.
“Salman’s appointment as Pakistan’s captain has raised expectations,” Ali Zaki, a 22-year-old fan, told Dawn on Saturday. “Although our team is inexperienced, the intent from the players is evident. Before this, I had no expectations from the team.”
 



The new vibe is fearless, loud, and unapologetic

As many as 15 matches into their partnership, Salman and Hesson may not have perfected their messaging, but both have been clear and consistent. Hesson has taken bold decisions — most notably moving on from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan — and backed younger talent while stressing squad culture over individual reliance.
 
 

Salman, meanwhile, has spoken with refreshing honesty. “You can’t make the Pakistan team without merit,” he reminded during a podcast recently. “You have to clear tough hurdles and perform consistently at every level.”
The contrast with the timid, hesitant era that preceded them is stark. Pakistan’s last year T20 World Cup campaign ended in a first-round exit, complete with an embarrassing loss to the USA, and exposed the costs of mediocrity. Even during brief spells of stability, there was reluctance to change and an unwillingness to match the approach of top sides.
Now, the signs suggest something different. Emerging names like Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan and Hasan Nawaz are encouraged to take on games without fear.
For Salman, the shift is about resetting Pakistan’s cricketing identity.
“We can’t afford to play with fear anymore,” he said in the same podcast. “Our job is to take the game on, no matter who the opposition is.”
 
 

That confidence is trickling into how Pakistan carries itself. Media interactions have grown sharper, less about protecting reputations and more about clarity. The stump mics too, have captured Salman’s slip-field chatter — quips, sledges and the occasional harmless expletive — giving fans a glimpse of a dressing room no longer shy of character.
For once, Pakistan’s “aura”, as the Gen Z fans put it, feels like it belongs to the present, not the past.

Entire settlements of Ramzan Mallah, Usman Khaskheli, Urs Mallah, Allah Dino Mallah, Haroon Mallah, Ghulam Mallah, Haji Shahdad Khaskheli, Haroon Khaskheli, and Suleman Mallah have been encircled by water, cutting off their road access to nearby towns. The villagers are now using boats to receive food and other essentials.
As the lake swells with Indus waters, reverse flow has begun, inundating vast tracts of the riverine belt. The Ghar Marhu canal, which irrigated hundreds of thousands of acres through Udero Lal Barrage on the river, was blocked near the GBU dyke last week in a desperate attempt to preempt damage from the rising floodwaters.
But preparedness on ground remained questionable. Near Isa Khaskheli village, the irrigation department has set up only a makeshift hut manned by a few junior staffers.
 
 

A bulldozer stationed on-site stands idle for lack of fuel. During a visit by journalists, the dyke was found abandoned, with no senior irrigation officials in sight.
“The bulldozer has just been parked here for show. It has no diesel,” said the machine’s operator, adding that repeated appeals for fuel had been ignored by the officers concerned.
For villagers in Isa Khaskheli, Basar Khaskheli, Ali Muhammad Khaskheli, and Gheel Mori town, anxiety grows by the day. With their homes under water and escape routes severed, they fear the dyke could collapse in the absence of urgent intervention.
 
 

Local communities demanded immediate action against negligent irrigation officials and deployment of trained staff and resources at the Baghar Ochto dyke to prevent what they warned could become a humanitarian disaster.
Irrigation officials busy strengthening dykes
In Larkana, the officials had foc­us­ed on taking maximum possible measures to ensure the deluge safely passed under Sukkur Barrage and flowed down to the sea with minimum and no damage.
Presently, Moria Loop Bund, New/Old Abad Loop Bund and Hakra Loop Bund managed by Northern Dadu division were declared highly sensitive where irrigation officials were vigilant and busy strengthening the existing structures.
Reports from Naudero on Saturday suggested that the Indus was continuously rising at Burira Ferry point forcing villagers in riverine area to shift to the dykes. As soon as water receded they would return to their dwellings.
A number of few families, who had taken shelter on Larkana-Sehwan dyke near Dodo Sanhari village, complained to this reporter about lack of assistance from the district government.
At Larkana-Khairpur bridge alongside the ‘Palija bund’, floodwater was coming close to the dyke while the irrigation department had temporarily built huts manned with staff to keep an eye on the situation.
A large number of dumpers and trucks loaded with stones were being unloaded at Moria Loop dyke where the river was striking with full force and mounting pressure.
MPA Mir Nadir Magsi had on Friday said the New/Old Abad dyke was highly sensitive. Northern Dadu Division’s superintendent engineer Jamil Sangi, assistant engineer Riaz Abbasi and sub-engineer Nadeem Jaffery told journalists at the dyke on Saturday that work was going on to strengthen the dyke.
This dyke was located four kilometers upstream near the structure of Larkana-Khairpur bridge and was part of Larkana-Sehwan dyke, said Mr Sangi.
The river at this point had created an island and shifted its main current about one mile away from the main dyke while stagnant water was also staying there. The irrigation officials said that main current could at any moment shift, as it all depended on the behaviour of the river.
Sources in the irrigation department disclosed that Japan International Coope­ration Agency (JICA) had committed to strengthen the New/Old Abad dyke. The work would only start once the required studies as per JICA’s criteria were completed, said the sources, adding that two years had passed since the commitment.
The sources said that the dyke was not in good shape and a team of experts from JICA was due to arrive on Monday to visit the site along with the irrigation officials concerned.
Almost all depressions close to the dyke were filled with floodwater but surprisingly the dwellers were still reluctant to leave their houses and move up to the dyke or to safer place.
At Hakra Loop dyke six kilometers from Mohenjo Daro irrigation staff were posted in temporarily built huts. Work on apron and stone pitching was under way from 13/0 miles to 22/2 miles where floodwater struck the dyke. Presently 16/1 mile of Hakra dyke was risky, said the irrigation staff stationed there.
There are five spurs to protect the Hakra Loop dyke however it was seen that residents of riverine area were trying to reach the dyke after wading through stagnant water inundating their land, crops and houses.

Speaking at a session on Adopting Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency in Pakistan: Possibilities and Concerns, organised by the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) on Saturday, Mr Zaidi outlined the risks and opportunities surrounding digital currencies.
He said a law enabling cryptocurrency regulation has been passed and is under discussion in parliament. However, he stressed that digital or virtual currencies, by design, are difficult to regulate.
“Cryptocurrencies flourish because they leave no trail. A currency born unregulated cannot be regulated,” he argued. While the US market has seen widespread adoption, he noted, the difference lies in the freer foreign exchange regime. In Pakistan, commercial banks cannot buy and sell dollars without the State Bank’s permission.

Says Pakistan cannot regulate virtual currencies under current system; nearly 9m Pakistanis hold digital assets

Trust and acceptance
Mr Zaidi estimated that around nine million Pakistanis hold or trade virtual currencies, primarily Bitcoin, a decentralised digital asset where transactions are recorded on a blockchain and issuance is independent of any central bank.
 
 

He added that digital currencies are already being used to settle transactions, including under-invoicing in trade with China, in ways similar to the hawala system. “This is not about being too fast or too slow in adoption. The reality is that our system cannot regulate it,” he said.
He emphasised that all currencies are built on trust, pointing to the US dollar today and the British pound in the past. Similarly, a trusted digital currency could emerge as a medium of payment worldwide.
He suggested that asset-backed cryptocurrencies could, in theory, be issued, but demand would remain weak since unregulated digital assets allow holders to convert black money into white.
Citing examples abroad, he noted that India had formally rejected cryptocurrencies, while in the US, they continue to grow in popularity.
He also linked cryptocurrencies to political debates in the US, claiming that former president Donald Trump’s administration supported them after facing resistance from the Federal Reserve. Mr Zaidi quoted a banker as saying the Trump family earned $2.4bn through virtual currencies during their time in office.
Digitisation versus crypto
While acknowledging Pakistan’s progress in digitising its financial system, Mr Zaidi underlined that crypto belongs to a different domain.
“Digitisation is about documentation and traceability. Crypto thrives on the opposite — anonymity and lack of control,” he said.
Experts at the session noted that the use of virtual currencies in Pakistan is likely to continue growing, particularly as tight foreign exchange controls limit other avenues for cross-border payments.

“During Covid-19 we expanded rapidly, launching four verticals in 18 months instead of one in two years,” he recalled. “Impulse purchases defined that period — snacks, cigarettes, small-ticket items.”
Average order sizes have since increased. Grocery baskets have risen from Rs800-900 during the pandemic to Rs2,000-2,200, while food deliveries average Rs1,200. The blended average per order now stands at Rs1,400-1,500.
“The pandemic was about habit creation. Now we’re working to shift customers from impulse buys to weekly grocery missions,” Mr Peracha said, adding that monthly shopping is still largely done offline.

Online orders move from impulse to grocery top-ups

Food delivery continues to generate about 70pc of the platform’s topline, with groceries contributing the remainder.
 
 

The company is active in 35 cities for food deliveries and 12 for groceries, with dark stores operating in seven. Product assortments are tailored by locality.
A subsidiary of Germany’s Delivery Hero, foodpanda entered Pakistan in 2016. An Economic Impact Assessment by Lahore University of Management Sciences estimates its investment at $100m over the past decade, including €2.3m in kitchen infrastructure. Tax contributions in FY24 amounted to Rs9.76bn.
The company plans to double business in three years by scaling up kitchens, expanding marts through owned and franchised outlets, and broadening its shops platform.
Employment & entrepreneurs
foodpanda’s operations rely on 50,000 registered riders, of whom 17,000-18,000 are active daily. Full-time riders earn Rs48,000-50,000 per month, though fuel and maintenance costs are borne by them. Compensation rates adjust with fuel price swings.
 
 

Female riders remain few, but Mr Peracha recounted examples such as a young woman commuting daily from Sheikhupura to Lahore on a 125cc bike.
Women, however, dominate the home-chef segment. The impact report notes over 7,000 home-based entrepreneurs on the platform, 75pc of them women, earning an average of Rs120,000 per month. About half are first-time earners.
Thin margins
Foodpanda charges an average 25pc commission, with variations depending on order volumes. Restaurants also pay sales tax once revenue crosses the legal threshold. Only 15–20pc of eateries on the platform are currently GST-registered.
Provincial governments have reduced service tax rates for home chefs — to 8pc in Sindh and 5pc in Punjab. Even so, commissions and taxes can consume around 30pc of revenue. With food costs at 30pc, about 40pc remains for other expenses and profit.
Dark kitchens, which share facilities, pay commissions plus rent or a revenue share, depending on volumes.
Coping with internet shutdowns
The company faced a sharp setback in May 2023 when mobile internet was suspended for nearly three days. Foodpanda lost 70pc of its gross merchandise value.
“It wasn’t just us — Daraz, Careem, everyone was hit,” the CEO said.
To adapt, foodpanda shared Wi-Fi passwords of partner restaurants with riders in major cities to keep deliveries going, though the absence of Google Maps made navigation difficult.

Federal Interior Minis­ter Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday instructed officials to identify suitable land for the new headquarters and sought a master plan for the facilities, according to a statement released after a meeting at the Capital Development Authority.
He emphasised that while identifying the land, the requirements for both headquarters and training facilities should be given special consideration.
The meeting was also attended by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, the federal secretary of interior, the chairman of the CDA and senior police and constabulary officials.
“The Federal Constabu­lary will be developed on modern foundations with the aim of transforming it into a well-structured and highly effective force,” Mr Naqvi said.
The move follows Presi­dent Asif Ali Zardari’s promulgation in July of the Frontier Constabulary Reorganisation Ordinance 2025, which officially renamed the force.
 
 

The ordinance extends the Federal Constabu­la­ry’s jurisdiction across the entire country, including all four provinces, Isla­m­abad, Azad Jammu and Ka­­shmir, and Gilgit-Bal­tis­tan. Under the new fra­mework, the federal government will appoint the inspector general of the Federal Constabulary.
Each division will also have a wing commander, who will hold a rank eq­­uivalent to a deputy ins­pector general. Further­­more, officers from the Police Service of Pakistan will command the force.
The force’s responsibilities will include riot control, internal security, counter-terrorism and protection services. It will also have powers under the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 and the Police Order of 2002.
The federal government will control the force and can deploy the constabulary as a reserve force to support Islamabad police, provincial police and other law enforcement agencies.
The effort to reform the force is not new. In 2018, then-interior minister Ahsan Iqbal said the federal government was considering a proposal to upgrade the Frontier Constabulary to bring the force and incentives for its personnel on par with those of other civilian law enforcement agencies.

Addit­ional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Bal­och has ordered the initiation of proclamation proceedings against Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz and his son Ali Riaz Malik in two cases pertaining to alleged money laundering of the housing giant’s funds abroad.
During Saturday’s hearing, the court adjourned further proceedings aga­inst the real estate tycoon and his son until September 30, while moving to formally declare them as absconder in the cases.
Last week, the same court distributed copies of the challan among three other accused, including retired Colonel Khalilur Rehman, personal staff officer of Malik Riaz, along with Mushtaq and Imran.
 
 

According to court proceedings, Mr Rehman received the challan in person. Mushtaq appeared physically, while Imran’s attendance was marked via video link. Both Mushtaq and Imran are expected to appear in person at the next hearing.
The FIA’s money laundering wing registered the case, alleging that the accused illegally transferred large sums abroad to finance Malik Riaz’s Dubai property project.
The court’s move comes at a time when Mr Riaz is facing mounting legal troubles.
Last month, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar revealed that investigators had found “incontrovertible proof of large-scale money laundering and corruption by Mr Riaz and his company.
He disclosed that the FIA raided Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi, which was allegedly used as a “front office” to conceal cash and records.
According to the minister, hospital ambulances were used to transport money and documents to avoid raising suspicion.
The raid unearthed evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering, while investigators expect further amounts to surface as the probe deepens. Mr Tarar also alleged that Bahria Town’s chief financial officer and finance director were linked to hawala and hundi operators engaged in sending funds abroad. He added that Bahria Town staff attempted to destroy documents during the raid, but investigators managed to seize most of the records.
The minister clarified that the government’s inquiry was focused on Mr Riaz, his family, and company officials, and not on residents of Bahria Town.

The move, announced on Friday, is part of efforts to ensure prudent use of public resources and to rationalise security arrangements in line with official entitlements.
The security regime for serving judges has also been regulated suitably, making it rational and aligned with the entitlements under the rules.
In the same spirit, security for retired judges has also been regulated in accordance with applicable rules, established security protocols and entitlements, including the relevant presidential order that provides lifetime security to retired judges, considering the sensitive nature of their past office and continuing security concerns.
In order to operationalise these security protocols, without conferring any extraordinary benefit, added concession or privilege, a circular has been issued to scale down deployment of force in excess of entitlement, reaffirming compliance with rules, and to facilitate coordination between the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior and provincial authorities for implementation.

Narowal stands second with 908 Mauzas affected, where 180,000 people were hit by floods and four deaths were reported. In Jhang, 313 Mauzas were affected, though no deaths or injuries were reported. 

PDMA report says 4,744 Mauzas across Punjab affected so far; Sialkot tops list with 1,069 villages

In Gujrat, 214 Mauzas, including urban areas, were affected by floods and four people were reported dead. Other affected districts include Gujranwala/Wazirabad (74), Mandi Bahauddin (78), Hafizabad (165), Sargodha (41), Chiniot (144), Khanewal (158), Multan (138), Muzaffar­garh (147), Sheikhupura (96), Lahore (26), Nan­kana Sahib (97), Kasur (163), Okara (141), Toba Tek Singh (80), Fai­sal­abad (41), Sahiwal (91), Pakpattan (77), Lodhran (20), Vehari (103), Bahawalnagar (143) and Bahawalpur (121).

More than 4.57 million people have been impacted by the floods in the aforementioned rivers. Overall, 101 people have died and eight have been injured. 
However, Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza clarified that the one death reported in Lahore was incorrect and had been mistakenly recorded by Rescue 1122. “I will get it corrected soon, as no casualty was reported in the entire Lahore district,” he told Dawn.
The report further claims that over 2.5 million people have been evacuated from flood-hit areas, while more than 2 million animals have been shifted to safe pla­ces. 
A total of 392 relief camps have been set up by district administrations, where 81,810 people are currently residing. In addition, 493 med­ical camps have treated 383,976 people, while 422 veterinary camps are also operational.
