Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Rival groups have since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
“Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened,” Chaudhry said on X in the early hours of Saturday.
 
 

“This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added.
The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between a high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days.
Chaudhry shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”.
 






In order to oversee and implement the agreement, a Monitoring and Implementation Committee comprising representatives from the federal government, its AJK counterpart and the JAAC will be notified, the document said.
Besides Chaudhry and Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam from the federal government, the panel will also include two nominated representatives from the AJK administration and two members of the JAAC.
The committee will be responsible for dispute resolution, will formulate rules and regulations of the working methodology and define timelines for the implementation of every decision in the “light of budgetary allocation and other constraints”.
“The committee will also review existing perks and privileges / fringe benefits authorised to [the] judiciary, government officials and ministers in order to rationalise it,” the agreement read.
Chaudhry, Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.
From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry.
Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC.
On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.

The black Range Rover Sport was stolen on Nov 11, 2022 from Harrogate, UK, and in February this year, with the help of its tracker, it was located in Karachi on Korangi Road.
Later, Interpol sent a letter to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad, the Karachi police and the Anti-Vehicles Lifting Cell (AVLC), alerting them about the stolen vehicle.
Talking to Dawn on Friday, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said that the Interpol’s letter was received two days ago at the office of AVLC SSP.
“We have sent an email to the UK police and asked them to send us a detailed log of the tracker fitted in the vehicle,” he said.

Interpol says the SUV was last tracked on Korangi Road in February

The IGP said that the police also sought the source of the active location of the vehicle from the tracker, as the vehicle was last spotted in Karachi on Feb 11, 2025.
According to the Interpol’s letter, the black Range Rover Sport was stolen from UK on November 11, 2022. The vehicle was fitted with a tracker, and it was last spotted in Leeds, where it was lost.
It said that the UK police requested cooperation from Pakistani authorities to trace and locate the vehicle.
Earlier in 2022, another luxury vehicle, Bentley Mulsanne, stolen from the UK was recovered from Karachi after a British intelligence agency tracked down the exact location of the car and informed Pakistani authorities.

• Murad says elected representatives, DCs and police will ‘forcibly’ vaccinate children whose parents refuse inoculation                 
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah is likely to take stern action against the parents who refuse polio vaccination for their children.  
The punitive measures include blocking of cell phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) and suspending national identity cards and passports to restrict access to communication and travel facilities.  
“I have no other options but to penalise those who shirk their national duty of eradicating polio, a responsibility that starts at home and affects the entire province and country,” he said while chairing a meeting here at CM House on Friday.  
Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho and Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Coordinator Irshad Sodhar briefed the CM.  
The meeting participants were informed that during the last month’s anti-polio campaign, 216,664 children missed the polio drops.  
Out of these, 181,142 children were not at home while 35,522 children’s parents refused vaccination.  
After listening to the briefing and the issue of refusal, the chief minister said that he was considering blocking mobile SIMs and suspending computerised national identity cards (CNICs) of those refusing polio drops.  
He directed Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah to submit to him a plan to block mobile SIMs, CNICs and passports of individuals refusing polio drops to their children.  
The CM directed to activation of the Refusal Conversion Committee (RCC) to address and eliminate refusal cases.  
He said elected representatives, deputy commissioners, and SSP would visit such households to administer polio drops to children “forcibly”.  
He also decided to set up a ‘Polio Vaccine Refusal Cell’ at CM House. The cell will be provided with union council-wise details of parents refusing to vaccinate their children so they can be addressed through social, political and administrative means.  
The CM expressed regret over the continued reporting of polio cases, despite intensive efforts. He directed the health department and district administration to work seriously towards eradicating polio.  
He warned that negligence in the polio campaign would not be tolerated.  
“Any official not showing performance will no longer be part of his team. I have already removed some officers from the health department and administration,” he said and added that further negligence in polio eradication would lead to the removal of responsible officers.  
“The purpose of today’s meeting is to launch the polio campaign at the Union Council level with renewed enthusiasm,” he said.  
“In the past week, two more polio cases were reported, raising the province’s total to nine, which is quite painful,” the chief minister said.  
Among the 29 polio cases reported nationwide, Sindh has nine, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 18, while Punjab and Azad Jammu & Kashmir have one each police case.  
“I do not want a routine presentation regarding polio eradication,” the chief minister said and demanded a comprehensive plan from the health department.  
The new cases reported are two each from Thatta and Badin, while Mithi, Umerkot, Hyderabad, Qambar, and Larkana have one each. Most cases occurred because parents refused to give the polio drops to their kids, or children were not at home during vaccination campaign.  
The Karachi and Malir cases are due to refusal, the chief minister was told.  
Refusing polio vaccination is absolutely unacceptable, he emphasised. He questioned how parents could refuse polio drops and cause their children to become disabled.  
“Such refusal harms not only their children, but also spreads the virus to other children,” he added. 
Samples tested positive 
Environmental samples for polio in Karachi have tested positive, the meeting was informed.  
Currently, the polio virus is present in areas including Sohrab Goth, Machar Colony, Chakro Nalo, and Rashid Minhas in East Karachi. In West Karachi, virus presence is confirmed in Khamiso Goth, Orangi, and Muhammad Khan Colony in Keamari. In Malir, Bakhtawar Goth; in Korangi, Korangi Nala; in Central Karachi, Haji Merid Goth; and in South, Hijrat Colony and Manzoor Colony show the presence of polio virus.  
Drive from 13th 
The CM said that from October 13 the polio campaign must be conducted on a war footing and the entire administration must actively participate in the drive.  
He appealed to the public to come forward so that their children and their neighbours’ children remain polio-free.  
After receiving the briefing, the chief minister said that most of the new cases in rural areas had been reported from border areas of the districts. This time, he emphasised that the polio vaccination must also cover all nomadic families.  
Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas Divisions house nomadic families migrating from one area to another, he added.  
Minister Health Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, IG Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Commissioner of Karachi Hassan Naqvi, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Secretary School Education Zahid Abbasi, Secretary Local Govt Waseem Shamshad, Senior Member Board of Revenue Khalid Hyder Shah, Secretary Health Rehan Baloch, Additional IG Karachi Javed Odho, Coordinator EOC Irashad Sodhar, Director PPHI Javed Jagirani, DG Health Dr Waqar Mahmood, all deputy commissioners of Karachi and (on video link) all divisional commissioners, DIGs and their deputy commissioners as well as DHOs were present.

The 450 activists, which included Pakistanis, in the flotilla of over 40 boats were headed to the coast of Gaza to break the 18-year-long naval blockade of the occupied Strip.
They were bringing baby formula, humanitarian supplies and medicines to Gaza’s starving people of whom many are children. In a world which has stood by as new tribulations have been visited upon the hapless Palestinians at the hands of Israeli authorities, the flotilla hoped to bring the message that the international community had not forgotten them.
One of the people, who was detained by Israeli authorities, was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, a vociferous advocate for the people of Gaza. In an interview before joining the flotilla, Greta said that her “mission should not have to exist” because it was the job of governments to follow international law and provide humanitarian aid. The flotilla mission obviously exists because governments have stood by and watched as over 65,000 civilians have been killed by Israeli forces while hundreds of thousands are being starved. Her statement brings into question the value of international law in a world where such suffering is allowed to exist.
 
 

Greta Thunberg is set to be deported. It is almost certain that she will continue her activism on behalf of the Palestinian people, forcing governments to accept accountability for their inaction.
Her work is worth recounting because it shows how the tremendous platform that comes with being an international celebrity can be used to push for transformational change in the world. A young white woman who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, Greta has no personal, ethnic or religious connection with the Palestinians. However, in empathising with their suffering she shows that humanity still exists and that a massive platform can be used to guide young people to the cause of truth and justice opening their eyes to Palestinian suffering.
Another young woman who also commands celebrity status on a mega scale is the youngest Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai.
 
 

However, unlike Greta, her engagement with Gaza has been perfunctory. Yousafzai spent last year producing an Off-Broadway show with former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who has not only failed to call what has been taking place in Gaza a genocide but has also been a supporter of Zionism.
When young American college students took to protesting against Israel’s attacks on the hapless civilian population of Gaza, Hillary Clinton suggested they were uneducated and had been fed propaganda. To put it in simple words, there is no confusion about where Hillary Clinton, who has taken millions of dollars from Zionist donors in her political career, stands on Gaza.

Greta has shown that humanity still exists.

Malala and Hillary Clinton’s Off-Broadway project Suffs focused on the women of the American suffrage movement. She told AP that she “still had no idea about the US side of the story”. But she would be aware that South Asian women were fighting British colonialism and laying down their lives against European aggression long before the US-based suffrage movement which celebrates itself as one of the first examples of women’s political activism in the world.
So just as the Israeli government was bombing hospitals in Gaza, with Hillary Clinton refraining from any condemnation of this grotesque action, Malala was eagerly collaborating with the former secretary of state on the show as a producer. Nor were there any suggestions to introduce any changes to it, for instance, the insertion of corrections that would show black and brown women’s pioneering activism against colonialism long before the US suffrage movement. In her interview, Malala noted that the show helped her view “activism from a different lens”.
 
 

The words are ironic. As a global celebrity, Malala could not be oblivious to the cataclysm that is being brought down on an innocent civilian population. Activism, indeed, is the answer, but Malala’s choice was not to opt for it. In the months since her debut as a producer, Malala has suddenly discovered the Palestinian cause — only after she facing public criticism.
In Greta and Malala are two models of how power, whether one is a small-scale influencer or an international celebrity, can be used. With all power comes scrutiny and responsibility. Greta Thunberg reminds us that there are causes bigger than oneself than the details of one’s own desires. Sadly, Malala — whose latest book about finding her way will be released next month —illustrates the opposite.

This is the culmination of the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan that started in November 2023.
Even those with proper documentation, such as Proof of Registration cards, or those born in Pakistan are not exempt. This misguided policy is wrong in every way. From a moral and religious point of view, loyalties to the notion of a nation state (a Western concept), do not eclipse our responsibilities towards fellow human beings, especially the ummah. The experience of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and his companions in Madina is a clear lesson on how refugees and settlers should be treated.
Religious teachings do not approve of expelling a population in their time of need just because global funding for their upkeep has dried up. For a country that declares Islam as the state religion, this argument should suffice as to why deportation should not be considered. For those of a more liberal persuasion, the deportations violate international law under the principle of non-refoulement covered by the Refugees Convention. While Pakistan is not a signatory to the convention, it did vote in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from where this law draws its inspiration.
 
 

Many justifiably doubt whether an argument based on ethics, morality or human rights will prevail in Pakistan. So, let’s examine the strategic side of this policy. Two key reasons are cited in favour of deportation: first, that Afghan settlers pose a national security threat to Pakistan. Second, to a smaller extent, that they are a burden on the economy and the social services. In fact, the reality is that the large majority of militants fighting against the state are Pakistani citizens and the primary perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the country. This is further evidenced by the fact that terrorist attacks have increased rather than declined since the mass deportation of Afghans began in 2023.
In 2023, there were 141 major incidents of terrorism; in 2024 there were 240, and so far in 2025 there have been 265 major attacks according to data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal. If this policy was to remove a supposed threat to national security, the trend should be the opposite, but clearly the Afghans living in Pakistan were not actually driving terrorism.
 
 

As for the notion that Afghan refugees contribute to major crimes, the data does not support it. Admittedly, more analysis of this is needed, but a study in KP looking at prosecution and police data from 2014 to 2016, showed that only a little over one per cent of major crimes were committed by Afghans.
This low number is in spite of the fact that systemic bias exists against Afghans and cases are registered against them based on their compromised standing in Pakistani society. This data is supported by many studies on the connection of immigrants and refugees to crime globally as well. Given the vulnerable societal position of immigrants and the greater consequences for them, including deportation, they have another reason to stay away from illegal activities.

The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives.

Where the argument about the economic and social services burden is concerned, while it is true that refugees can put pressure on local communities, in the case of Afghans the case is a bit more complex. First, vast funds have been given to Pakistan to house these migrants, and many social service centres, including hospitals and schools, have been opened in the communities by donors to reduce this pressure where Afghans have settled. Second, many Afghans are now an integral part of the local economy where they reside, creating jobs and being contributors to it.
 
 

Third, while the Afghans cannot use government service centres, such as hospitals and schools, in the private sector, many health and educational outlets depend heavily on the business that the migrants generate. The fact that the primary push for the expulsion of Afghan migrants has not come from the communities where they reside, but from elsewhere, shows that economic consequences for communities was not actually a major concern. Hence, a better analysis backed by data should be done rather than making policies based on negative assumptions and prejudice.
Moreover, the reality is that the Afghan diaspora settled in Pakistan have historically formed an important lobby advocating for better Pak-Afghan relations back in their homeland. This group, and their relatives in Afghanistan, have an incentive to advocate for stability in Pakistan and increased trade and cooperation between both countries, since their livelihoods depend on a stable prosperous Pakistan. By expelling Afghans, Pakistan is losing important leverage vis-à-vis Afghanistan for future issues, as well as the significant goodwill they had built.
The reality is that this policy is short-sighted and is not grounded in coherent strategic objectives. Mainstream Pakistan and the establishment have a vision of what it means to be ‘Pakistani’. Unfortunately, those crossing over from the western border do not conform to that image. Many of those being deported, or in the queue, were, in fact, born in Pakistan and have lived here all their lives. Interestingly, some families migrated to Pakistan as early as the late 1970s, just a few years after migrants from India were still moving to Pakistan. However, unlike Afghan migrants, the identity or loyalties of migrants from the eastern border have sensibly not been questioned by the state.
Due to Pakistan’s weak implementation capacity and the policy’s unpopularity in many communities housing Afghan residents, numerous Afghans still reside in Pakistan even after the deadline date has passed. If for no other reason than because of strategic considerations, the government should reconsider this policy. As for mainstream Pakistan, it would greatly benefit from embracing the diversity within the country’s borders rather than fearing it.

At the forefront of the protests has been the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee, which has been pressing for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
The demands range from calls for subsidies to changes in the structure of the AJK legislature. Matters got out of hand on Monday when supporters of the JKJAAC and participants of a Muslim Conference ‘peace rally’ clashed during a strike call. There were more clashes on Wednesday, resulting in at least 10 deaths to date, while the region has also been experiencing a communications blackout.
 
 

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had dispatched a high-level negotiating team on Thursday, including several federal ministers, to try and find a solution to the deadlock. Officials say that “90pc” of the protesters’ demands have been accepted, but two issues remain unresolved — calls for an end to ‘elite privileges’ of AJK’s ministers and officials, and the abolition of reserved seats in the region’s parliament for refugees who had arrived from held Kashmir.
This is the third major round of protests in the region in two years, with many of the outstanding issues unresolved. Where the issue of elite privileges is concerned, the fact is that when officials secure handsome perks for themselves and there is no visible improvement in governance, it is bound to fuel discontent.
 
 

As for subsidies, while the common man should not be overburdened, the state’s financial situation must be kept in mind when demanding financial relief, while tax rates should also be fair and rational. Regarding the abolition of refugee seats, this is a legislative matter, and it should be thoroughly debated in the AJK parliament, which can arrive at a democratic solution acceptable to all.
The fact is that both the state and the protesters need to step back from the brink, and find constructive ways to address contentious issues. Protest is a fundamental right and heavy-handed state actions cannot be condoned. All sides must also keep in mind that this is a very sensitive area, and no actions should be taken that can lead to instability in AJK. Life must be brought back to normal, and long-term solutions need to be debated and found so that the region does not erupt in protest again.

• Pension liabilities rise to Rs1.055tr in 2024-25, driven by armed forces pensions         
ISLAMABAD: With some discretionary changes, the government announced on Friday that federal employees will contribute 10 per cent of their pensionable pay to qualify for a 12pc contribution from the public exchequer under the newly formalised contributory pension fund scheme. The total contribution rate will thus be 22pc, replacing the traditional pension system for new entrants.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) published the “Federal Government Defined Contribution (FGDC) Pension Fund Scheme Rules 2024” under the Public Finance Management Act 2019, which regulates the scheme according to the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2005 and Non-Banking Finance Companies and Notified Entities Regulations 2008. These rules supersede an earlier MoF order of August 2024, which had set the government’s contribution at 20pc.
On Aug 20, 2024, the MoF initially announced the introduction of the contributory pension scheme for new entrants to the civil government and armed forces. At that time, employees were to contribute 10pc of their basic pay, while the government was to contribute 20pc. The new scheme applies to civil employees appointed on or after July 1, 2024, including civilian defence staff, and will extend to armed forces personnel appointed from July 1, 2025, though the latter implementation is pending.
The government allocated Rs10bn for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget and Rs4.3bn in 2025-26 to support the new system.
The scheme was introduced on the advice of international lenders, notably the World Bank, to contain the rising pension liabilities, which the government has described as a growing fiscal risk. It does not apply to existing employees but aims to slow future growth in pension liabilities.
Federal pension expenditure is estimated at Rs1.055tr for 2024-25, up from Rs821bn in 2023-24 — a rise of nearly 29pc in two years. Armed forces pension liabilities account for Rs742bn in 2025-26, up from Rs563bn in 2023-24, an increase of about 32pc. Civilian pension expenditure is budgeted at Rs243bn for the current year, up 6.6pc from Rs228bn in 2023-24, reflecting some savings from reforms.
Under the new rules, only authorised Pension Fund Managers will manage the employer pension funds. The government, acting as the employer, will contribute 12pc of the employee’s pensionable salary through the Accountant General’s office, which will also ensure proper record-keeping and transfer of contributions.
The Accountant General will verify pension account details before salary payments and will collect and transfer employer contributions to the designated Employer Pension Fund. Employees will contribute their 10pc share alongside their salary deductions.
Employees cannot withdraw funds from their pension accounts before retirement. Upon retirement, they may withdraw up to 25pc of their accumulated balance, while the remaining amount must be invested as per the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2002 for at least 20 years or until age 80, whichever comes first.
Salary slips will include detailed information on employee contributions, employer contributions, and total accumulated balances.
The MoF will ensure annual budget allocations for government contributions and will enter agreements with Pension Fund Managers who support electronic transfer systems. These agreements will include mandatory insurance plans offering death and disability coverage, arranged by the Pension Fund Managers.
To oversee implementation and monitoring, the MoF plans to establish a Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC), which will temporarily perform the NBFC’s role until it is formally created.
In cases of resignation, termination, dismissal, or voluntary retirement, employee entitlements from the pension accounts will be determined by government rules issued from time to time.The new pension fund scheme marks a significant shift from the traditional defined benefit pension system towards a defined contribution model aimed at improving fiscal sustainability while providing retirement security for future government employees.

• PPP leaders question her mandate, see no point in ‘continuing alliance’
LAHORE: As Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst against it on flood and canal issues, the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
“Maryam Nawaz will never apologise (to the PPP) for raising her voice for Punjab. Rather, those (PPP leaders) who ridiculed Punjab in times of disaster should apologise,” the Punjab CM said while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the e-bus project in Lahore.
The war of words between the two sides, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N leaders met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces and the PPP leadership.
 
 

“I want to remind (President) Asif Zardari and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that I was deeply hurt when they held three press conferences in a single day mocking Punjab and spreading lies during the flood crisis here,” Maryam said, adding that she had remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she did not want to get into a fight, as she was serving the people of Punjab “24 hours a day and did not have the time”.
She said Punjab wanted to build its own canals from its own resou­rces, but approval was denied at the CCI, and later protests were staged against Punjab. “If this isn’t provincialism, then what is?” she asked.
The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised. Let me make it very clear… Whenever Punjab is targeted, there will be a response and a strong one. Think 100 times before talking negatively about Punjab,” she said.
Further targeting the PPP, she said when floods swept through Pun­jab, the people of one province (PPP in Sindh) not only wrongly criticised the PML-N government in Punjab, but also rubbed salt into the wounds. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.”
Giving an example of how she had offered help to her party’s arch-rival during floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Nawaz said: “I called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered him Punjab’s assistance during the floods despite him being a political opponent.”
BISP vs flood survivors data
On the Benazir Income Support Pro­­gramme, she said she did not wa­­nt the data of poor people but only that of the people affected by floods.
The Punjab CM also defended a controversial YouTuber who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh over the canal issue.
“When someone (the YouTuber) apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people (PPP leaders) made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab,” the PML-N leader warned.
 


False mandate, venomous speeches
Responding to Maryam Nawaz’s diatribe, PPP leader Sassui Palijo said: “Maryam Nawaz does not have a public mandate; rather, she is doing politics on charity seats. Without winning even a single genuine seat, Maryam Nawaz has been given the entire province. The people didn’t even find her worthy of seven seats, yet she was gifted a whole province. Where was your honour when you accepted a province on a charity mandate?”
Ms Palijo further said Maryam had no moral grounds to speak aga­inst smaller provinces, particularly Sindh. “Maryam’s domicile may be powerful, but in reality she is nothing more than a product of Form 47.”
She said false mandates and venomous statements cannot alter reality. “If there is ever a transparent election, Maryam Nawaz will not even be visible in the country’s politics. Her speeches filled with ethnic prejudice and animosity against smaller provinces have become a habit. But politics rooted in hate and lies never lasts long,” the PPP leader said, adding that the people of Sindh would never allow anti-Sindh dams or canals to be built.
Another PPP leader, Maula Bakh­­sh Chandio, said Maryam, after ousting her father Nawaz Sharif from politics, had now taken the driving seat and was targeting the PPP. “This alliance (of PML-N and PPP) cannot continue any more,” he said.

• Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’
• Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv
ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza.
Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan”, saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington.
He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”.
“Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House.
Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia. He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”.
 
 

He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc.
“It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity.
He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked.
He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank.
He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan.
Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said.
Flotilla
Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles.
He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return.
Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission.
The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza.
The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory.
The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police.
Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”.
Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody.
Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.”
The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”.
PM asked to apologise
Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence.
“If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said.
He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions.
The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier.
Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet.
“If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed.
Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.

• FBR, Punjab and Sindh govts under critical scrutiny for missing target, failing to meet cash surplus commitments
• Power sector shows improved recovery, lower circular debt
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan appears well-placed to secure over $1 billion as the third tranche of the Enhanced Fund Facility (EFF) despite some slippages, as the authorities enter policy-level talks with a visiting review mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday.
Informed sources said technical-level discussions had been concluded, indicating that the two sides would need to agree on a couple of waivers during policy-level engagements before wrapping up the review with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb by the weekend (Oct 9-10).
While the power sector has shown unusual performance in terms of improved recovery and a reduction in circular debt — through diversion of fiscal space allocated to subsidies and fresh replacement loans — federal revenues and provincial performance, particularly in promised budget surpluses and agricultural tax collections, have emerged as weak areas.
 
 

A combination of additional measures to be worked out over the next four days, along with relaxations in view of flood-related challenges, is expected to pave the way for the conclusion of the second review. This would lead to the disbursement of the next tranche worth over $1bn by early next month, subject to IMF board approval. The global political environment remains favourable for Pakistan, with major voting members backing the country.
According to the sources, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh remain under critical scrutiny. The FBR not only missed the end-June 2025 revenue target by a wide margin but also recorded a similar shortfall in the first quarter of the current fiscal year — about Rs200bn, with a monthly average of over Rs65bn — despite an expansive transformation plan that included, among other things, a large fleet of vehicles.
The key question now is whether anticipated recoveries from court cases will be enough to bridge the gap or if additional measures will be required at the start of November.
Cash surplus commitments
On the other hand, despite being part of the coalition at the Centre, the Sindh and Punjab governments failed to meet their cash surplus commitments at the close of the last fiscal year, with Sindh even announcing a deficit budget at the outset of FY26. The IMF has used the review to push for corrective measures, as these slippages have also pressured the opposition-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to increase spending for political reasons, despite having so far maintained fiscal discipline.
Given flood-related demands, the provinces are unlikely to perform better this year, although they are being pressed by the IMF to correct their course. This pressure was reflected in Punjab chief minister’s public outburst on Thursday over being held accountable by the IMF for all financial matters. Punjab is required to deliver a Rs740bn surplus to the Centre, followed by Sindh with Rs370bn, KP with Rs220bn, and Balochistan with Rs155bn.
Moreover, both the federal and provincial governments have struggled to establish a comprehensive mechanism for agricultural tax collection. Given the recent floods, they appear more inclined to seek relaxations and waivers rather than implement the laws they passed last year to meet IMF conditions. The provinces have been attempting to link their budget surpluses to the federal government’s revenue collection performance. Both KP and Punjab have reportedly assured the IMF review mission that they will meet flood-related expenses from their own resources.
Although all provinces enacted agricultural income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection — scheduled to begin in September-October this year — remains uncertain, particularly due to the ongoing flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. As a result, authorities remain unclear about the extent of support required for flood-affected people, sectors, and infrastructure.
The dialogue also covered the rising circular debt in the gas sector, partly due to the shifting of liabilities from the power sector. The two sides are discussing benchmarking of the gas sector going forward, focusing on definitions and reporting mechanisms.
So far, the two sides have been unable to resolve issues related to compliance with the state-owned enterprises (SOE) laws, including matters concerning blue-chip companies under the Pakistan Wealth Fund and governance challenges such as public disclosure of assets and retu­rns of government officials across all tiers and organs of the state.
Overall, the authorities’ programme performance as of end-June 2025 has been mixed, and the outlook requires enhanced efforts. The IMF has reportedly rebuffed the authorities’ push for tax-related relaxations to incentivise the upgrading of ageing refineries — putting at risk around $6bn in fresh investment — on the grounds that such relaxations would be counterproductive to the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for climate change.
The policy to incentivise refinery upgrades had been announced two years ago in consultation with the industry, which was in the process of signing binding contracts when the authorities, under the IMF programme, committed not to grant any tax exemptions.
The Petroleum Division has argued that existing refineries produce significant environmental hazards during both refining and consumption, creating health risks and contributing negatively to climate conditions.
While the government is seeking funds under the RSF for various projects, it has been losing ground domestically due to the continued use of outdated refining technology, a situation it blames on what it describes as the IMF negotiators’ technical misunderstanding and the stance of the finance ministry and FBR.
Pakistan has largely met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025 but is lagging in meeting indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future implementation. Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.4bn climate-related RSF, the two sides must agree on both past performance and future implementation prospects.

In a telephone conversation with JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman, the PM said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations.
A statement issued by the PM Office said that the discussion also focused on the broader Middle East conflict, particularly the urgent need for a ceasefire in Palestine and the ongoing violence against innocent Palestinians.
“[PM Shehbaz] reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, emphasising that Pakistan’s stance is clear and resolute. He reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position advocating for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem (Al-Quds) as its capital,” added the statement.
Later, the JI leader also took to X (formerly Twitter), saying that during their conversation, he had also conveyed his party’s reservations to the PM on the proposed peace plan in Gaza.
 






“I also expressed, on behalf of Jamaat-i-Islami as well as the entire nation, serious reservations regarding Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, and stressed that Pakistan must remain firm on the demand for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Pakis­tan should not support any plan that ultimately strengthens Israel,” Hafiz Naeem tweeted.

Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza war, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.
 


Soon after, Trump posted Hamas’ response to his Truth Social account. Trump had earlier not specified whether the terms would be subject to negotiation, as Hamas is seeking.
 


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’ response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce offensive activity in Gaza.
Notably, the resistance group did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza — something Israel and the US want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal the group demands.
A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the besieged enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark.
Hamas seeks further negotiations
In its statement, Hamas said it “appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, as well as the efforts of US President Donald Trump, calling for an end to the war on the Gaza Strip, the exchange of prisoners, (and) the immediate entry of aid,” among other terms.
It said it was announcing its “approval of releasing all occupation captives — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange.”
But Hamas added: “In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details.”
The resistance group said it was ready “to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing.”
Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body.
Earlier, Trump had given Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning the Palestinian resistance group faced “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms.
The US leader set the deadline — which would fall at 1am on Monday in Gaza — after an official for Palestinian group told AFP earlier on Friday that the group still needed time to study the proposal to end nearly two years of devastating war in the Palestinian territory.
“If this last chance agreement is not reached, all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform.
“Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”
 


 
 

The proposal, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself.
Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal, which calls on the resistance group to disarm, a demand it has previously rejected.
“Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump’s plan … and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,” an official had said earlier on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.
On Tuesday, Trump gave Hamas “three or four days” to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Pakistan among Arab and Muslim nations. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, had said in a statement on Friday that the “plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon”.
‘Places of death’
On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency — a rescue force operating under Hamas authority — reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City.
It said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people across the territory, including eight in Gaza City.
AFP has contacted the Israeli military for comment.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence.

The Israeli military is waging an air and ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre, from which hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee.
The UN on Friday reiterated there was no safe place in Gaza and that Israel-designated zones in the south were “places of death”.
“The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” Unicef spokesman James Elder said from the Gaza Strip.
Amnesty International condemned a “catastrophic wave of mass displacement” as Israel intensified its Gaza City offensive.
The rights group said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced multiple times, were being forced into “overcrowded enclaves in the south … that lack access to clean water, food, medical care, shelter and life-sustaining infrastructure”.
As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll continues to rise, protesters around the world have railed at Israel’s interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza.
On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted and Israel’s foreign ministry said it had deported four Italian participants.
‘Two opinions’ in Hamas
As Hamas mulled Trump’s peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement wanted to amend some clauses, including the one on disarmament.
Hamas leaders also want “international guarantees” for a full Israeli withdrawal and that no assassination attempts would be made inside or outside Gaza, the source added.
Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump’s plan.
Structurally, the group’s leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar. Much of Hamas’s leadership has also been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the conflict.
The source told AFP that “the first [opinion] supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump’s guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan”.
“The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses… They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas’s and the resistance factions’ demands,” the source added.
Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said “ultimately it’s not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza”.
“Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,” he added.
The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 66,288 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable. Their data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but indicates that more than half of the dead are women and children.</p><small>2025-10-04 02:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0408453280d2ad5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946403/suspects-interview-by-media-a-grave-violation-of-human-dignity-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Suspects’ interview by media a grave violation of human dignity: LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has declared that recording and broadcasting interviews or confessional statements of under-custody suspects by the media is a grave violation of human dignity, privacy, and the right to a fair trial.
Justice Ali Zia Bajwa announced the verdict, allowing a petition filed by a young lawyer as a public interest litigation, challenging the practice of humiliating and exposing individuals in custody through media trials.
The judge observed that despite being fully aware of their statutory duties, institutions such as the police, FIA, Excise Department, Pemra and PTA had failed to curb the practice.
Reports submitted by these agencies admitted that exposing suspects during custody undermined investigations and weakened prosecution cases.
Justice Bajwa, in a strongly-worded ruling, held that “an arrest, however lawful, does not strip the accused of fundamental rights. Neither the cloak of custody nor the zeal of investigation can justify humiliation, public parading, or compelled confessions.”
He said coerced or publicized confessions amount to persecution, not justice.
The judge said the Constitution guarantees interconnected rights — including dignity (Article 14), liberty (Article 9), fair trial (Article 10-A), and protection against self-incrimination (Article 13) — that extend to every individual, whether free or in custody.
The judge termed custodial media interviews as “media trials” that prejudice public perception, erode the presumption of innocence, and damage the credibility of the justice system.
“Trial by media does more than prejudice the right of an accused to a fair trial, it dents the credibility of the entire criminal justice system,” the judge warned.
Issuing a set of directions, Justice Bajwa ruled that no law enforcement agency shall permit or facilitate media interviews of under-custody accused persons, as such exposure gravely tarnishes and compromises their dignity, self-respect, and future course of life.
The judge said the act constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights and invites unwarranted public prejudice, declining the very essence of fair trial and due process.
The judge maintained that any violation of the order will constitute misconduct, and responsible officers will face legal proceedings.
The judge noted that the heads of investigating agencies shall bear responsibility for ensuring strict compliance and shall not disregard or condone any act of misconduct committed by their subordinates.
Justice Bajwa observed, “It is high time that the role of media be effectively regulated by the competent regulatory authorities to ensure that its unchecked conduct neither transgresses the limits of law nor encroaches upon the fundamental rights, dignity, and liberties of citizens.”
The judge said the humiliation of citizens at pickets and checkpoints by law enforcement agencies, through their exposure to the media for displaying performance, is condemnable.
The judge admitted that the law enforcement agencies are empowered to take action against individuals found involved in violation of the law, however, any attempt to secure media attention at the cost of the dignity, respect, or privacy of citizens shall not be permitted.
Concluding the judgement, Justice Bajwa stressed that freedom of expression under Article 19 of the Constitution cannot override the rights of suspects to dignity, fair trial, and privacy.
Advocate Vishal Riaz, the petitioner, had filed the petition in 2023 challenging the practice of recording interviews/confessional statements of suspects by the mainstream media and vloggers.
Through an interim order, Justice Bajwa had already restrained public functionaries from exposing under trial/custody suspects to media coverage and ordered the Pemra to ensure privacy of the citizens is not invaded by any person carrying a camera or mic.

In UP’s Bareilly, Indian authorities deployed large contingents of security forces ahead of Friday prayers. Internet services have also been suspended till Saturday, 3 pm. Local administration claimed the move was due to recent communal tensions and in light of Dussehra and Durga Puja festivities over the weekend.
Bareilly witnessed violent clashes last week, with over 2,000 protesters clashing with state police outside a mosque after Friday prayers. Local law enforcement arrested at least 81 people after the demonstration.
The issue came to the forefront on September 9, when an FIR was filed against 24 individuals for allegedly putting up posters with ‘I love Muhammad’ during the Eid Miladun Nabi procession on September 4. Hindu groups and right-wing organisations in the region objected to the posters and called it a “deliberate provocation”.
UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also warned of strict action against “rioters”.
A day earlier, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi criticised the heavy-handed response from the state.
“The laws are so designed that it is possible to shower praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but not on the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)”.
“In this country, one can say ‘I love Modi’ but not ‘I love Muhammad’. Where are you taking this nation? If someone says ‘I love Modi’, and erect posters, everyone becomes happy. But if someone says ‘I love Mohammad’, then that is objected to,” added Owaisi.
Jahanzaib Sirwal, a local BJP leader from Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), called for an impartial investigation to hold all wrongdoers accountable and not just one community.
“What was a simple, heartfelt act of faith has been met with FIRs, detentions and inflammatory rhetoric, including Adityanath’s remarks about ‘denting-painting’ and teaching lessons to generations,” said the BJP leader.
He added that such statements were divisive and also an “affront to the constitutional right under Article 25 to freely practice and profess one’s religion”.
Expressing his displeasure, Sirwal also threatened to resign from the party over Adityanath’s “unacceptable” remarks and the “vindictive” attitude of the state police against the Muslim community.
Separately, in Maharashtra’s Ahilyanagar, a demonstration by local Muslims, protesting against ‘I love Muhammad’ graffiti on the road, turned violent earlier this week after the protesters were baton-charged by local police.
Law enforcement officials claimed the protesters blocked a vital thoroughfare in the city and pelted stones at police officials. Police arrested at least 30 people following the incident.
Indian authorities have also demolished properties belonging to Muslims accused of rioting and disturbing law and order.</p><small>2025-10-03 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03225139a78529c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946352/psx-accepts-voluntary-delisting-request-from-tobacco-giant-philip-morris' target='_blank'><strong>PSX accepts voluntary delisting request from tobacco giant Philip Morris</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) accepted the voluntary delisting request from tobacco giant Philip Morris from its index, according to a press release issued on Friday.

Under its influence, wind-thunderstorm and rain of light to moderate intensity is expected in Tharparker, Umerkot, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Tando Muhammad Khan, Hyderabad, Matiari, and Jamshoro districts, as well as at isolated places in Karachi division, as per PMD’s notification.
Hot and dry weather is likely to prevail elsewhere in the province.
The notification stated that sea conditions are likely to remain “rough to very rough” with “squally winds of 40 to 50 gusting 55 km/hour near Sindh coast”.
It also advised fishermen not to venture into the deep sea till Sunday. The met department further warned that windstorms and lightning may “damage weak structures like roofs and walls of kacha houses (temporary dwellings), electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels”.
According to the notification, the weather in Karachi division is expected to remain “mostly cloudy and humid with chances of isolated drizzle” on Saturday, with maximum temperature between 32 and 34 degrees Celsius.
Humidity is expected to be between 75 to 85 per cent in the morning and 60 to 70pc in the evening.
Yesterday, the weather advisory said between October 4 and 6, moist currents from both the Bay of Bengal and the north Arabian Sea are expected to strengthen.</p><small>2025-10-03 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/032056572209f03.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946346/serene-airs-flight-operations-suspended-over-lack-of-serviceable-aircraft-caa' target='_blank'><strong>Serene Air’s flight operations suspended over lack of serviceable aircraft: CAA</strong></a><br><p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on Friday suspended the commercial flight operations of carrier Serene Air over failure to maintain a fleet of serviceable aircraft.

In June, a five-member SC bench ruled 3-2 in favour of the February transfers and said that there was nothing unconstitutional about them. Justices Afghan and Shakeel Ahmed dissented and issued a short note stating that the transfer violated articles 2A, 4 and 25 of the Constitution and “undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality”.
In a copy of today’s dissenting note, available with Dawn.com, Justice Afghan observed that the transfer process for Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Sindh High Court’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro was initiated on January 28 and completed on February 1 — just five days.
Moreover, a letter of consent for the transfer of Balochistan High Court Justice Muhammad Asif was written by the law ministry on January 31, with the judge giving his consent on the same day.
“The process for transfer of three particular judges to IHC was initiated and completed by MoLJ (Ministry of Law and Justice) with unnecessary haste not in the public interest but, prima facie, with the motive to deprive the then Senior Puisne Judge of IHC (Mohsin Akhtar Kayani) of his consideration/appointment as CJ IHC,” the note read.
Afghan’s note also claimed that the transfer was meant to “take over control of the affairs of IHC and District Judiciary of ICT [Islamabad Capital Territory] from the sitting judges of IHC and to hand over the same to the Transferee Judges and Additional Judges in supervision of Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as Senior Puisne Judge IHC and thereafter as Acting CJ IHC and CJ IHC”.
The dissenting note also observed that any decision taken with an “ulterior purpose” is malice in facts.
“Where an action taken is so unreasonable, improbable or blatantly illegal that it ceases to be an action countenanced or contemplated by the law under which it is purportedly taken, malice will be implied and the act would be deemed to suffer from malice in law,” the note read.
According to the dissenting note, the MoLJ secretary requested the president’s authorisation to transfer Justices Dogar and Soomro, but did not approach him about approving Justice Asif.
Additionally, it noted that there was no record of the criteria against which the three IHC judges were transferred. It continued that in terms of seniority, Dogar was the 15th most senior judge at the LHC, Soomro was 20th in the SHC, while Asif had only taken his post as an additional judge at the BHC on January 18 — the same month as the transfer process was initiated.
“All the above transpire that the process for [the] transfer of three Judges
from LHC, SHC and BHC to IHC vide impugned notification is suffering
from malice in facts as well as malice in law,” the dissenting note read.
It stated that the transfer of the three judges dealt a “serious blow” to judicial independence and affected the working relationship between the IHC’s judges.
“Due to [the] issuance of the impugned notification by the president in
wrong exercise of discretion, a ripple has been caused in the comity of
judges and the turbulence created in [the] IHC has seriously affected the
working relationship amongst the judges of IHC which has consequently
affected the smooth working and disposal of IHC making the litigants to
suffer at large,” the dissenting note read.
“The issuance of [the] impugned notification in wrong exercise of discretion by the President has frustrated the legitimate expectancy of the sitting Judges of IHC,” it added, referring to judges who were more senior than Justices Dogar, Soomro and Asif.</p><small>2025-10-03 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03201318fbb916f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946344/uk-police-may-have-accidentally-shot-dead-victim-in-synagogue-attack' target='_blank'><strong>UK police may have accidentally shot dead victim in synagogue attack</strong></a><br><p>British police said on Friday they accidentally shot a victim who died in the attack on a synagogue in Manchester, as well as one of the survivors, as they attempted to stop an attacker who appeared to be wearing an explosive belt.
In Thursday’s attack, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed after a British man of Syrian descent drove a car into pedestrians and then began stabbing people outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.
The attacker, shot dead by officers at the scene, was not carrying a firearm, said Greater Manchester Police chief constable Steve Watson, though one of those killed suffered a gunshot wound.
“It follows, therefore, this injury may have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” Watson said in a statement.
The attack comes as Israel has drawn widespread criticism over its ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has killed over 66,000 people since October 7, 2023.
UK vows to crack down on antisemitism
Watson said another worshipper is believed to have suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, and that it is thought both victims were close together behind the synagogue door, as worshippers tried to prevent the attacker from gaining entry.
The police complaints watchdog said it was carrying out an investigation into what happened.
Police have named the attacker as Jihad al-Shamie, 35, and said they could find no records to show he had been referred to the government’s anti-radicalisation programme.
In a statement on Facebook, Shamie’s family said they were in “profound shock” and wanted to distance themselves from what they called his “heinous act”.
The British government vowed to redouble its efforts to tackle antisemitism as the Jewish community reeled from the attack.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the site of the attack and spoke with police and ambulance workers, praising “the degree of professionalism and speed” they showed in their response.
When Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy spoke at a vigil outside the synagogue on Friday, he was heckled by people who said “Jews don’t want to live here anymore” and urged him to stop the pro-Palestinian marches that have taken place in British cities regularly since the start of the genocide in Gaza.
Britain, like other European countries and the United States, has recorded a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in the nearly two years since the conflict began.

Last year was the second-worst on record for such incidents, surpassed only by 2023, according to the Community Security Trust, which provides security to Jewish organisations across Britain. It recorded more than 3,500 incidents in 2024.
Many Jewish leaders noted that they were the only faith in Britain that routinely required security at its institutions.
Islamophobic incidents in Britain have also increased since the start of the Gaza conflict.
Last month, Starmer announced that Britain was recognising a Palestinian state in the hope of reviving peace for Palestinians and Israelis, a decision decried by Israel as a “huge reward to terrorism”.
Pro-Palestinian protests
Israel has accused Britain of allowing rampant antisemitism to spread through its cities and universities, and repeated that criticism after Thursday’s attack.

Police, meanwhile, urged organisers of a planned protest in support of a banned pro-Palestinian group in London this weekend to cancel or postpone the event, saying it would divert police resources needed to protect fearful communities.
Organisers said the protest, the latest in a series in which police have arrested more than 1,500 people, would go ahead, and that it was the police’s choice whether to make more arrests of people “peacefully holding signs”.
Manchester, in northwestern England, is a highly diverse city home to the country’s largest Jewish community outside London.
On Friday morning, there was a heavy police presence at the scene of the attack, with debris still lying in the street and bunches of flowers being left nearby.</p><small>2025-10-03 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0312392897d42a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946307/ppp-journalists-briefly-boycott-national-assembly-session' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, journalists briefly boycott National Assembly session</strong></a><br><p>Members of the PPP and media representatives briefly boycotted the National Assembly session on Friday over separate matters.
The PPP, which is a coalition partner of the ruling PML-N in the Centre, has been incensed after Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks amid an ongoing rift between the two parties over flood relief. Meanwhile, journalists have been protesting a raid by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC) yesterday, during which media persons were assaulted.
A while after the NA session began today, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said, “I want to say this on record that in the last session, we had raised some issues. We had also protested and walked out. After that, the government sent a team that engaged in dialogue with us.”
He, however, maintained that nothing changed despite the talks. “There has been no difference on the ground […] We cannot be a part of this House until this matter is resolved.”
“So, we are walking out today,” he announced.
Later, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar began his speech by expressing the hope that differences between the PPP and PML-N would be resolved. He also requested Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain to talk and convince PPP leaders to rejoin the session if they had not left parliament by then.
As Dar continued his speech, some of the PPP members were seen returning to the hall amid applause.
At that, the foreign minister expressed gratitude and said the issues between the two parties would be resolved with the involvement of the leadership on both sides.
The PPP had walked out of the last NA session as well on September 30 over Maryam’s remarks.
The war of words between the two sides, which had begun over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP had lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam.
Journalists walk out
Separately, a Dawn.com correspondent at the NA reported that journalists, too, had boycotted today’s session over yesterday’s police raid at the NPC.
Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) walked out of the press gallery, led by PRA President MB Soomro and Secretary Naveed Akbar.
A statement issued by the PRA in this connection said the NPC was “home to journalists” that was attacked by Islamabad police yesterday. “Violence against journalists and such incidents are becoming common,” it said, adding that the PRA considered these occurrences as a “reflection of undemocratic thinking”.
The association also strongly condemned the incident.
 
 

While journalists boycotted the session, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq urged that some treasury bench members hold dialogue with journalists.
Subsequently, Public Affairs Minister Rana Mubashir Iqbal, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik and Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani went to the NA’s press lounge on the speaker’s directives. Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudry also reached the press lounge.
Tallal assured the journalists that their demands would be fulfilled, condemned the raid at the NPC and expressed solidarity with journalists.
He said the law minister had been in contact with him over the matter and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, too, had been briefed on it.
On assurances by government representatives regarding the fulfilment of their demands, journalists decided to postpone the boycott.

No exact date was given in the announcement, which was posted on X.
“High Commissioner [Dr Muhammad Faisal] is grateful to the Civil Aviation Authority UK for issuing the Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit (FOP) today, the final document enabling commercial flights between the UK and Pakistan,” the post read.
“PIA has already received the Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations in the United Kingdom, and in the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included.”
 






In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-10-03 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03195528ab4b82f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946343/qaiser-seeks-pms-apology-for-hurting-public-sentiment-over-palestine-issue' target='_blank'><strong>Qaiser seeks PM’s apology for ‘hurting public sentiment over Palestine issue’</strong></a><br><p>Former National Assembly speaker and senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif apologise to the nation “for hurting public sentiments on the issue of Palestine”.
Addressing the lower house on Friday, the PTI leader said “no decision would be acceptable until the will of the Palestinian people was made part of the process”.
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the 20-point Gaza peace plan released by US President Donald Trump was “not ours” but insisted that there was no room for politicking on the matter.
Eight Muslim and Arab countries — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — held a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
On Sept 29, US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met and, in a press conference after the meeting, announced the former’s 20-point plan for Gaza. However, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s initial welcoming of the plan, Dar had later made it clear in so many words that the plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
Speaking on the floor today, Qaiser criticised the government for failing to take the parliament into confidence on key national decisions. Referring to the ‘peace plan’ presented by Trump, Qaiser claimed no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Shehbaz “in a display of sycophancy” acknowledged an incomplete agreement through social media.
“If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it,“ asked the PTI leader and added that the premier had played with the “emotions of the Pakistani people”. He further stated that the people of Pakistan would never accept the recognition of Israel.
“Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as its capital,” he asserted. Qaiser also demanded immediate diplomatic efforts for the release of Pakistanis detained on the Flotilla.
Referring to the foreign minister’s clarification on the Shama Junejo controversy raised more questions and the responsibility lay with the premier as she was the “prime minister’s speech writer”.
Columnist and social media activist Junejo claimed earlier that Prime Minister Shehbaz had included her among the delegates as an adviser.
The controversy had surfaced when photos from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s address at a UN Security Council session on artificial intelligence (AI) spread like wildfire on social media platform X, with users pointing to Junejo sitting in the background. Several of them also shared screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel — a position sharply at odds with Pakistan’s longstanding pro-Palestinian stance.
After social media furore, Asif said on X that only the Foreign Office could explain Junejo’s presence at the session. Later, the FO clarified that she had not been part of Pakistan’s accredited delegation.</p><small>2025-10-03 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03150532a17cd80.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946316/tallal-chaudhry-apologises-for-press-club-incident-assures-steps-to-prevent-reoccurrence' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry apologises for press club incident, assures steps to prevent reoccurrence</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudry on Friday apologised for the attack on journalists in Islamabad a day prior, assuring the media that steps will be taken to ensure such an incident does not reoccur.
On Thursday, a raid was carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly assaulted. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises.
Moreover, visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had ordered an inquiry into the incident.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad today, Tallal said that he apologises for the incident on behalf of the government and that the information minister was on board regarding the matter. Condemning the incident, he reassured the media that steps will be taken so no one dares to “disrespect the press club” again.
“I went to the press club immediately and asked for an unconditional apology,” Tallal said. “Whatever shortcomings there have been, we have apologised and action will be taken.”
When it comes to freedom of speech, journalists, and the sanctity of the press club, Tallal reiterated that “there can be no compromise”. He added that the administration of the press club and other stakeholders will collectively make a decision and the corresponding action will be seen.
Meanwhile, in a post on X, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also condemned the incident, saying the decision to investigate it is a good step, but it should not be a mere formality.
“The officials who are irresponsible and abusive should be identified and punished under the law,” Senator Siddiqui said. “While keeping the investigation process transparent, journalist organisations should also be involved.”
He added that the sanctity of press clubs should not be violated. “No justification for violence against a journalist performing professional duties can be acceptable. A solid arrangement to permanently prevent such actions is very important,” he said.
 






In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is “standing at a crossroad amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners”.
Last year, Pakistan dropped two places in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, with the country ranking 152 out of 180 countries.

During the month, the commission stated that “14 missing persons returned home”. From March 2011 to September 2025, the commission received 10,636 cases, out of which 8,986 cases have been disposed of, while 1,650 cases are under investigation.
“The disposal of cases works out to be 84.48 per cent consequent to the investigation of cases,” stated the monthly report.
The report further stated that the commission has disposed of 289 cases during the three-month period of July-September, at approximately 96 cases per month.
The commission said it has also taken steps for the welfare of families of missing persons, establishing a cell “providing relief to families by addressing matters such as the issuance of Form B of children of missing persons and the grant of pension to families of missing persons, who happen to be government servants”.
Last month, a civil society organisation called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to “re-evaluate the entire mechanism for resolving the issue of enforced disappearances.”
In August 2024, the United Nations asked Pakistan to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and allocate adequate human, technical and financial resources for developing, adopting and implementing measures to prevent and end enforced disappearances among ethnic minority groups and ensure their safety and security.
In December last year, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emp­hasised that only parliament holds the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-03 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03191950464db64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946336/fbr-uncovers-customs-fraud-at-karachi-airport-detects-rs384m-in-duty-evasion' target='_blank'><strong>FBR uncovers customs fraud at Karachi airport, detects Rs384m in duty evasion</strong></a><br><p>A major customs fraud was uncovered at Karachi airport, where employees of a foreign ground-handling company and corrupt importers allegedly smuggled out high-value electronics without paying duties and taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said in a statement on Friday.
“Acting on intelligence, authorities seized a consignment worth Rs103 million, including laptops, iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, PlayStations, and memory cards,” the statement said.
According to FBR, five consignments by a company registered in Dubai were cleared using fake gate passes while being concealed from the Web-Based One Customs (WeBOC) system, resulting in an estimated duty and tax evasion of Rs384 million.
“Two first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged, employees arrested, and further arrests are expected,” the statement said.
It added that the operation reflected the FBR’s “commitment to safeguarding national revenue”, warning that negligent customs officials would not be spared.
FBR has lately been intensifying its crackdown on tax evasion and smuggling, carrying out a series of operations at ports and airports across the country to safeguard national revenue.
Last month, it emerged that the revenue watchdog launched a “Lifestyle Monitoring Cell” with 40 investigators to scan Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube for signs of tax evasion.</p><small>2025-10-03 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03183005bb15812.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946333/india-set-to-receive-first-afghan-taliban-minister-after-unsc-temporarily-lifts-travel-ban' target='_blank'><strong>India set to receive first Afghan Taliban minister after UNSC temporarily lifts travel ban</strong></a><br><p>The UN Security Council (UNSC) Committee has temporarily lifted a travel ban on the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, which would allow him to visit India between October 9 and 16, India’s foreign ministry said on Friday.
If confirmed, it would be the first visit to India by a senior leader of the Taliban-run Afghan administration since it seized power in 2021 after 20 years of US military presence.
Delhi and Kabul have traditionally enjoyed close ties when the Islamist Taliban were not in power.
Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is among Afghan Taliban members who are under UN sanctions, including a travel ban and asset freeze. Temporary exemptions are sometimes granted for diplomacy. The Afghan administration did not immediately respond to inquiries about Muttaqi’s travel plans.
India’s foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters that New Delhi had already been speaking to the Afghan administration, and noted that it had provided support after an earthquake on August 31. He did not specifically confirm that the visit would take place.
Indian and Afghan media have reported that Muttaqi will travel to Russia before visiting New Delhi.
In Moscow, he is expected to discuss the situation in Afghanistan with representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries, the reports say.
Hekmatullah Hekmat, an Afghan political analyst, said the visit to India was highly significant for the Taliban government:
“Afghanistan is in dire need of establishing relations with regional countries, especially its neighbours. It needs to build political, economic, and trade ties and to gain recognition.”
Only Russia has so far recognised the Taliban government. India closed its embassy in Kabul in 2021, but a year later opened a technical mission to coordinate humanitarian assistance.</p><small>2025-10-03 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0315292063f62b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946311/indian-air-force-chief-repeats-implausible-claims-of-downing-5-paf-jets' target='_blank'><strong>Indian air force chief repeats ‘implausible’ claims of downing 5 PAF jets</strong></a><br><p>Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh on Friday claimed that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
“As far as air defence part is concerned, we have evidence of one long-range strike … along with that five fighters, high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class, our system tells us,” Singh told reporters at the Indian Air Force annual day press conference. However, he did not share the said evidence.
The F-16 is a US-made fighter jet, while the JF-17 is of Chinese origin.
Although Singh had previously too claimed without credible evidence that five Pakistani fighter jets and another military aircraft were shot down during the conflict, this is the first time New Delhi has mentioned the class of jets in public. He also refused to comment on Pakistan downing Indian jets in May.
The first time the Indian air chief had claimed that Pakistan’s jets were downed during the four-day escalation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had dismissed the “implausible” Indian assertions, offering instead to open both countries’ air fleets to independent verification.
“The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed,” Khawaja Asif had said in a sharply worded August statement. “It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians.”
He also said that India did not make any such claims for three months after the conflict ended, while Pakistan immediately presented deta­iled technical briefings to the international media, and independent obser­vers recorded widespread acknowledgement of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, to foreign intelligence assessments.
Indian air chief’s latest claims of downing jets come a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a United Nations General Assembly speech, said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Earlier this week, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “seven aircraft shot down” and tensions rapidly escalating between the two neighbours.
In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale.
New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
The May fighting, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan.
Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
Ties between the countries have downgraded since the attack, with the impact being felt in areas ranging from trade and travel to sports.
India has also kept in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan termed an “act of war”.</p><small>2025-10-03 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/03171334eb664e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946328/bookings-open-as-india-and-china-set-to-resume-direct-flights-after-5-years' target='_blank'><strong>Bookings open as India and China set to resume direct flights after 5 years</strong></a><br><p>India and China will resume direct flights between their two countries this month after a five-year suspension, officials said, with bookings opening on Friday.
Direct flights between the world’s two most populous countries were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and were not resumed as tensions grew between Beijing and New Delhi over border disputes.
Relations between the Asian rivals have since thawed, and their leaders spoke in China in August and in Kazan, Russia, last year.
Following technical discussions, “it has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October”, an Indian government statement released on Thursday said.
“This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges,” it said.
IndiGo, India’s largest commercial operator, said today it would start direct daily flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou from October 26 and later expand operations to New Delhi.
 






The airline opened bookings on Friday and said the direct flights would “re-establish avenues for cross-border trade and strategic business partnerships and promote tourism between the two nations”.
India and China announced in August that they would restart direct flights, advance talks on their disputed border and boost trade.
Relations between China and India plummeted in 2020 after their soldiers clashed along a disputed border in the Himalayan mountains. Four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian troops were killed in the worst violence between the two countries in decades.
In June, Beijing granted permission to Indian pilgrims wishing to trek to Mount Kailash in Tibet, a holy site for Hindus and Buddhists, for the first time since the 2020 clash.</p><small>2025-10-03 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/031103417bd4e74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946297/shc-suspends-ku-notification-cancelling-ihc-judge-jahangiris-law-degree' target='_blank'><strong>SHC suspends KU notification cancelling IHC judge Jahangiri’s law degree</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court on Friday suspended a notification issued by the University of Karachi (KU) that cancelled the law degree of Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The court’s decision came during the hearing of a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri on Monday impugning the decisions of the KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The KU registrar, the Sindh advocate general and others appeared before the court as it took up the plea today. They sought more time for submitting their replies on the plea, saying that they had received notices pertaining to the case yesterday.
At that, Justice Iqbal Kalhoro remarked, “We are ready to give more time but what if any action is taken against the petitioner in this duration? If we accept your request today and any action is taken tomorrow, who will take responsibility in that case?”
He further enquired whether the respondents had issued any notice to Jahangiri before “taking action against him”.
Noting that questions were being raised on Justice Jahangiri’s degree, Justice Kalhoro observed that he should have been issued a notice if an application was moved against him 30 to 35 years after the issuance of his degree.
He further stated, “We are not saying that action cannot be taken against him because the law allows it … [but] how can we put someone’s honour at stake? Someone’s life-long earning is at stake here.”
The court then adjourned the hearing, seeking replies from respondents on October 24.
The petition
In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”.
Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties.
He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s law degree began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations regarding the validity of the degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, the IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, a writ petition was filed, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that the petitioner was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the Supreme Court (SC). The IHC decision was declared “null and void” by the SC on Sept 30.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea by Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions challenging the cancellation of his law degree. As lawyers protested the move, the bench also dismissed the set of pleas against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree for “non-prosecution”.
On Thursday, Justice Jahangiri moved the SC, challenging the SHC ruling of dismissing his application.</p><small>2025-10-03 08:09</small></div><hr>
