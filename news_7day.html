Record rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
Speaking during a federal cabinet meeting today, PM Shehbaz said, “I will call a meeting over the illegal constructions on rivers, such as hotels, restaurants and houses.”
He highlighted the concerns over such structures, which reflected “catastrophic beauty”, and over the cutting of trees in Galiyat, where plazas and houses have been constructed.
“There is no room for man-made disasters,” he said, adding that the meeting will be called on an all-Pakistan basis to discuss these issues.
The premier discussed the relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected areas during the meeting, saying that the federal government has extended “full cooperation” to the provincial governments, Radio Pakistan reported.
PM Shehbaz also commended the efforts of the armed forces in rescue and relief operations. “Pakistan Army reached the distant and difficult areas to rescue the people. For this purpose, helicopters were also used,” he said.
He mentioned his visit to flood-affected areas in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, highlighting the efforts of ministers and secretaries. He said, “This is a collective responsibility.”
“For how long will the provincial and federal governments keep giving compensation for illegal structures?” he questioned.
 
 

The prime minister also condoled the casualties, stating, “over 700 people, including over 400 in KP lost their lives in the recent rains and flash floods,” according to Radio Pakistan.
“He emphasised that the responsibility of climate change ministry has increased to deal with the issue of climate change. He said other relevant departments will also have to play their part in it,” the report added.
The premier mentioned the recent “destructive rains” in Karachi from earlier this week. “I talked to the Sindh chief minister and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to express my sympathies,” he said.
PM Shehbaz on Wednesday visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner and Shangla in KP, as 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori.
While interacting with flood victims, he assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support to them “in this critical hour”.
On Monday, the KP government released Rs800 million in relief funds for all affected districts, with an additional Rs500m specifically for worst-hit Buner, as flash floods continue to ravage the province with the death toll at 385.</p><small>2025-08-22 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221213159fab4e9.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933741/javelin-star-yasir-throws-seasons-best-to-clinch-bronze-at-asian-throwing-championships' target='_blank'><strong>Javelin star Yasir throws season’s best to clinch bronze at Asian Throwing Championships</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s javelin sensation Muhammad Yasir Sultan threw a season’s best of 77.43m to clinch a bronze medal at the Asian Throwing Championships in Mokpo, South Korea on Friday.
The 27-year-old threw a massive 77.43m on his sixth and final attempt to snag a podium finish and smash his previous season’s best of 76.07m set at the Asian Athletics Championships in May.
Sri Lanka’s Pathirage Rumesh Tharanga won gold with an 82.05m throw and became the only athlete to cross the 80m barrier this morning. Behind him was Japan’s Gen Naganuma with 78.60m.
 


Yasir opened his campaign with a no-throw, followed by a solid 75.79m. He the then threw two successive throws in the 72m range before anther no-throw on his fifth attempt.
It was on his final attempt that he struck his medal-winning 77.43m throw.
Yasir said in a social media post that he was “happy for a podium finish” and season’s best throw despite “tough conditions”.
He thanked his supporters and hoped for more medals in the future.

Yasir clinched a silver at last year’s championships with a 78.10m throw, and a bronze in 2023 with a 79.93m throw, which still stands as his personal best.
The javelin ace has yet to shatter the 80m barrier.

The deputy investigation of Lahore Police confirmed to Dawn.com that Shershah Khan, akin to his brother Shahrez Khan, was also arrested today for his involvement in the May 9 riots.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir Umar, said that “Shershah was taken from his house after his appearance at a Lahore anti-terrorism court in relation to his brother’s case”.
The PTI, in a post on X, called the incident an “abduction” and lamented that “the rule of law has been replaced with the law of the jungle”.
 






The move comes a day after PTI announced that men in plainclothes had “abducted” the son of Aleema Khanum from her residence. Lahore police later announced that Shahrez had been arrested in connection with a May 9 case.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Lahore ATC judge sends Shahrez on 8-day physical remand
A Lahore anti-terrorism court on Friday sent Imran’s nephew Shahrez on an eight-day physical remand after he was arrested a day earlier in connection with a May 9 case.
The suspect was presented in a Lahore anti-terrorism court today, where the hearing was presided over by Judge Manzar Ali Gul.
The investigating officer told the judge that Shahrez was arrested in relation to the Jinnah House attack on May 9. He added that the suspect was first named in the case on September 23 in 2023, in supplementary statements.
To this, Shahrez’s counsel, PTI’s Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alleged that his client had never been named in the case, branding the arrest an act of “harassment”.
He questioned why he had never been arrested before, despite being in the country for 27 months. The legal counsel called the move a “reaction to the approval of Imran’s bail pleas”.
On Wednesday,  the Supreme Court accepted Imran’s bail petitions in eight cases related to the May 9 riots. The PTI founder has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail since August 2023 in cases related to the selling of state gifts and a £190 million graft case, while he faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The investigation officer filed an application in the court for a 30-day physical remand for police investigation; however, the court approved only eight days and directed the police to present
Raja, speaking to the media outside the court, said Shahrez was “falsely implicated”. He vowed to fight against the case, saying, “We will go to every court.”
“This is a message to the nation that there is no law in this country,” he said, adding that “cases are being fabricated”.
Questioning the validity of the case, Raja alleged that during the events of May 9, Shahrez was in Chitral.
“This is madness and a well-thought-out conspiracy,” he added. “We have to stand with the founder of PTI and his family.”</p><small>2025-08-22 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221423362cbdf58.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933933/commerce-minister-meets-bangladesh-govt-adviser-to-discuss-bilateral-trade-enhancement' target='_blank'><strong>Commerce minister meets Bangladesh govt adviser to discuss bilateral trade enhancement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s commerce minister and a Bangladeshi government adviser met in Dhaka on Friday to discuss the enhancement of bilateral trade and the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
A press release by the Ministry of Commerce said that Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, who reached Dhaka on August 21 for an official visit, met with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Commerce Sheikh Bashir Uddin.  During the interaction, both sides “held in-depth discussions in Dhaka today to advance economic cooperation, mutual investments and strengthen bilateral trade ties”.
It added that Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Imran Haider, was also present during the meeting.
“The two countries are in the process of establishing a Joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade,” the statement said.
According to the ministry, both sides agreed to re-activate the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) forum to work out a comprehensive strategy for the promotion of trade, investment and economic collaborations.
The statement pointed out that the last meeting of the JEC was held in 2005.
The two sides also agreed to form a joint trade commission, which would present a roadmap for building on the existing bilateral trade relations, set goals for future commercial ties and define steps to achieve those targets.
“The minister and adviser discussed sectors including agricultural modernisation, renewable energy, steel industry, green ship breaking, ship building, dates, minerals, construction aggregates, halal trade, sugar, leather, rice, dehydrated fruits and agro-processing,” the ministry said.
The two noted the need to improve and economise connectivity and logistics for trade to cut costs. They also discussed the reduction of tariffs and duties and preferential access to certain Bangladeshi products in the Pakistani market.
Both sides underscored that there was a vast untapped potential of bilateral trade and that both countries were “all set to benefit” from such opportunities.
 
 

“The two governments should build on the existing momentum and swiftly move to create a more conducive environment,” the ministry statement concluded.
The commerce minister is currently on a visit to Bangladesh. He was received by Bashir Uddin upon his arrival in Dhaka yesterday.
“Looking forward to engagements with officials and business leaders,” he said on social media.
 






Yesterday, he held discussions with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Industries Adilur Rahman Khan to explore avenues for industrial cooperation between the two countries. He emphasised Pakistan’s interest in being a part of Bangladesh’s evolving industrial landscape through collaboration, joint ventures and mutual investment.</p><small>2025-08-22 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2213022692d6e4f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933779/200-people-rescued-after-glacial-burst-in-gilgit-baltistans-ghizer-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>200 people rescued after glacial burst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 200 people were rescued after a glacier burst in Gilgit-Baltistan blocked the Ghizer River, threatening the downstream areas, Rescue 1122 said on Friday.
A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (Glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream, effectively blocking or overwhelming rivers in its path. Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
A statement from Rescue 1122 said, “200 people have been rescued from flood-affected areas and have been shifted to Ghizer’s Yangal and Samal areas.”
“Several people have been traumatised after [their] houses were destroyed. Medical assistance is being provided to the affected people,” it added.
In another statement issued earlier today, Rescue 1122 said, “A terrible incident of glacier outburst has taken place at Tildas and Rawshan villages in Gupis valley late at night, causing widespread destruction in the downstream.”
“The Ghizer River has been completely blocked for several hours, which has increased the risks for downstream areas with a possibility of high-level flooding in the river,” it added.
The statement said that the rescue personnel had been kept on alert on the orders of the Rescue 1122 director general and the Rescue 1122 District Emergency Officer Engineer Tahir Shah. Rescue 1122 also urged people living near the river to take timely precautionary measures and move to safe places.
GB Secretary Fida Hussain said that no casualties were reported and all the affected people were safe.
“The flood swept away everything in the downstream areas in Talidas and Rawshan villages,” he said, adding that 40 people, who were stranded, had been rescued.
He added that local volunteers were the first to rescue people from the floodwaters, after which Pakistan Army helicopters joined the operation.
“The high temperature caused a burst of the lake, and ultimately high flooding occurred in the Sado nullah on Wednesday night.
“Some shepherds informed the local community about the flood. People in dangerous areas were immediately shifted to other areas,” he said.
According to the locals, 80 per cent of the village has been washed away. A local named Abdul Wahid said, “Some shepherds, who were living near the glacier, had informed people living in the downstream areas through mobile communication about the flood and urged them to evacuate.”
The local administration said that the Ghizer River, after remaining blocked for eight hours, started spilling over the flood debris.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that a rescue operation was initiated to evacuate the stranded people in the areas. He said, “The flow of the Ghizer River has remained blocked for many hours, but it poses a threat to low-lying areas if it bursts.”
Ghulam Muhammad, GB Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism, said, “The flood, which occurred due to the bursting of the lake, completely destroyed 70 houses, while the river water is standing due to the flood debris, but the level is rising.”
He said that if the flow of the river water is not restored, hundreds of large houses will be submerged in the water. “The process of flooding in the drain due to the bursting of the lake has been ongoing since 10pm.”
Muhammad further said that the river spread three to four kilometres in length due to the standing water.
“Some people are still trapped, for whom an army helicopter has been sent to rescue them. Hopefully, the trapped people will also be rescued,” he added.

GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan issued orders to the GB home secretary and GB Disa­ster Manage­ment Aut­h­ority director general to immediately rescue the people trapped in the flood.
The CM said, “All available resources will be utilised to rescue the precious human lives and help will be sought from the Pakistan Army.”
He also directed the Gilgit and Ghizer police officials and the concerned departments to ensure safety measures in the settlements adjacent to the river.
Special Assistant to CM on Information Eman Shah said that authorities have started initial relief and rescue activities. “Steps are being taken to shift people from Ghizer River downstream areas to safer places in fear of the temporary lake formed in Ghizer bursting,” he said.
Earlier this month, a Glof from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.
A glacier burst in Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person on Aug 1, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-22 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2213462894439ab.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933862/indias-top-court-revises-stray-dog-policy-after-public-outcry' target='_blank'><strong>India’s top court revises stray dog policy after public outcry</strong></a><br><p>India’s Supreme Court modified its order on stray dogs on Friday, directing that those picked up from streets in and around Delhi be released after sterilisation and immunisation, after a storm of protests from animal lovers.
Earlier this month, the court ruled that all stray dogs in Delhi and its suburbs be moved to shelters following a surge in dog bites and cases of rabies. Critics of the ruling had said it could not be implemented because there were not enough shelters.
Many animal lovers took to the streets to protest against the order. Animal rights activists signed online petitions asking the court to revoke its decision.
The court ruling also drew criticism from politicians and celebrities.
India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi called it a “step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy”.
 






On Friday, the court said that dogs picked up in the past few weeks in Delhi and its suburbs would be released after sterilisation and immunisation, barring those showing aggressive behaviour or signs of rabies infection.
Former federal minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi told ANI news agency that she was happy with the “scientific decision” of relocating dogs back to their area. The court has not clarified what “an aggressive dog” is and this remains a grey area, she added.
In April, the government said nearly 430,000 cases of dog bites were reported nationwide in January, against 3.7 million cases in all of 2024.
India has 52.5m stray dogs, a survey of homeless pets by Mars Petcare has shown, with 8m canines in shelters. Media reports suggest Delhi alone has 1m stray dogs. Reuters could not independently verify the figure.
To curb public feeding of stray dogs, the court also directed the setting-up of designated zones.
A three-judge panel of the court said the scope of the case would be expanded across India and the court would formulate a uniform policy for all stray dogs soon.
“On behalf of the community dogs we serve, we thank the three-judge bench for its decision,” animal rights group PETA India said on Friday, urging people to adopt dogs and support sterilisation efforts.

A massive explosion took place inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on MA Jinnah Road yesterday afternoon, in which 33 people were injured and two were confirmed to have lost their lives.
Rescue 1122 said today that the number of deaths from the incident had risen to four.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that one of the victims had died from suffocation, while two others had also suffered “multiple crush injuries”.
She added that the fourth victim’s autopsy had not yet been done.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the facility was situated in the basement of a three-storey commercial and residential building in Saddar.
“Raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers was stored [in this facility],” Khan said. “During the initial probe, it was suspected that a short circuit triggered a fire in the store, and a huge explosion took place because of the presence of highly inflammable material.”
However, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) senior official Raja Umer Khattab told reporters that the facility contained explosive material, not raw material for fireworks.
“CTD had seized two tons of explosive material in this area in the recent past,” he said, noting that the raw material in fireworks could also be used in bombs.
The rescue spokesperson added that the building’s pillars and walls were damaged, while thick concrete blocks had fallen on parked vehicles nearby. Windows in nearby buildings were also smashed.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Earlier this month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control after hours of efforts.</p><small>2025-08-22 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221154003aa905b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930671/no-room-to-feed-the-hidden-struggles-of-working-mothers-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>No room to feed: The hidden struggles of working mothers in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>“During my shift, there is nowhere to breastfeed and no extra time during breaks,“ said a lactating mother employed in the retail sector. “By the time I get home, my baby is crying with hunger. I have no choice but to leave her with a milk bottle, which breaks my heart.”
Her words echo in factories, offices, and classrooms across Pakistan, where mothers are often forced to choose between their newborn’s nutrition — crucial in the early months — and maintaining a livelihood.
The reality is stark: only 48 per cent of infants under six months in the country are exclusively breastfed, far below the global target of at least 70pc. According to Unicef, this shortfall is directly linked to high rates of stunting (low height for their age, resulting from chronic poor nutrition, repeated infections, and inadequate care, particularly during the first 1,000 days of life), 37pc, and wasting (a severe form of malnutrition where a child is dangerously thin for their height, indicating recent and severe weight loss), 7pc, among Pakistani children under the age of five.
While the benefits of breastfeeding — from protecting children against infections to lowering mothers’ risk of cancer and diabetes — are well-documented, it seems that Pakistan’s workplace culture is either unaware of them or has turned a blind eye toward them.
The tough choice
Many women, struggling to balance motherhood and a career, return to work within weeks of childbirth. Maternity leave — up to 180 days under the Maternity and Paternity Leave Act, 2023 — is often too short or unpaid. The situation only gets worse; lactation rooms are rare, and daycare facilities are barely functional.
“There is no clean space to feed or pump, and if I ask for extra time, they cut my wages,” said a mother who works at a garment factory in Karachi.
 
 

For those in leadership roles, the struggle takes a different shape.
“I wanted to set up a breastfeeding space for one of my female team members, but when I raised the idea before management, it wasn’t supported,“ shared a Karachi-based woman, employed at a non-profit organisation. “I didn’t push further due to the fear of losing my position.”
In these circumstances, some mothers are even forced to simply quit the labour force altogether because it fails to accommodate them.
“When my baby was born, I had to choose between going back to work or staying home to breastfeed him. I chose my baby, and I am not sure if I will ever return — but I know this choice gives me peace,” said another new mother.
A missed opportunity
These choices, as personal as they may look from afar, have significant economic implications for Pakistan, the key amongst them being the declining female labour force participation (FLPR) in the country, which currently stands at a meagre 24pc — the lowest in South Asia. The FLPR in Bangladesh stands at 44pc, while in India it is 33pc.
Among women who continue to work, only 16pc are formally employed; the rest, in the informal sector, have no maternity protection.
According to data compiled by the World Bank, industry employs 15pc of women, while 19pc work in services of the employed women; the remaining 66pc are employed in the agriculture sector.
This gap between women’s participation in the workforce and the growth of industries and services is a missed opportunity for economic expansion.
What is vs what should be
Over the past two decades, Pakistan has made legislative strides when it comes to breastfeeding rights. Case in point: The Protection of Breast-feeding and Child Nutrition Ordinance, 2002, which set the foundation for protecting breastfeeding mothers and regulating the marketing of breast milk substitutes.
Legislation at the provincial level — the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Protection of Breast-Feeding and Child Nutrition Act (2015), the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Breastfeeding and Child Nutrition Bill (2014), and the most recent Sindh Protection and Promotion of Breast-Feeding and Young Child Nutrition Act (2023) — has also expanded these protections.
The law in Sindh mandates the establishment of an Infant and Young Child Nutrition Board, bans aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes, restricts their sale to pharmacies with a doctor’s prescription, and prohibits public advertising for children up to 36 months. It is aligned with recommendations by the World Health Organisation and Unicef.
 
 

Yet, business councils have challenged the restrictions, and enforcement remains uncertain.
Maternity leave is now enshrined in the Maternity and Paternity Leave Act (2023), which grants maternity and paternity leave to working parents. However, the reality is that many private employers either ignore the law or circumvent it by keeping women on short-term contracts.
Even in regulated urban sectors like banks and financial institutions, such arrangements for women employees are often absent. On the other hand, for women employed in the informal sector, these legal protections are almost meaningless without efficient enforcement mechanisms.
While initiatives such as the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) are proven to improve breastfeeding outcomes worldwide, Pakistan has yet to integrate these standards into its hospital accreditation system. Some facilities have partially implemented these standards, but nationwide scaling — and embedding compliance into hospital licensing — would ensure early initiation of breastfeeding, rooming-in, and elimination of pre-lacteal feeds.
Bridging the gap
What is equally critical is community-level support.
Lady health workers (LHWs), midwives, and peer counsellors are trusted channels for providing breastfeeding counselling. Yet, no structured, nationwide home-based breastfeeding support programme has been documented.
Flexible clinic hours and mobile health teams could bridge the gap for breastfeeding mothers.
The Mamta programme in Sindh is one such initiative that offers a promising model. Designed to provide conditional cash transfers to over 1.3 million pregnant and lactating women over five years, it links financial incentives to antenatal visits, institutional deliveries, and breastfeeding practices.
By addressing both economic and health barriers, such programmes can improve outcomes, but only if coupled with nutrition education, micronutrient supplements, and consistent supply chains.
But beyond policy gaps, it is the cultural attitudes toward breastfeeding that pose a big challenge. Taboos against breastfeeding in public or at work discourage women from continuing their jobs once they return to employment.
“I attend classes with my newborn at home,“ said a PhD student. “I can barely concentrate during the lectures because my mind is on whether my baby has been fed or not. I feel like I am compromising her health for my education.”
The stakes are high
Moreover, during emergencies such as floods, ensuring safe breastfeeding is critical to child survival, yet disaster response plans often fail to include infant and young child feeding (IYCF) protocols. Shelters in flood-affected areas often breach women’s privacy, forcing them to breastfeed in crowded, exposed spaces, which causes mental strain and, for some, leads to early cessation.
Mother-baby friendly spaces in shelters, staffed by trained responders, are therefore essential for protecting breastfeeding moms during disasters.
 
 

National nutrition assessments often lump women and children into broad categories, overlooking the specific barriers faced by women in paid employment. This lack of disaggregated data means that nutrition policies rarely address structural constraints such as workplace inflexibility, lack of childcare, and mobility restrictions.
Collecting and analysing breastfeeding data by employment status, maternal education, and service access could enable more targeted interventions. Budget allocations for infant and young child feeding programmes remain insufficient, particularly in high-burden provinces such as Sindh and Balochistan. Protecting and increasing these budgets through child-responsive budgeting could ensure sustained investment in early childhood nutrition.
There is a need for realisation that breastfeeding must be treated as a workplace right, not a privilege. This means enforcing maternity leave in line with standards outlined by the International Labour Organisation, mandating functional breastfeeding spaces, integrating maternal and child health into labour inspections, and educating employers on the economic returns of supporting working mothers.
For Pakistan, the stakes are high. Failing to support breastfeeding not only compromises child health and development but also limits women’s economic participation and perpetuates gender inequality.

A senior officer of investigation police said Shahrez Khan, son of Aleema Khan, was wanted in the 2023 violence which erupted following the arrest of Imran Khan.
Rejecting police claim, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said Shahrez had nothing to do with politics.
Shahrez’ father Suhail Khan said his son was doing business and now he was preparing to go abroad to participate in a world triathlon championship. Earlier, Salman Raja said plainclothes men attacked the residence of Aleema Khan and abducted her son Shahrez.
“Aleema Bibi’s home in Lahore has been attacked by men in plainclothes and her son Shahrez abducted,” tweeted Mr Raja.
 






He also alleged that the intruders harassed Aleema Khan’s family members and even thrashed staff.
PTI lawyer Rana Mudassar told Dawn.com that Shahrez was “kidnapped” from his home in Lahore.
“People dressed in plainclothes entered the house and took Aleema Khan’s son with them,” he claimed. “No case has been registered against Shahrez, nor is he related to politics.”
Mudassar said no information had been given about Shahrez’s whereabouts and that he would approach the Lahore High Court for his recovery.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram wrote on X: “During an attack, people dressed in plainclothes abducted the son of Aleema Khan from her home.
 






“We strongly condemn this thuggery and oppression. We demand from the current government and the Chief Justice that her son be immediately recovered and safely returned to her,” he added.
At night, Salman Raja reached the residence of Aleema Khan and told media the men in civvies came in tinted glass vehicles and drove away Shahrez Khan without presenting any warrant. Raja said the “powers that be” were busy in victimising Imran Khan and added Shahrez Khan had nothing to do with politics.
Advocate Hassan Niazi, another nephew of Imran Khan, was convicted in a May 9 case in December last.

The limit — which will be recommended for all residents in central Japan’s Toyoake City — will not be binding and there will be no penalties incurred for higher usage, according to the draft ordinance.
The proposal aims “to prevent excessive use of devices causing physical and mental health issues… including sleep problems”, mayor Masafumi Koki said in a statement on Friday.
The draft urges elementary school students to avoid smartphones after 9:00pm, and junior high students and older are advised not to use them after 10:00pm.
The move prompted an online backlash, with many calling the plan unrealistic.
“I understand their intention, but the two-hour limit is impossible,” one user wrote on social media platform X.
“In two hours, I cannot even read a book or watch a movie (on my smartphone),” wrote another.
Others said smartphone use should be a decision for families to make themselves.
The angry response prompted the mayor to clarify that the two-hour limit was not mandatory, emphasising that the guidelines “acknowledge smartphones are useful and indipensable in daily life”.
 
 

The ordinance will be considered next week, and if passed, it will come into effect in October.
In 2020, the western Kagawa region issued a first-of-its kind ordinance calling for children to be limited to an hour a day of gaming during the week, and 90 minutes during school holidays.
It also suggested children aged 12 to 15 should not be allowed to use smartphones later than 9:00pm, with the limit rising to 10:00pm for children between 15 and 18.
Japanese youth spend slightly over five hours on average a day online on weekdays, according to a survey published in March by the Children and Families Agency.</p><small>2025-08-22 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/220945124d41609.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933615/chinas-foreign-minister-wang-coas-munir-discuss-regional-security-and-counter-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Foreign Minister Wang, COAS Munir discuss regional security and counter-terrorism</strong></a><br><p>China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a meeting with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir in Islamabad during his official visit to the country, discussing regional security and counter-terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The Chinese foreign minister arrived in Pakistan late Wednesday night to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue on Thursday morning. He also met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirming China’s commitment to working with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability.
Wang—who had earlier met his Afghan counterpart in Kabul on Wednesday—said that China was prepared to support its neighbours on issues concerning their core interests and to firmly oppose external interference in the region, per a Chinese foreign ministry handout. He stressed the need to improve the security dialogue mechanism, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, strengthen the fight against transnational terrorism, and eliminate conditions that promote extremism.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, Wang and COAS Munir held discussions focused on regional security, counter-terrorism and matters of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the strategic partnership and enhance coordination at regional and international forums.”
Wang reiterated China’s steadfast support for Pakistan’s sovereignty and development, the statement said, adding that COAS Munir expressed gratitude for China’s consistent support for Pakistan.
The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to advance peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, it said.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership that covers trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. Their militaries have built deep mutual trust and cooperation, and both sides agreed to sustain high-level visits while enhancing collaboration in joint training, exercises and military technology.
On August 1, COAS Munir, while speaking at an event marking the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Islamabad and Beijing will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Last month, during COAS Munir’s visit to Beijing, the Chinese leadership had lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.

Islamabad hopes the project will serve as a springboard to draw more foreign interest to its mineral sector, particularly to exploit rare earth deposits. Pakistan has already attracted interest from the Trump administration and offered future concessions to US companies.
The loans and a financing guarantee will support development of Reko Diq, which is expected to produce copper and gold from 2028 and generate about $70 billion in free cash flow over its lifespan.
The financing is composed of two loans totalling $300m to Barrick and a $110m financing guarantee for the Government of Pakistan, both sources said ahead of the official announcement.
The $6.6bn project in Balochistan is 50pc owned by Barrick with the other half held by the federal and provincial governments.
ADB, the petroleum ministry and Barrick did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The project aims to raise upwards of $2bn and has a previous agreement for $700m in financing from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private investment arm.
The project’s developers are in talks with other prospective financiers, including the US Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and Japans JBIC and expect to sign term sheets this quarter, project director Tim Cribb told Reuters in April.

A PDMA report issued here said that the tally of deaths from last Friday’s catastrophic rains and flash floods had gone up to 393, with Buner, the most affected district, reporting 234 fatalities as well as injury to 128 people.
Also, 42 people were killed and 20 injured in Swabi district, while Shangla district has recorded 36 deaths, Mansehra 25, Bajaur 22 and Swat 20.
 
 

The PDMA report said that the Pakistan Meteorological Department had forecast the start of widespread rains in the province’s central and upper parts from August 22.

Most 234 fatalities reported in Buner district

It said that widespread downpour, along with wind and thunderstorms, were very likely in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Malakand, Buner, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Abbottabad, Haripur, Swabi, Mardan, Nowshera, Charsadda, Peshawar, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan from August 22 to 26.
The PDMA warned that heavy to very heavy rainfall could generate flash floods in nullah and streams of Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Abbottabad, Buner, Bajaur, Battagram, Buner, Hangu, Torghar, Haripur, Karak, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Khyber, Kohat, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Shangla, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Waziristan and Tank district during the period.
It also issued a warning about flooding in low-lying urban areas of Peshawar, Nowshera, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts and said that landslides could cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of Abbottabad, Battagram, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Khyber, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Kohistan, Kurram, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Shangla, Swat, Torghar and North Waziristan districts.
In addition, heavy rainfall along with windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like the roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
The PDMA asked authorities to take all precautionary measures to avoid or minimise damage to public life and property, cattle and infrastructure.
It urged local administrations to plan provision of additional resources and exercise control over traffic leading to and in vicinity of vulnerable choke points and tourist places and keep people away from structures under construction, advertisement hoardings, electric poles and solar panels.
The PDMA also called for the removal of debris and obstacles from drainage systems to ensure efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding, and coordinate with the relevant municipal administrations to ensure mitigation and preparedness measures for landslides and urban flooding.
It also emphasised the removal of billboards and hoardings to prevent damage to public life and property due to wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It asked people to seek shelter in sturdy buildings or underground structures to prevent damage from wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms, or lightning.

• Exposes recurring systemic issues in federal govt finances
• Massive supplementary grants allocated without parliamentary approval
• 87pc of expenditure in FY24 on debt, interest payments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has identified a record over Rs375 trillion worth of irregularities, financial mismanagement and loss of public money in the affairs of the federal government and departments and entities working under its control.
The AGP expressed grave concern that only 13 per cent of public funds were directed towards the public good, raising significant questions about the country’s financial affairs.
In its report for the audit year 2024-25, the AGP examined the accounts of the federal government, including ministries, divisions and other government bodies, for FY24. The report said that the “recurrence of these irregularities indicates that systemic issues were cropping up either due to inadequate oversight mechanisms or inappropriate design of internal controls”.
It pointed out unnecessary allocation of supplementary grants leading to blocking of public funds, massive supplementary grants without approval of the parliament, demand for budget without need assessment leading to surrender of budget, lapse of funds due to non-surrendering of funds in time and non-recording of commitments leading to poor budget management.
It said that “a high percentage of expenditure, i.e. 96.26pc, was expended on General Public Service, which includes 86.69pc on repayment of debt and interest payments during 2023-24, which was 91.42pc during 2022-23”.
Therefore, the federal government was left with a meagre 13.31pc of total expenditure for socio-economic functions (other than debt), which is slightly higher than the last year‘s percentage of 8.58pc.
Some of the key audit findings included a massive Rs284.17tr procurement-related issues, Rs85.6tr worth of defective, unexecuted and delayed civil work and Rs2.5tr worth of receivables and recovery-related issues.
There were Rs1.228tr worth of non-settlement of circular debt issues, Rs958bn worth of violation of law and regulations, Rs677.5bn of weak internal control, Rs628bn of poor asset management and Rs281bn worth of poor contract management.
There were Rs165bn worth of audit findings relating to miscellaneous financial issues, Rs73bn worth of value for money and service delivery issues and Rs92bn worth of loss to the state due to non-recovery of government shares and encroachment on public land.
 
 

The report noted that although many government entities had internal audit setups, the financial irregularities observed during the current audit reflect that this function failed to deliver effectively. “The efficient functioning of internal audit would have helped the management in effective implementation of internal controls and strengthening the internal control environment in audited entities,” it observed.
The audit analysis revealed certain deficiencies and shortcomings that were shared with the management and all the stakeholders, which include the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue (AGPR), Cont­roller General of Accounts (CGA), Ministry of Finance and all principal accounting officers of the relevant ministries and divisions and other entities for corrective measures.
The report revealed that 29pc (Rs513.87bn) of supplementary grants for FY24 had been issued without parliamentary approval, an unauthorised action. Non-surrender of savings under 12 grants led to a lapse of Rs212.08bn, and Rs12.6bn worth of expenditure exceeded the approved grants.
It said that as per the appropriation accounts for the financial year 2023-24, there was a total provision of Rs46.57tr. However, after surrender and supplementary grants, the final allocation was Rs 40.315tr. The actual expenditure was Rs39.945tr, with Rs369.97bn (0.92pc) savings, which was lower than the final allocation.
Overall appropriation figures revealed that the federal government approved supplementary grants of Rs1.765tr, of which Rs513.87bn was not approved by parliament. It said the Ministry of Finance claimed that supplementary grants not approved by parliament during the year would be presented for regularisation at the time of the next budget.
The AGP is required under Articles 169 and 170 of the Constitution to conduct an audit of the accounts of federal and provincial governments and the accounts of any authority or body established by these governments.
The consolidated audit report of the federal government is based on audits of the accounts of 7,879 formations working under entities of the federal government for the financial year 2023-24, and also contains some audit observations for the previous years.
The audit was conducted during 2024-25 on a test check basis to report significant audit findings to the stakeholders. The report includes only the systemic issues and audit findings carrying high monetary value.
Relatively less significant issues shall be pursued with the respective principal accounting officers (PAO) and, if unresolved, have to be brought to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee in the next year‘s audit report.
The AGP claimed that its audit activities had contributed towards adding value to the control mechanism of organisations, which complied with audit recommendations. As a result of the audit, management‘s awareness about internal controls and overall financial discipline has improved compliance with rules and regulations.

KOT ADDU: Villagers carrying their children on their shoulders wade through floodwaters in Ehsan Pur village.—AFP

• Fresh spell of torrential rains forecast across the country
• PDMA issues high-alert warning for Punjab
• Tarbela Dam is at maximum capacity; Mangla Dam is 74pc full
LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Thousands of families in south Punjab have been displaced as floods caused by overflowing Indus and Chenab rivers have destroyed homes, crops and farmland.
Districts including Layyah, Taunsa Sharif, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Multan are among the worst affected.
In Multan, floodwaters entered several villages, destroying crops and mango orchards. In Kot Adu, residents of Ehsanpur and Hinjrai union councils were forced to evac­uate along with their livestock.
“Houses are surrounded by water, crops have vanished and land is eroding,” a rescue official told Dawn on condition of anonymity, adding that his team had evacuated over 150 people and their cattle by boat.
In Layyah, floodwaters washed away roads connected to the Layyah-Taunsa bridge, breaching the protective bunds. Residents of multiple union councils in Layyah and Taunsa have fled their homes, many now living under the open sky. At Head Taunsa, water flows have reached 500,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs), threatening downstream areas of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
 
 

Jampur tehsil has also been devastated, with villages such as Shero Jadu, Jakhar Imam Shah, Lundi Pitafi and Qabool Chowk submerged. Residents said they lost homes and crops without receiving any government assistance. “We have to leave on our own with our cattle,” said Khalil Malik, a resident of Jampur.
In Muzaffargarh, floodwaters breached locally built bunds in Jatoi and Alipur tehsils, forcing residents to evacuate. Entire villages near Khairpur, Basti Laskani and Kehal have been abandoned.
Fresh spell of rains
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast another spell of heavy monsoon rains from Aug 23, warning of torrential downpours, wind and thunderstorms in the upper and central parts of the country until Aug 27, followed by heavy rains in Sindh and eastern and southern Balochistan from Aug 27 to 29.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are expected to penetrate the country’s upper regions from Aug 22, with a westerly wave likely to approach the same night.
Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Azad Kashmir (Neelum valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and rain, wind and thundershowers (with isolated heavy falls) in Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from Aug 23 to Aug 27 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan from Aug 23 to 26.
Similar weather is expected in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Aug 23 to 27 with occasional gaps.
 
 

Scattered rain, wind and thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) are also likely in D.G. Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan from Aug 24 to Aug 27.
In Sindh, rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas from the evening or night of Aug 23 to Aug 26 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, similar weather is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Zhob, Kalat and Khuzdar from Aug 23 (evening or night) to Aug 26.
The PMD has warned of flash floods in streams and nullahs of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northern Punjab, Islamabad, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir between Aug 23 and 26. Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan. Landslides and mudslides are also feared in hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree and Kashmir.
The Met Office has urged authorities to remain on high alert and advised citizens, tourists and travellers to avoid unnecessary exposure in vulnerable areas. It warned that strong winds, heavy falls and lightning may damage weak structures, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
PDMA issues high alert
Separately, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a high-alert warning across the province as increased water flows, fuelled by glacial melt and ongoing rains, threaten several districts.
According to the PDMA, medium-level flooding is reported at Taunsa Barrage on the Indus, while Chashma and Kalabagh are experiencing low-level flooding. On the Sutlej River, Ganda Singh Wala and Bed Sulemanki are under low-level flood stage, with the Pulkhu and Basantar streams also affected.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Tarbela Dam has reached 100 per cent capacity and Mangla Dam is 74pc full, raising concerns of further water releases into already swollen rivers.
“Citizens living in riverbeds should immediately relocate to safe areas,” DG Kathia warned, urging people to comply with evacuation orders and avoid recreational activities near rivers. He stressed that bathing in rivers, canals and ponds is strictly prohibited and parents must not allow children near water bodies.
While water flows in the Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi rivers remain normal, the PDMA cautioned that the situation could worsen rapidly. “Protecting lives and property is our paramount responsibility,” DG Kathia said, calling for vigilance and immediate action from communities in at-risk areas.

The exchange of fire took place near Karmazi Stop, as troops were carrying out an operation to take control of a key militant stronghold. Sources said security forces managed to establish two new posts in the area.
Officials said that several militants initially managed to take refuge inside a nearby structure, but later fled during the clearance operation.
The crossfire left 11 residents injured, who were provided first aid before being shifted to the District Headq­uarters Hospital in Wana.
 
 

Witnesses said intermittent firing continued throughout the day, and residents said the area remained tense throughout the operation, with families confined to their homes for several hours. The Wana-Azam Warsak Road remained closed until around 1pm, disrupting routine life and leaving thousands unable to reach Wana Rustam bazaar.

Several militants believed to be among those killed in Bajaur explosion

Security officials confirmed that the road was later cleared.
Separately, several people were killed an explosion in the remote Charmang region of Bajaur’s Nawagai tehsil.
Although the exact cause of the incident is yet to be established, some sources claimed that a number of militants were among those killed. By some accounts, over two dozen individuals were killed in the explosion, which occurred in a mosque located in a hilly area. The remoteness of the region made it difficult to obtain independent confirmation of the incident.
It may be recalled that Operation Sarbakaf is currently underway in Bajaur, and residents have been evacuated from parts of the district as security forces work to root out a militant presence in the area.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, on either incident, until going to press.

Things didn’t come easy for him as a player, he says. And he doesn’t expect them to be any better for him as coach. That’s what has brought the Peruvian former Newcastle United cult hero to football’s backwaters in Pakistan.
The sport in the country has seen little progress due to a decade-long institutional crisis in the Pakistan Football Federation. There have been some highs, notably Pakistan’s historic victory over Cambodia in 2023 — the first time the national team won a FIFA World Cup qualifier — but otherwise, it’s been a tale of woe compounded by a non-existent domestic structure.
Stephen Constantine, Solano’s predecessor who guided Pakistan to that famous victory over Cambodia, departed under a cloud; the newly-elected PFF leadership under president Mohsen Gilani having opted to look for other options. Enter the 50-year-old Solano, whose breathtaking skill on the wing made him a fan favourite at Newcastle but who still has a lot to prove as a coach.
None of his stints as head coach since leaving the job as Peru’s assistant coach, where he notably oversaw his nation qualify for their first World Cup in 36 years, has lasted more than a year. The Pakistan job offers him a chance to reset but he believes that any success will have a lot of contributing factors.
“My journey hasn’t been easy at any time,” Solano told Dawn in an exclusive interview just before he was unveiled to the media here at the PFF headquarters on Thursday. “And it won’t be easy here too.”
Solano recalled how he first broke into the consciousness of his first club side Sporting Cristal through a trial arranged by his father, who became a taxi driver after leaving the Peruvian army.
“I had to work very hard to impress at the trial,” said Solano. “In Peru, there is fierce competition for places … Everyone there loves football. Everyone there wants to be a footballer.”
Sparkling performances for Cristal saw Solano earn a move to Argentine giants Boca Juniors where he played with the legendary Diego Maradona. Only a year later, he had English Premier League clubs hovering over him and at a time when South American players preferred to go to Spain or Italy, he opted to take a path less trodden when he opted to sign for Newcastle in 1998.
“During that time, Spain or Italy was the easier option because there was no language barrier,” reflected Solano, who not only took upon himself to learn a new language and culture but also adjust to a different playing style with English football being more physical.
“The spell at Boca somewhat made it easier [to make the transition] because it is very similar,” said Solano. “But it was a test, and I wanted to test myself because [forward] Faustino Asprillia, who was Colombian, had a successful spell at Newcastle.”
He didn’t disappoint. Arriving after Asprilla had joined Parma, Solano became a first-team regular at Newcastle with not only his playing ability but also his personality making him a fan favourite.  But major silverware eluded both Newcastle and Solano, who also had spells at Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leicester City and Hull City in England before retiring.
Solano’s biggest regret, though, remains that he was unable to help Peru qualify for the World Cup as a player but some consolation came when he helped his country end that long drought in Russia 2018.
“It was a big achievement for the whole country as a whole to get to the World Cup after such a long time,” said Solano. “[Head coach] Ricardo Gareca did a wonderful job in unifying the team and we were able to do that. I think the lack of discipline was one of the reasons my generation was unable to qualify for the World Cup.”
Targets and expectations, though, are more modest with Pakistan.  But Solano is keen on not only bringing the South American flair but also grit and determination, and the fighting spirit, to the national and Under-23 teams. Many players, the local-based ones in particular, have had to do without any kind of domestic action. But in his first few training sessions, he has seen that the talent is promising.
“I’ve seen some really talented players who have had to make do without domestic football,” he said. “That [domestic football] is something  we need to collectively work on: me, the PFF and its leadership. But the big thing is that they’re willing to fight for a spot on the national team.
“It is something I’ve told the diaspora players I’ve spoken to since I took over. I’ve told them that they have to try and make their presence felt at the training camps because those who are here are willing to give everything to make the team.”
For a man who has fought so many battles himself, Solano is counting on that desire to lift Pakistan football.

Enter the 50-year-old Solano, whose breathtaking skill on the wing made him a fan favourite at Newcastle but who still has a lot to prove as a coach.
None of his stints as head coach since leaving the job as Peru’s assistant coach, where he notably oversaw his nation qualify for their first World Cup in 36 years, has lasted more than a year. The Pakistan job offers him a chance to reset but he believes that any success will have a lot of contributing factors.
“My journey hasn’t been easy at any time,” Solano told Dawn in an exclusive interview just before he was unveiled to the media here at the PFF headquarters on Thursday. “And it won’t be easy here too.”
Solano recalled how he first broke into the consciousness of his first club side Sporting Cristal through a trial arranged by his father, who became a taxi driver after leaving the Peruvian army.
“I had to work very hard to impress at the trial,” said Solano. “In Peru, there is fierce competition for places … Everyone there loves football. Everyone there wants to be a footballer.”
Sparkling performances for Cristal saw Solano earn a move to Argentine giants Boca Juniors where he played with the legendary Diego Maradona. Only a year later, he had English Premier League clubs hovering over him and at a time when South American players preferred to go to Spain or Italy, he opted to take a path less trodden when he opted to sign for Newcastle in 1998.
“During that time, Spain or Italy was the easier option because there was no language barrier,” reflected Solano, who not only took upon himself to learn a new language and culture but also adjust to a different playing style with English football being more physical.
“The spell at Boca somewhat made it easier [to make the transition] because it is very similar,” said Solano. “But it was a test, and I wanted to test myself because [forward] Faustino Asprillia, who was Colombian, had a successful spell at Newcastle.”
He didn’t disappoint. Arriving after Asprilla had joined Parma, Solano became a first-team regular at Newcastle with not only his playing ability but also his personality making him a fan favourite.  But major silverware eluded both Newcastle and Solano, who also had spells at Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leicester City and Hull City in England before retiring.
Solano’s biggest regret, though, remains that he was unable to help Peru qualify for the World Cup as a player but some consolation came when he helped his country end that long drought in Russia 2018.
“It was a big achievement for the whole country as a whole to get to the World Cup after such a long time,” said Solano. “[Head coach] Ricardo Gareca did a wonderful job in unifying the team and we were able to do that. I think the lack of discipline was one of the reasons my generation was unable to qualify for the World Cup.”
Targets and expectations, though, are more modest with Pakistan.  But Solano is keen on not only bringing the South American flair but also grit and determination, and the fighting spirit, to the national and Under-23 teams. Many players, the local-based ones in particular, have had to do without any kind of domestic action. But in his first few training sessions, he has seen that the talent is promising.
“I’ve seen some really talented players who have had to make do without domestic football,” he said. “That [domestic football] is something  we need to collectively work on: me, the PFF and its leadership. But the big thing is that they’re willing to fight for a spot on the national team.
“It is something I’ve told the diaspora players I’ve spoken to since I took over. I’ve told them that they have to try and make their presence felt at the training camps because those who are here are willing to give everything to make the team.”
For a man who has fought so many battles himself, Solano is counting on that desire to lift Pakistan football.

Explaining the unexpected change in weather over the past two days, Focal Person of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Anjum Niaz Zaigham said the current monsoon system has lost its intensity and its likely impact on Karachi is almost over.
“Though as we speak, the city is likely to see good showers within an hour or so (late evening) as rain bands are approaching Karachi after bringing about showers in Hyderabad, Sanghar, Tando Allah Yar and other parts of Sindh,” he said.
He said that Orangi Town saw 113mm rain on Wednesday.

Light to moderate showers continue for third day

According to him, the weather system released its maximum energy on August 19 and the circulation over Gujarat, India dissipated early than expected.
“We were thinking that the low pressure area and the circulation over Gujarat would combine together but that didn’t happen, fortunately. Even, then, we wanted to remain cautious as it’s difficult to predict the system’s behaviour with complete accuracy,” he said.
Karachi, he pointed out, is expected to have its next monsoon spell on Aug 27, though the ongoing system is likely to impact south-east parts of the province on Friday (today).
Meanwhile, the Met department in an advisory has forecast mostly cloudy weather with slight chances of light rain / drizzle over the next two days (Friday-Thursday) in Karachi with maximum temperature ranging between 32 and 34 degrees Celsius.
According to the PMD’s 24-hour rain data of Aug 20, the maximum rain was recorded in Orangi town 113mm followed by PAF Faisal Base 43mm, Korangi 36mm, Keamari 31mm, PAF Base Masroor and University Road 24mm each, DHA 21mm, Nizamabad 19mm, Saadi twon 16mm and North Karachi 9mm.
Man dies of electrocution
A young man died of electrocution in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 15 in three days of rain.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the Sahir Qamar, 30, was brought dead from DHA to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre on Thursday. He died of an electric shock, she said.
Officials said that most deaths were caused by falling house structures and electrocution.
‘Situation fully under control’
While the city administration is struggling to drain rainwater accumulated in many underpasses and roads, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi claimed that rainwater had been cleared from most markets in the city and adjoining roads had been reopened for traffic.
He stated in a statement that the drainage work at Nazimabad and Tariq Road underpasses had been completed and both reopened for vehicular traffic. Similarly, water accumulated at NIPA had been removed and the road restored for traffic flow. Work is continuing at Drigh Road, Sohrab Goth, and Gulbahar underpasses, where pumps have been installed and are operational. The Commissioner said these underpasses will be cleared soon, he added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani also paid a visit to the city and told the media that the overall situation in Karachi remained fully under control.
He said that despite the continuing showers, municipal staff, civil administration, elected representatives and provincial ministers are all present on the ground to supervise relief efforts. He added that after clearing major roads, drainage work on link roads and residential streets has been expedited.
He appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the downpour to prevent any untoward incidents.

The Islamic Relief’s emergency response team is on the ground distributing food and water, and the team’s assessment found that 73 per cent of houses are destroyed or partially damaged; sixty per cent of people in Buner and 53 per cent in Swat are now unable to support their families; eighty per cent of agricultural land in Buner has been damaged; nearly 50 per cent of livestock animals have died and been washed away.
 
 

According to the assessment, 40 per cent of households are already reporting cases of diarrhea, with water-borne diseases spreading as the water supply is contaminated by bodies of victims and livestock and the destruction of sanitation facilities.
Acting country director of Islamic Relief Pakistan, Raza Narejo, said that “now the flood waters are receding, but the impact is enormous and it will affect people here for a long time. The poorest communities have seen their jobs and income wiped out in a flash, with 60 per cent of workers in Buner district now unable to sustain themselves following the floods.“

The restriction was initially imposed on April 24 this year amid ongoing tensions between the two countries. It was first extended on May 23, followed by further extensions up to July 23, and then until August 24.
Sources confirmed that the Pakistan Airport Aut­h­ority had previously exte­nded the airspace closure for Indian aircraft from July 18 to August 24. Now, ac­cording to the latest NOTAM, the Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian aircraft from Aug 25 until Sept 25.
The ban applies specifically to Indian-registered or leased aircraft, whether op­­erated, owned, or leased by Indian operators, including military fli­ghts, as per NOTAM A0472/25 issued by the authorities con­­cerned. However, Pak­is­tan’s airspace remains open to all other international flights, it said.

The audit report also indicated there was significant public dissatisfaction with the performance of the NDMA in terms of its awareness campaigns, preparedness, and relief efforts.
This observation was made after the Directorate General Audit (Cli­mate Change and Environm­ent) conducted an audit of the NDMA Islamabad.
A public questionnaire was used to gather opinions on their effectiveness.
A significant portion of participants had limited, or to some extent, awareness about natural disasters (72 per cent combined), while the awareness of NDMA as an agency was also limited (72pc) had knowledge to some extent.

Auditors raise Rs28bn objections; authority accused of overpaying firms for Karachi drains project

Overall, 76pc disagreed or were neutral when asked if the NDMA prepared communities for potential disaster or not; only 36pc agreed.
A majority (76pc) was dissatisfied or neutral regarding the speed of relief efforts by the NDMA, with only 24pc expressing satisfaction. Satisfaction with overall performance ratings was also low, with 84pc dissatisfied or neutral. Only 16pc were satisfied.
The auditor general pointed out in the report that an unauthorised expenditure out of the National Di­­saster Management Fund (NDMF) was carried out in 2023-24.
The NDMA incurred an expenditure of Rs21.677 billion out of the National Disaster Management Fund Account on the procurement of relief items, civil works of the National Emergency Operation Center building, project employee salaries, and civil works on the the Karachi Transformation Plan (KTP), including the reconstruction and revamping of major nullahs in the port city during the financial year 2023-24.
“The audit held that expenditure out of the National Disaster Manag­ement Fund Account without ap­­pr­oved and notified national authority by the federal government stood unauthorised,” said the report.
Similarly, it pointed out overpayment on account of escalation to the National Logistics Cell (NLC) for Orangi Nullah worth Rs2.437 billion. During the audit for the financial year 2023-24, it was ob­­served that an amount of Rs3.267 billion was paid to the NLC on account of escalation for the Orangi Nullah work, leading to the overpayment of Rs2.437 billion.
The audit recommended that the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs2.437 billion may be made from the NLC and be deposited into the public exchequer. It also recommended the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs1.839 billion from the NLC.
Similarly, the audit report highlighted unauthorised expenditure out of the NDM Fund on event management services worth Rs23.254 million, overpriced award of contracts to the state-owned entities on account of Gujjar and Orangi nullah works, amounting to Rs5.674 billion, and the “mis-procurement of family tents on pre-qualification basis instead of open competitive bidding” causing a loss of Rs4.829 billion.
According to the audit report, the procurement of the tents without a technical evaluation also caused a further loss of Rs2.58 billion. The audit held that procurement of winterised and shelter tents from the suppliers was a violation of PPRA Rules. The audit recommended that the matter be inquired into and responsibility be fixed over the violation of the PPRA Rules.

“The State Department revokes visas any time there are indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organisation,” the official said.
In a written comment to The Associated Press, the official said that if a visa holder presents these indications, their visa will be revoked and they will be subject to deportation if they are already in the US.
US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a focus of his presidency, boosting resources to secure the border and arresting people in the country illegally.
Earlier this month, the US government announced that it could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme to crack down on visitors who overstay their visas.
The programme gives US consular officers the discretion to impose bonds on visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays, according to a Federal Register notice, which adds that bonds could also be applied to people coming from countries where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient.
In July, US broadcaster CNN reported that the US would soon require international visitors to pay a “visa integrity fee” of at least $250, a new addition to existing visa application costs, according to a provision in the Trump administration’s domestic policy bill.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
In June, United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said a US diplomatic cable.</p><small>2025-08-21 19:38</small></div><hr>
