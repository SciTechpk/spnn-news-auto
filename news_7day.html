• SBCA has declared 588 buildings ‘dangerous’ in Karachi
• 55 people have died in four major structural collapses over past five years in Lyari alone
• Govt prepared to relocate occupants of dangerous buildings, says Saeed Ghani
KARACHI: As yet another building crumbled into dust in Lyari on Friday killing at least 10 people, the shadow of a far greater disaster looms over the city, as the fallen structure was one of 588 buildings officially declared dangerous by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
A total of 107 of the “dangerous” buildings are concentrated in Lyari alone, making the latest tragedy less of a shock and more of a grim inevitability.
The building, now reduced to rubble, was no stranger to danger. In fact, the officials and sources said, it was already marked and catalogued as one of the 107 “dangerous structures” in Lyari, as per SBCA’s records.
Across the city, the SBCA admits that 588 buildings are too dangerous for human habitation.
The SBCA claims to have done its job — letters sent, notices served, warnings issued. But, these actions ring hollow when evacuation orders are neither enforced nor accompanied by viable relocation options for already vulnerable residents. Most of these residents are daily wage earners and low-income families with nowhere else to go.
“We can’t forcefully evacuate without the cooperation of local law enforcement and social welfare bodies. People simply don’t leave,” said an SBCA official.
But the reality is far grimmer. Jawad Shoaib, a Lyariite and area councillor, says the authorities are more focused on “illegal constructions” in the area and had least interest in making serious plans for the relocation of the residents of these dangerous buildings.
“If you’re told to vacate but have no money, no plan, and no help — what do you do? Wait to die, or risk staying?” he asked.

This is not the first time Lyari has mourned like this. Over the past five years, at least four major buildings have collapsed in this historic but long-neglected district. In 2020, three such incidents left 49 people dead.
In March 2020, a single-storey house collapsed after torrential rains — two lives lost, five injured.
Just three months later, June 2020, a five-storey structure crumbled, killing 22 people. Later that month, another building fell in Khudadad Market, Lyari, claiming 25 more lives. And now, in July 2025, eight more names are added to a growing list of fatalities.
That’s 55 deaths in five years — all linked to crumbling, unsafe buildings in the same area.
The question hanging in the dusty Karachi air: If these buildings were already declared dangerous, why were people still living in them?
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani sees it as a real challenge.
Talking to the media after reviewing the ongoing rescue operations at the site of the collapsed building near Aath Chowk in Baghdadi, he sought people’s support for such “sensitive job”.
“The real challenge arises when the government tries to forcibly evacuate residents from such buildings,” he said. “It becomes a humanitarian issue, and the authorities face criticism for displacing people from their homes. However, if the goal is to save innocent lives and avoid such disasters, strict action must be taken, even if it means removing people from their shelters.”
He said that after the recent tragedy, the people should think seriously about ensuring such incidents do not happen again anywhere in the city. “We may have to take away the roofs over people’s heads, but at least we will be able to save their lives,” he said.
 






Responding to a question about the “mafia of illegal builders” operating in the city, he claimed that the government had taken strict action against them, filed FIRs, and identified such builders. However, he stressed that unless citizens cooperate, this issue cannot be resolved.
“It’s a matter of demand. We want to eliminate this demand. If citizens stop purchasing homes in illegal buildings, the demand will cease,” he said and added that efforts are underway to cancel the feasibility of such illegal construction projects.
Later in the evening, he told a press conference that the provincial government was prepared to displace occupants of the city’s dilapidated buildings in order to save lives, and relocate them to alternative sites if necessary.

Speaking to BBC News, the contractor recalled one occasion when a guard had opened fire from a watchtower with a machine gun because a group of women, children and elderly people were moving away from the site too slowly.
Although the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has denied the allegations, claiming no civilians ever came under fire at their distribution sites, the BBC recorded 24 incidents where aid seekers were killed in large numbers.
The GHF began its operations at the end of May after an 11-week total blockade of Gaza by Israel, during which no food entered the territory.
Since it started, Israeli forces have killed more than 400 Palestinians trying to retrieve food aid from its sites, the UN and local doctors say.

Guards ‘fire into unarmed crowds, then laugh about it’

Describing the incident where guards fired on a group of Palestinians, the former contractor said: “As that happened, another contractor on location, standing on the berm overlooking the exit, opened up with 15 to 20 shots of repetitive weapons fire at the crowd.
“A Palestinian man dropped to the ground motionless. And then the other contractor who was standing there was like, ‘damn, I think you got one’. And then they laughed about it.”
The contractor, who spoke to us on condition of anonymity, said GHF managers had brushed off his report as a coincidence, suggesting that the Palestinian man could have “tripped” or been “tired and passed out”.
The GHF claims the man who made these allegations is a “disgruntled former contractor” who was terminated for misconduct, which he denies. He showed the BBC evidence that he left the post on good terms.
The contractor said he had worked at all four GHF distribution sites, and described a culture of impunity with few rules or controls.
He said contractors were given no clear rules of engagement or standard operating procedures, and were told by one team leader: “if you feel threatened, shoot – shoot to kill and ask questions later”.
 
 

The culture in the company, he said, felt like “we’re going into Gaza so it’s no rules. Do what you want.”
The contractor that each site had CCTV monitoring the activity in the area, and GHF insistence that no one there had been hurt or shot at was “an absolute bare-faced lie”.
Team leaders referred to Gazans as “zombie hordes”, the former contractor said, “insinuating that these people have no value.”
The man also said Palestinians were coming to harm in other ways at GHF sites, for example by being hit by debris from stun grenades, being sprayed with mace or being pushed by the crowds into razor wire.
He said he had witnessed several occasions in which Palestinians appeared to have been seriously hurt, including one man who had a full can of pepper spray in his face, and a woman who he said was hit with the metal part of a stun grenade, improperly fired into a crowd.

In the English language, the phrase ‘a rainy day’ means a probable time when money will be needed, unexpectedly. This may also suggest that while rain, in a certain way, has romantic and feel-good connotations, it can also bring with it a number of difficulties. The latter seems to be apt for Karachiites.
Every time — and it’s been happening for years now — it rains heavily in the city, citizens are found complaining about at least a few things: nerve-jangling traffic jams, damaged roads, sudden appearance of potholes and puddles, stagnant rainwater on roads and streets, and power failure.
 
 

Power failure, surely, in turn makes the availability of water supply a huge problem because in most localities in the city, water is pumped into pipes through machines run by electricity. Don’t the authorities concerned know that?
By authorities concerned one means the bodies responsible for managing Karachi: the provincial government, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, the cantonment board, etc.
Every year, during monsoons, a blame game starts which ends without a positive or permanent resolution to the issue. On June 27 and 28, heavy rains disrupted life in Karachi in a painful way. Despite the fact that June 28 was a Saturday, when a majority of the offices were closed, the snarl-up at thoroughfares such as Sharea Faisal was agonising. If one was in District South heading towards the airport, it took at least two hours to move from the Hotel Metropole roundabout to Drigh Road Railway Station.
As if it was an understandable consequence of Nature’s interference in Karachiites’ daily lives, there were reports of a prolonged power breakdown on June 28.

De-silting of major drains is yet to be completed by KMC

In DHA Phase V, for example, electricity went kaput in the afternoon and was restored at 4am. Similarly, quite a few blocks in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Federal B Area, North Nazimabad, suffered power shutdowns for up to 10 hours.
The worrisome thing is that the monsoon season has arrived early (as it usually begins in July). Have the authorities pre-empted the situation? One can’t be sure.
What adds to the worry is that at some places — for example, from Jail Road to Nipa — construction work has been going on for many a month. If rains come down heavily in July, these projects might get affected. No one knows how much money has so far been invested in the making of these yet-to-be-completed underpasses, overhead bridges and new roads. Whatever the amount may be, they need to be protected from uncalled-for interventions. Also, one hopes that construction work completes as soon as possible because it’s already a massive traffic issue.
 
 

It has to be said, though, that the one step that the KMC has taken,  in terms of preparing in advance for the rains, is that a few days back the corporation had begun the process of cleaning the stormwater drains in the city.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab himself witnessed the process during which he had said: “In addition to the 46 major drains, smaller drains are also being cleaned. A joint strategy will be employed to ensure the drainage of rainwater across all towns. As soon as the rains begin, staff, machinery and pumps will be dispatched to major roads. We  believe in working indiscriminately across all districts of Karachi and  will respond to critics through our work.”
It all sounds good. But, thus far, not all drains have been cleaned.
The clouds, as the month of July sets in, look ominous. There’s likelihood that citizens will soon be faced with a wet season. And if preventive measures are not taken in totality, Karachiites are in for a toilsome time.

Conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from Unicef and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, the survey also revealed that over half (50.4pc) of child  labour victims aged 10-17 worked in hazardous conditions, exposing them to  excessive hours, extreme weather and unsafe tools.
Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who is also the project director of the survey, told Dawn that the survey had been submitted to the provincial government.
He said that the incidence of child labour has seen a significant decline, reduced by nearly 50pc compared to the 1996 baseline.
 
 

According to Pakistan’s first and only National Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, the prevalence of child labour in Sindh was recorded at  20.6pc of the total child population at that time.
The latest survey also revealed that school attendance among working children is significantly lower (40.6pc) compared to non-working peers (70.5pc), with attendance declining steeply with age.
According to the survey, girls aged 14 to 17 years bear a heavier burden of household chores, averaging 13.9 hours per week and face higher school dropout rates.
The survey stated that child labour was strongly linked to poverty, with 33.7pc of the poorest households reporting at least one working child.
It stated that 20.1pc of children in child labour report symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate among children not in child labour.
The survey highlights significant variations in child labour rates across districts. Qambar Shahdadkot has the highest rate at 30.8pc, followed by Tharparkar (29pc), Shikarpur (20.2pc) and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3pc), while Karachi has the lowest rate at 2.38pc.

The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise will see elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Experts believe the outcome will hinge on how PTI-backed and JUI-F members vote. If the opposition remains united and PTI-backed members strictly follow party discipline — with JUI-F support — the ruling coalition may win only one general seat.
However, the scenario would shift dramatically if some PTI members break ranks and JUI-F strikes a deal with the ruling coalition. In that case, the coalition might bag around five seats, potentially gaining a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament. JUI-F already holds five seats in the Senate.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).
Polling for the 11 KP Senate seats will be held on July 21, while a separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.
According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats — originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.
The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat — vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir — will also take place on July 21.
An ECP spokesperson said letters have been sent to the speakers of national and provincial assemblies, requesting the oath-taking of members elected on reserved seats and notified on July 2, 2025. This is to ensure they can assume office and vote in the Senate elections in KP and Punjab.
It may be recalled that Senate elections in KP were previously postponed on April 2, 2024, due to the speaker’s refusal to administer oath to newly elected members on reserved seats.
A fresh notification reads: “In continuation of the earlier notification dated April 2, 2024, whereby the poll date for Senate elections from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province against seven general seats, two women seats, and two technocrats including ulema seats was postponed, the Election Commission of Pakistan hereby appoints July 21, 2025, as the poll date for the said Senate election.”
 
 

The ECP has also issued a detailed schedule for the seat vacated by Dr Sania Nishtar. The public notice will be issued on July 9, nomination papers can be submitted on July 10 and 11, scrutiny will be held on July 16, and polling will take place on July 31. The former PTI lawmaker had resigned in October last year, but her seat was declared vacant on March 10 this year.
Furthermore, a notification has been issued for the election to the seat left vacant by the demise of PML-N Senator Professor Sajid Mir. The revised list of candidates will be issued on July 15, nomination withdrawals are allowed until July 16, and polling will be held on July 21 at the Punjab Assembly building.
In addition, an election schedule has been issued for two vacant seats reserved for PML-N women from KP in the National Assembly. The returning officer will issue a public notice on July 8; nomination papers can be submitted on July 9 and 10; scrutiny will take place on July 14; and the final list of candidates will be released on July 24. The PML-N’s previous priority list has been exhausted, and a new one must be submitted to the priority list counting officer by July 10.

Earlier, media reports suggested that the global tech giant had moved its operations out of the country.
These were based on a LinkedIn post by Jawad Rehman, the former head of Microsoft in Pakistan. Citing sources, he claimed the company “is officially closing its operations in Pakistan”.
Microsoft had an on-ground presence in Pakistan until recently, albeit with a significantly reduced local workforce. Most of its operations were handled from foreign offices and by partners in Pakistan, people familiar with the matter told Dawn.
In response to Dawn’s query, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We will serve our customers through both our strong and extensive partner organisation, and other closely located Microsoft offices. We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world.”

Spokesperson says company to provide services through local partners, offices abroad

The decision to move out of Pakistan was part of the company’s ongoing series of layoffs worldwide as it looks to pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI).
On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it would lay off nearly four per cent of its around 228,000 employees, Reuters rep­orted. In May, the company announ­ced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers.
The company said on Wednesday it planned to manage its operations with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.
Evolving business models
In a statement on Wednesday, the IT and Telecommunications ministry said global tech companies are moving from on-premises software deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Microsoft’s decision is also reflective of this shift.
According to technology expert Habibullah Khan, large software enterprises have two business models: on-premise and Saas.
Under the former model, the company installs and runs software on the customer’s servers or infrastructure, with hardware and data centres managed internally by customers. The company gets a one-time payment through the sale of licences.
On-premise software deployment is a capital-intensive model and results in high upfront costs with recurring needs for maintenance and upgradation.
In comparison, SaaS allows a company to serve a particular location without any on-ground presence as the software is hosted in the cloud. In the model, the company makes money through subscription costs.
With the evolution of technology, more companies have transitioned to SaaS models, as it reduces upfront costs, Mr Khan explained.
Not an ‘exit’
The IT ministry also said Microsoft’s move couldn’t be construed as an exit from Pakistan, but rather a shift to a “partner-led, cloud-based delivery model”.
Over the past few years, several multinational companies in various sectors have either shut down their operations in Pakistan or sold them to local enterprises. Last month, ride-hailing service Careem announced it would end operations in Pakistan from July 18.
 
 

However, Mr Khan believes Microsoft’s move is different from other exits, as the company now earns almost all of its revenue through cloud-based subscriptions.
He added the company is on a global cost-cutting drive and its decision to close the office in Pakistan was reflective of the move towards SaaS-and-AI operating model, “and is not in any way a reflection on Pakistan’s tech ecosystem or its economy”.

The decisions were taken during a key meeting of the Special Task Force on Zaireen, chaired by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi at the Ministry of Interior.
The meeting, held on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was also attended by Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. From 2026 onwards, pilgrims will only be allowed to travel under registered organisers.
The FIA and other relevant bodies have been directed to prevent unauthorised individuals from entering Iraq under the pretext of pilgrimage.
Authorities informed the task force that 1,413 applications have so far been received for registration as Zaireen Group Organisers and the scrutiny process is currently under way.
The Civil Aviation Authority briefed the meeting that the number of weekly flights to Iran has already been increased from six to 15. Additionally, 107 special flights are being arranged for Arbaeen pilgrims heading to Iraq.
Further increase in the number of flights for Zaireen travelling to Iran and Iraq is also under consideration. A ferry service is also being launched to provide better travel facilities to pilgrims in the future. It was agreed that the security situation would be reassessed after Ashura before a final decision is made on the resumption of land travel to Iran and Iraq.
Mr Naqvi emphasised that, in light of the current situation, protecting Zaireen from any trouble or difficulty is the government’s top priority.

• Zarah Sultana says their alternative is ‘rooted in justice & equality’
• Group includes MPs Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed
LONDON: In an overnight reshaping of Britain’s political landscape, Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced she will co-lead the formation of a new political party alongside former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The move signals a break with the Labour Party, which both politicians accused of abandoning its core values.
Sultana declared her resignation from Labour on Thursday evening in a statement that described Westminster as “broken” and accused the two major parties of offering “nothing but managed decline and broken promises.”
She urged supporters to join the duo in building an alternative, rooted in justice and equality.
Though Corbyn has long floated the idea of a more formal vehicle for left-wing and pro-Palestinian politics, Sultana’s announ-cement surprised many within the Independent Alliance, the loose group of five MPs, including Corbyn, who parted ways with Labour mainly over its stance on Gaza. Sources close to Corbyn indicated frustration with the timing of Sultana’s decision, describing it as potentially “premature.”
Still, Corbyn acknowledged ongoing discussions about forming a new political organisation. Speaking on ITV’s Peston, he said: “That grouping [of independents] will come together, there will be an alternative.”
 

Zarah Sultana

While he declined to label it a party or confirm a leadership role for himself, he reaffirmed a commitment to a political movement centred on “peace rather than war,” tackling poverty and inequality.
The pair’s new initiative has drawn comparisons to rising progressive movements abroad. Economist Richard D. Wolff tweeted: “A new political left is rising… in the US, Sanders-AOC-Mamdani, and in the UK now Corbyn-Zarah Sultana. Finally!”
However, some questioned her focus, accusing her of neglecting local issues in Coventry.
‘Collective leadership’
Corbyn, who led Labour from 2015 to 2020 before being suspended in a row over antisemitism, has been cautious about titles, preferring collective leadership. The new group, which includes MPs Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, and Iqbal Mohamed, now matches Reform UK and the DUP in parliamentary numbers, and outpaces the Greens and Plaid Cymru.
Last September, Corbyn attended a closed meeting to discuss launching a new party called Collective, intended to challenge Labour’s centrist turn under Keir Starmer.
In an opinion piece, Guardian columnist Andy Beckett noted that Sultana is usually “one of the most effective political communicators” in the UK.
“She has more followers on TikTok than any MP except Nigel Farage. Unlike him, she has an ability to talk with moral force and clarity: about Palestine, inequality, the rightward shift of the government and other issues particularly important to Britain’s large minority of left-wing voters, a neglected electoral bloc since Corbyn’s Labour leadership ended in 2020.”

Rowdy protests are a common feature of parliamentary proceedings. Legislative history everywhere is replete with instances of fiery, even abusive, exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches.
Occasionally, verbal clashes turn physical. When lawmakers cross acceptable limits, they may be temporarily barred from attending the proceedings. That is what happened in the Punjab Assembly during the recent budget session. Protesting opposition MPAs interrupted Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz — declared as the ruling PML-N’s ‘red line’ — and the Speaker suspended 26 of them for engaging in rowdy conduct and slapped 10 with fines for vandalising assembly property.
The action made headlines, but did not raise alarm. Neither the opposition’s protest nor the Speaker’s response was extraordinary in the context of parliamentary traditions. Regardless of the party in power, Pakistan has often witnessed such incidents since 1988.
However, Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan’s decision to approach the ECP seeking disqualification of the suspended PTI legislators is disturbing, and sets a dangerous precedent in our fragmented parliamentary history.
He outlined several violations including disorderly conduct, misbehaviour and disregard for his rulings to build a case for their disqualification. The move is likely to be challenged in court.
Mr Khan’s contention that such misconduct is a crime against democratic norms and a breach of the oath taken by elected politicians to uphold the Constitution cannot withstand legal scrutiny.
The reference will likely be struck down as the Speaker wrongfully seeks to conflate procedural disruptions with breaching the Constitution. Personal opinion on foul language, hooliganism and physical aggression within the assembly is one thing; equating such behaviour with constitutional violation quite another.
No wonder legal experts have termed the move devoid of logic and an extreme measure. In their opinion, the Punjab Assembly Rules permit only temporary suspension of MPAs, and not their disqualification.
According to them, the Speaker is not empowered to recommend disqualification for a member. The PML-N’s allies see the move as an attempt to eliminate dissent in the assembly. The PPP has rightly questioned whether such action would have been taken had the protesters targeted someone other than Ms Nawaz.
It reminded the ruling party of its own combative past when it routinely used incendiary language and theatrics against then prime minister Benazir Bhutto in and out of the assemblies. The Speaker claims that his move was aimed at upholding the Constitution and maintaining the dignity of the parliamentary process. The reality is that he has taken this step only because the offending lawmakers had interrupted Ms Nawaz. As custodian of the House, he must understand that the only red line for a democrat is the Constitution, and certainly not his leader.

In May alone — when the four-day conflict broke out in the first week—imports stood at $15m, slightly down from $17m in the same month last year.
 
 

However, Pakistan’s exports to India remained negligible. In May, they were recorded at just $1,000, while total exports during July-May FY25 were only $0.5m. In FY24 and FY23, exports stood at $3.44m and $0.33m, respectively—highlighting the highly one-sided nature of bilateral trade.
Traders were reluctant to discuss the continuation of imports during the tense period. One trader suggested the goods might have arrived through third countries, with payments made prior to the hostilities.
“It may have come from a third country and the payment for the May imports would have been made before the war,” he said.

Pakistan’s imports from New Delhi hit 3-year high

Although official data reflects limited trade, Indian research institutions claim actual trade is far higher. The India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) reported last month that India’s unofficial exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn annually, routed primarily through Dubai, Colombo, and Singapore.
Analysts say the unofficial trade remains robust due to Pakistan’s high cost of production and industrial dependence on foreign inputs.
“We should not ignore smuggling from India since the cost of production in Pakistan is the highest in the region, which creates space for goods from India, China, and Bangladesh,” said an exporter.
Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen since 2019, but the data and ground realities suggest economic interdependence persists, albeit through unofficial channels.

An official at MG Pakistan stated the company would absorb the price hike despite the new levy. The assembler of Haval vehicles has also decided to maintain prices at previous levels.
The carbon levy or NEV adoption levy is charged at 1pc on engines below 1300cc, 2pc on engines between 1300cc and 1800cc, and 3pc on engines above 1800cc, applied on the invoice price, including duty and taxes.
 
 

Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) has raised prices across its lineup by Rs18,810 to Rs186,000. The Alto VXR, VXL, and AGS now cost Rs2.994m, Rs3.166m, and Rs3.326m, reflecting increases of Rs167,861, Rs177,480, and Rs186,446, respectively.
In the upgraded Suzuki Cultus range, the VXR, VXL, and AGS models are now priced at Rs4.089m, Rs4.359m, and Rs4.591m, up by Rs40,490, Rs43,160, and Rs45,460, respectively.
The Suzuki Swift GL MT, GL CVT, and GLX CVT now retail at Rs4.460m, Rs4.605m, and Rs4.766m, compared to Rs4.416m, Rs4.560m, and Rs4.719m earlier.

Assemblers increase vehicle prices by up to Rs700,000 following carbon levy and higher GST

Suzuki Every VX and VXR posted price increases of Rs163,230 and Rs166,200, reaching Rs2.912m and Rs2.965m, respectively. Ravi pickup and its without-deck variant now cost Rs1.975m and Rs1.899m, up by Rs19,560 and Rs18,810. PSMCL clarified that the revised prices include FED, sales tax, and carbon levy but exclude advance income tax.
Citing rupee depreciation, rising international freight charges, and the carbon levy, Lucky Motor Corporation increased prices of various KIA models from Rs95,000 to Rs700,000. The Picanto AT, Stonic EX Plus, and EX now sell at Rs4.090m, Rs5.999m, and Rs4.862m after respective increases of Rs150,000, Rs499,000, and Rs95,000.
The Sportage L Alpha, L FWD, and L HEV have seen hikes of Rs400,000 to Rs600,000, now priced at Rs8.899m, Rs10.499m, and Rs11.599m. The Sorento 3.5L V6 now costs Rs13.899m, up by Rs400,000, while its other variants—3.5L V6 EMI, HEV FWD, HEV AWD EMI, HEV AWD, and HEV AWD EMI—range from Rs14.399m to Rs17.199m, marking increases of Rs400,000 to Rs700,000. The Kia Carnival is now priced at Rs18.2m, up by Rs700,000.
However, LMC has kept the prices of its electric vehicles—V5 Air, EV5 Earth, and EV9—unchanged at Rs18.5m, Rs23.5m, and Rs43.2m, respectively.
Atlas Honda Ltd (AHL) has raised the prices of various motorcycles by Rs2,000 to Rs6,000. Its flagship models, the Honda CD 70 and CG-125, now cost Rs159,900 and Rs238,900, respectively.
United Auto Industries has also revised up the prices of several two-wheeler models following the imposition of 18pc GST and the NEV levy. The US-70cc (standard), Self Start, Alloy Rim, and Alloy Rim with Self Start models are now priced at Rs111,000, Rs122,000, Rs121,000, and Rs132,000, compared to Rs93,182, Rs102,411, Rs101,572, and Rs110,801 previously.
Car and bike parts imports surge
Despite the price hikes, bike and two-wheeler sales are expected to remain firm in the coming months, supported by a rising trend in parts and accessories imports by assemblers.
 
 

According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the import bill for semi- and completely knocked-down kits by car assemblers rose by 41pc to $950m during July–May FY25, from $676m in the same period last year. Imports of two-wheeler parts increased by 16.5pc to $43m from $37m during 11MFY24.
According to Large-Scale Manufacturing data, bike production surged by 34pc to 1.362m units in July–April FY25, from 1.013m units in the same period last year.
Mohammad Sabir Sheikh, a bike sector analyst, rul­ed out any adverse impact on sales following the carbon levy. He noted that demand has remained strong since January, with many buyers opting to replace old­er mot­orcycles—typically over five years old—with new models.
Atlas Honda Ltd achieved record monthly production and sales of 130,189 and 130,240 units, respectively, in May 2025.

Any debate on the constitutional merits of this step and the extent to which it damages democracy is redundant. After an election that can only be charitably described as ‘irregular’, the government has been functioning through executive and judicial fiat for the past year, while politics more generally has been stage-managed for the past two and a half years.
The net result is a political sphere — legislature, federal government, judiciary and party activity — heavily regulated by the establishment.
 
 

So what will this latest step help achieve? With two-thirds delivered to the government in the National Assembly, and the Senate remaining its usual pliable self, there are murmurs of a ‘27th Amendment’ shooting for what the 26th attempted but could not score — a federal constitutional court sitting above the current superior judiciary.
It might seem a bit redundant, given how effective the constitutional bench is proving itself to be. But one shouldn’t underestimate the desire for total control. There remain lingering concerns about a potential judicial revolt bubbling up from the high courts against which a more comprehensive insurance policy, such as a superseding judicial structure, may be required.
Another murmur doing the rounds is a reconfiguration of the NFC award, long sought by both the civil-military bureaucracy, and several finance ministers. With the legislature numbers now in place, the next step would be to manufacture some urgency.
The volume on discussions of provincial profligacy in the face of federal impoverishment will go up. All will be told that the provinces put up populist budgets with few taxes, while the federal government does all the hard work (squeezing compliant taxpayers without broadening the base) for them. A revised NFC might seek to frontload some expenses — defence, pensions, debt-servicing — prior to downward transfers.
Finally, a third murmur involves changes to the office of the presidency and who can legally occupy it. It will likely be a familiar revision, seen before on at least three earlier occasions. Given all that has transpired these past few years, it would be an unsurprising development.

Society shows no broad-based winners in the status quo. Instead, any winners here are selective.

Media discourse will busy itself with the possibility of none, one, two, or all three of these happening over the next few weeks. Talk show studios will turn into game theory seminars. But few will ask two fundamental questions: why is this happening and for whom?
Why is all this energy and effort being devoted to twist politics into creating and sustaining a hybrid-authoritarian state? While its architects think they’re creating their own version of China, so far they’ve only managed to recreate a South Asian Egypt. What is the logic at play here?
 
 

Loyalists say this endeavour is a demand placed by the external security environment — a claim recently bolstered by the recent war with India. Others say it is the only way Pakistan can navigate a rapidly changing world order, marked by the erosion of American unipolarity. Another frequent justification is that it is the only way past petty constraints to deliver economic development.
None are new, each of these are as old as the country: authoritarianism, via a strong centre, was the need of the hour after achieving statehood to ensure territorial integrity; authoritarianism was needed to navigate the Cold War; and only authoritarianism could see through reforms needed for the country to prosper economically. The actual track record of all three justifications does not bear repeating. Crass power politics, ie, surviving in office by ensuring a popular force (this time around, the PTI) stays out, ends up as a more plausible ‘why’ every single time.
The other question worth raising is who is all of this in service of? A quick survey of the usual social groups reveals no clear winners. Large industrialists remain unhappy, as they usually are, on account of high interest rates, energy tariffs and new regulations regarding captive power plants. Exporters are no longer getting concessionary financing. Importers are struggling because of dollar liquidity constraints and fewer shenanigans with the exchange rate. Real estate developers and contractors haven’t had many favours since the 2020 amnesty scheme and the latest budget doesn’t do much for them either.
Farmers, especially large landowners, are upset at commodity price crashes and the removal of support prices, which usually worked to their benefit. The middle classes are reeling from three years of real wage erosion and mounting taxes. The working classes are rarely given any consideration in Pakistani politics and it’s foolish to expect their fortunes to be any different today.
 
 

Society shows no broad-based winners in the status quo. Instead, any winners here are selective. Those who have access to the state, those who have access to its decision-makers. Those who’ve been on the right side of some important office holder. It’s not all industrialists, but perhaps one or two. It’s not all contractors, but perhaps a couple who’ve since been busy building underpasses and overheads. A logic of rewarding the right number of people to keep things ticking along remains the dictating logic of this regime.
And it is the same logic that is at play within the state as well. While everyone else gets austerity and low growth, officers of the state — civil and military — face few such constraints. Some get elevated to new ranks. Others get offices they would not have access to otherwise. The right judgement produces an appropriate reward. Timely compliance and deference gets you a two-thirds majority.
So on the rare instance that someone asks ‘why and for whom?’, the easiest answer is power and for those who staff and sustain the state.

The world seems more unstable and unpredictable than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Conflicts have been proliferating. New ones have erupted even as longer-running wars persist.
The Middle East remains in turmoil and the war in Gaza continues. The Ukraine war is still raging. President Donald Trump has contributed much to international volatility by his disruptive policies and upending of the global trade system, but the world was already passing through unsettled times with multilateralism under unprecedented strain. Geopolitical tensions have escalated while the US-China confrontation remains the most significant strategic dynamic in a world in flux.
The global order has been fragmenting with increasing attacks by powerful countries on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of weaker states or those regarded as adversaries. Long-established global norms are being undermined. The threat or the use of force has become all too frequent.
Examples abound of how international law is being flouted with impunity by countries launching military strikes on other nations in what are often disingenuously called pre-emptive wars. This has produced what UN Secretary General António Guterres once described as an “epidemic of impunity”. Israel’s war on Gaza, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombing of Iran, India’s unprovoked attack on Pakistan and Israeli strikes on Iran all violated international law and the UN Charter. Does this represent what some call a new era of escalation? Is this a dangerous ‘new normal’?
Countries taking such military offensives seem to calculate that there will be minimum or no international consequences or diplomatic costs of their actions. This is encouraging a casual and careless defiance of international law. In some cases, there hasn’t even been global condemnation of military aggression.
For example, no Western country denounced the Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, prohibited by international law, additional protocols of the Geneva Conventions and UN Security Council resolutions; instead, some countries applauded the strikes. Then there is the double standard practised by much of Europe towards the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza — condemning Russia and supporting Ukraine but not applying the same principle to Israel, the aggressor, in its genocidal war on Gaza. For many countries of the Global South, this has spelt the denouement of a rules-based order, whose rules were in any case unequally applied and advantaged Western powers.

History is testimony to the fallacy that the use of force can bring peace and security.

 
 

The fraught security environment, marked by lawlessness, armed conflicts and mounting geopolitical tensions, has had an obvious impact. It has led to a significant rise in global defence spending, with the world rearming at an alarming pace. According to the annual 2025 report by Sipri (Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute), global defence expenditure has hit a record level.
The most significant spending increases are accounted for by countries either engaged in or anticipating regional conflict. The annual Military Balance report by IISS (International Institute of Strategic Studies) also found global defence spending soaring to a new high. This is having a destabilising impact at both the global and regional levels.
Growing insecurity and rising threat perceptions have also engendered renewed thinking among countries about seeking nuclear weapons. Having witnessed how Iran and Ukraine were attacked by nuclear powers — Iran, an NPT member-nation being bombed by two nuclear weapon states — many countries have been encouraged to see nuclear weapons as the most viable option for their security.
 
 

The lesson countries facing security challenges may have drawn from recent events is that without nuclear weapons they are more vulnerable to external aggression and attacks on their sovereignty. This makes a discriminatory global non-proliferation regime, that has been eroding over time, more questionable in the eyes of many states. The Sipri report highlights the potential for more countries to consider developing or hosting nuclear weapons. This at a time when the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-armed states are being “enlarged and upgraded”.
Accompanying these trends is declining faith in diplomacy. This doesn’t of course mean that diplomacy isn’t needed, but when diplomacy fails to produce results or negotiations are used as a smokescreen for military action — as Israel has been doing in talks with Hamas and the US did with Iran — its efficacy comes into doubt. This is consequential as the breakdown of trust makes countries reticent and sceptical about negotiations, as for example Iran is in response to talks offers from the US.
Multilateral institutions, too, are faced today with a crisis of credibility and legitimacy. Guterres has repeatedly said trust in global institutions is at a breaking point with multilateral organisations ailing and in need of urgent reform and revitalisation. The loss of faith in multilateralism, he has said, is because people see “broken promises, unmet commitments, double standards, and vast inequalities”.
Former secretary general Ban Ki-moon has gone even further arguing that “the UN is slipping into dysfunction”. In a recent essay in The Economist, co-authored with Helen Clark, he attributed this to the organisation’s powerful members, who “disregard the rule of law when it suits them”, and to “certain leaders who want to see the UN on its knees”.
What has brought the UN into disrepute is the role of the Security Council whose principal responsibility is to prevent conflicts, end wars and preserve international peace. The Council has failed to live up to this responsibility because of its veto-wielding members and the divisions among them. Not only has the SC failed to prevent genocide in Gaza and end Israel’s war there, some of its permanent members have invaded countries, bombed states and attacked the sovereignty of other nations.
What all this adds up to is growing international disorder in which unilateral actions by big countries and regional powers are posing new risks and magnifying threats to international peace and security. The most dangerous approach adopted by leaders of some countries is based on their belief that the use of force will deliver peace and stability. History bears testimony to the fallacy of such a notion.

“An IAEA team of inspectors today safely departed from Iran to return to the agency headquarters in Vienna, after staying in Tehran throughout the recent military conflict,” the Interna­tio­nal Atomic Energy Age­ncy (IAEA) said in a post on X.
 






“IAEA Director Gen­eral Rafael Grossi reiterated the crucial importance of the IAEA discussing with Iran modalities for resuming its indispensable monitoring and verification activities in Iran as soon as possible,” it added.
Iran officially suspended its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog on Wednesday, after Israel launched its first military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, followed by the US strikes last month.
 
 

As a party to the NPT, Iran must account for its enriched uranium, which normally is closely monitored by the IAEA, the body that enforces the NPT and verifies countries’ declarations. But the bombing of Iran’s facilities has now muddied the waters.

In the Nov 25, 2024 meeting, senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had proposed that the minutes of JCP meetings be made public, but the idea was turned down by a majority of members, a well-placed source revealed.
On June 25, Justice Shah again urged the JCP to share minutes of its meetings — citing past transparency measures taken during the tenure of former CJP Justice Qazi Faez Isa, when the minutes of a three-judge committee formed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 were regularly uploaded on the Supreme Court’s official website.
The Nov 25 JCP meeting had been convened to constitute a nine-judge constitutional bench for the Sindh High Court, which was approved by a majority vote of 11 to 4. However, PTI representatives — Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub and Leader of the Opposition in Senate Shibli Faraz — did not attend the meeting.
The JCP waited for nearly two hours for the two members to arrive, but their mobile phones remained switched off. The commission then proceeded with its meeting. Later, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar were nominated to replace Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz in the JCP.
During the session, chaired by CJP Yahya Afridi, Justice Shah invoked Article 19A of the Constitution to argue that the proceedings of the commission should be made public due to the significant public interest involved in its decisions. He emphasised that transparency in judicial appointments was essential to uphold democratic norms and public trust.
 
 

Law Minister Tarar responded that the decision should be based on the collective wisdom of the commission’s members.
AGP Awan noted that the in-camera nature of JCP meetings was prescribed by the commission’s rules of 2010 and that any deviation would require a formal amendment to those rules.
The CJP clarified the current legal framework did not allow disclosure of proceedings, as the existing rules explicitly prohibit it. Nevertheless, he put the matter to a vote.
The proposal was rejected, with 11 members voting against it and only three — including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar — voting in favour. SHC Chief Justice Shafi Siddiqui abstained.
In a fresh letter, Justice Shah reiterated his concern, stating that the opacity surrounding the commission’s working was neither healthy nor democratic and was inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s role as the guardian of constitutional values. He underscored that judicial appointments are acts of public significance with far-reaching consequences.

• MSF mourns colleague slain in previous day’s shooting at aid centre
• UN records 613 killings at GHF aid points & convoys
TEL AVIV/CAIRO: Hamas said on Friday it was ready to start talks “immediately” on a proposal for a ceasefire with Israel, after holding consultations with other Palestinian factions.
“The movement is ready to engage immediately and seriously in a cycle of negotiations on the mechanism to put in place” the terms of a draft truce proposal received from mediators, the group said in a statement.
Earlier on Tuesday, Israel accepted the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas, during which the parties would work towards ending the war.
A source familiar with Hamas’ position said the group was seeking guarantees that talks to end the war would take place during the 60-day truce, and that if no deal was reached by the end of that period, the pause in fighting would be extended till both sides come to terms.
Meanwhile, as US President Donald Trump said he expected Hamas to respond to his “final proposal” for a ceasefire in Gaza in the next 24 hours, at least 20 Palestinians were killed on Friday in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, according to local health officials.
Health officials at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, said the Israeli military had carried out an air strike on a tent encampment west of the city around 2am, killing 15 Palestinians displaced by Israeli attacks.
A Gaza civil defence official said those killed included five who were shot while waiting for aid near a US-run site near Rafah in southern Gaza and several who were waiting for aid near the Wadi Gaza Bridge in the centre of the territory.
They were the latest in a spate of deaths near aid distribution centres in the devastated territory, which UN agencies have warned is on the brink of famine.
At Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, crowds mourned 16 people killed on Thursday by what the civil defence agency said was shooting close to a nearby aid centre.
Medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders said Abdullah Hammad, who recently finished a contract working for it, was among those killed in Thursday’s shooting.
It said he was the 12th colleague the group had lost in the Gaza war.
“We demand an end to this bloodshed,” MSF said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the the UN human rights office said it had recorded at least 613 killings both at aid points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and near humanitarian convoys.
“We have recorded 613 killings, both at GHF points and near humanitarian convoys — this is a figure as of June 27. Since then … there have been further incidents,” Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is yet to comment on Trump’s ceasefire announcement. While some members of his right-wing coalition oppose a deal, others have indicated their support.

The Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, was scheduled to return on Friday after completing four days of talks in Washington.
While both sides have reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
The delegation arrived in Washington on Monday with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products.

Formal announcement expected once Washington wraps up talks with other nations

The tariff relief, temporarily paused earlier this year, was at risk of expiring if no progress had been made by the July 9 deadline.
Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.
The agreement, when signed, could lead to incre­ased Pakistani imports of US goods — notably crude oil — and potential Ameri­can investment in Pakistan’s mining, energy, and infrastructure sectors.
Projects like the Reko Diq copper and gold mine and related energy infrastructure were a focus of the discussions. The deal could also pave the way for expanded engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Although US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier indicated that Washington might allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful pro­g­ress was evident, Pakistani officials say they pushed for early completion to remove uncertainty for exporters and investors.
Officials remain optimistic that the agreement will sustain Pakistan’s access to the US market and help reset bilateral economic ties, which had been under strain since the high tariffs were introduced during the Trump administration.

Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported. The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.
Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.
The heavy rescue machinery struggled to access the narrow alleys, and police baton-charged residents to clear the way, AFP reported.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the government needed to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that had been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). A statement by the authority put the number of such buildings across Karachi at 588.
“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.
“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”
The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.
 


Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to AFP as a “worn-out building”. Police official Arif Aziz told AFP that up to 100 people had been living in the building.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the incident reportedly occurred between 9-9:30am but due to disruption of the communication network, the department received the information late.
He said that as per the residents and relatives, there were still 20-25 people stuck in the rubble and the rescue operation was still under way. He said some families had already realised the gravity of the situation and begun leaving with a few of them having already left the building as its structure had started to deteriorate after the recent rains.
SBCA says issued multiple prior notices to vacate building
Meanwhile, the SBCA said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
It said it had received a complaint from the Sindh Human Rights Commission on July 22, 2022, and the authority had thereafter promptly issued the first ejectment notice on June 2, 2023, directing the residents and occupants to vacate the premises.
It said a second notice was issued on February 28, 2024, followed by a third with a three-day final warning and lastly a fourth notice addressed to the managing director of K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on June 25, 2024, instructing them to disconnect utility services.
The SBCA added that an urgent reminder for ejectment was issued on June 2 with copies sent to the South deputy and assistant commissioners and the Kalari station house officer, requesting their intervention to evacuate the premises and prevent any potential incident.
“On June 29, 2025, the SBCA director also reported that residents were warned via megaphones to evacuate the building immediately.
“Regrettably, the residents were reluctant to vacate the building unless alternate accommodation was provided. Furthermore, the utility agencies, K-Electric, SSGC, and KWSB, did not respond or disconnect services in a timely manner, nor did the district administration paid attention and responded by our issued ejectment notices.
“It is important to note that the monsoon season is ongoing, increasing the risk associated with dangerous structures. According to SBCA records, 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone. The SBCA has repeatedly advertised these threats through print and electronic media.”
It also pointed out that during his tenure, former Sindh chief secretary Sohail Rajput had instructed then-Karachi commissioner Saleem Rajput to take efforts to vacate the buildings declared dangerous by the SBCA Technical Committee. It added that the matter was still pending.
‘We are helpless’: Relatives worry for trapped families
All six family members of 70-year-old Jumho Maheshwari were at his flat on the first floor when he left for work early in the morning.
“Nothing is left for me now — my family is all trapped and all I can do is pray for their safe recovery,” he told AFP.

Another resident, Maya Sham Jee, said her brother’s family was also trapped under the rubble.
“It’s a tragedy for us. The world has been changed for our family,” she told AFP.
“We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.”
Shankar Kamho, aged 30, a resident of the building who was out at the time, said around 20 families were living inside.
“I got a call from my wife saying the building was cracking and I told her to get out immediately,” he told AFP at the scene.
“She went to warn the neighbours, but one woman told her ‘this building will stand for at least 10 more years’. Still, my wife took our daughter and left. About 20 minutes later, the building collapsed.”
Saeed Ghani stresses timely evacuation of unsafe buildings
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident within three days.
His spokesperson Zubair Memon said the committee has been directed to submit a report identifying the responsible officers and their negligence. The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Ghani lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.
“Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building in the past four to six years. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.
“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” Ghani added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.
 






“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.
Ghani said he had been told that the building was built in 1974. “There is an entire mafia that constructs these illegal buildings in the city; we have taken strict action against them and filed FIRs,” he said, urging citizens not to buy or rent such buildings to “end the demand”.
Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.
“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by Memon.
“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
 
 

In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.
Rescue DG lists ‘hinderances’ in operations
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control Centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.
“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.
He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.
He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
The Rescue 1122 head affirmed that the operation would continue till the site was “cleared”.

Sindh CM seeks report
Taking notice of the incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed that rescue teams immediately rescue those trapped under the rubble, while immediate medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“This is an unfortunate incident; concerned authorities should submit an immediate report,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
CM Murad also sought details of dilapidated buildings in Karachi from the SBCA.
“Dangerous buildings should be identified immediately and practical steps should be taken to protect citizens,” CM Murad said. “Negligence will not be tolerated; protection of human lives is the top priority.”

Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori expressed his grief over the incident and ordered rescue authorities to conduct “immediate, effective, and coordinated relief operations”.
In a statement, he directed that all available resources be employed to safely rescue those trapped under the rubble, and that “every possible facility” be provided to the affected families.
“Any kind of neglect or carelessness will be intolerable,” Tessori warned.
 






President, PM stress preventing such future incidents
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep grief and sorrow over the incident, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
In separate statements, the president and the premier offered their “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the family members of those who lost their lives.
Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured, President Zardari directed the Sindh government to expedite the relief efforts and immediately rescue those trapped under the debris.
The president also ordered that the causes of the incident be determined immediately and that effective measures be implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.
 






PM Shehbaz also issued directives that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured.
“Such incidents must be prevented in the future by formulating a strategy on a priority basis,” the prime minister stressed.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, chairman of the PPP that governs Sindh, conveyed his condolences to the aggrieved families and wished the injured a quick recovery.
“I assure [the public] that the Sindh government will provide all assistance [needed],” Bilawal said in a statement shared by his party.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah also expressed their condolences.
Sindh Assembly Syed Awais Qadir Shah, in a statement, highlighted that immediate action must be taken to identify dilapidated buildings and ensure public safety.
Sardar Abdulrahim, information secretary of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), said that further loss of lives could have been avoided if the rescue machinery had reached the site on time.
“A fair of illegal buildings has been set up in the city due to the [Sindh] government’s incompetence,” the GDA leader said.
He demanded that the families of the injured and wounded be provided with financial assistance, that alternate accommodation be arranged for the affected people, and that a case be filed against those responsible for the loss of precious lives.

Air raid sirens, the whine of kamikaze drones and booming detonations reverberated from early evening until dawn as Russia launched what Ukraine’s Air Force said was a total of 539 drones and 11 missiles.
Families huddled in underground metro stations for shelter. Acrid smoke hung over the city centre. Outside a high-rise apartment block damaged by a drone, residents stood around surveying the scene as the clean-up job began. Some cried. Others looked on silently.
“I woke up to the sound of explosions, first the Shahed drones started buzzing, and then the explosions began,” said 40-year-old resident Maria Hilchenko. “Then people started screaming outside. The explosions from the Shaheds kept coming.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack “deliberately massive and cynical”.
“Notably, the first air raid alerts in our cities and regions yesterday began to blare almost simultaneously with media reports discussing a phone call between President Trump and Putin,” Zelensky said on X.
“Yet again, Russia is showing it has no intention of ending the war and terror,” he added, calling for increased pressure on Russia and more air defence equipment.
 






Kyiv officials said the attack damaged about 40 apartment blocks, passenger railway infrastructure, five schools and kindergartens, cafes and many cars in six of Kyiv’s 10 districts. Poland said the consular section of its embassy was damaged in central Kyiv, adding that staff were unharmed.
Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that 14 of the injured were taken to the hospital.
Ukraine’s state-owned railway Ukrzaliznytsia, the country’s largest carrier, said on Telegram that the attack on Kyiv forced them to divert a number of passenger trains, causing delays.
Damage was recorded on both sides of the wide Dnipro River bisecting the capital, and falling drone debris set a medical facility on fire in the leafy Holosiivskyi district, Klitschko said.
Russian airstrikes on Kyiv have intensified in recent weeks and included some of the deadliest assaults of the war on the city of 3 million people.
Call for sanctions
Trump said that the call with Putin on Thursday resulted in no progress at all on efforts to end the war, and the Kremlin reiterated that Moscow would keep pushing to solve the conflict’s “root causes”.
Speaking to reporters on his return to Washington from a trip to Iowa, Trump said, “I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there, and I’m very disappointed.
“I’m just saying I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”
The decision by Washington to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances.
On Friday, Zelensky called for increased pressure on Moscow to change its “dumb, destructive behaviour”.
“For every such strike against people and human life, they must feel appropriate sanctions and other blows to their economy, their revenues, and their infrastructure,” he said.
Ukraine’s Air Force said it destroyed 478 of the air weapons Russia launched overnight. However, airstrikes were recorded in eight locations across Ukraine, with nine missiles and 63 drones, it added.
Social media videos showed people running to seek shelter, firefighters fighting blazes in the dark and ruined buildings with windows and facades blown out.
Both sides deny targeting civilians in the war that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the conflict, the vast majority of them Ukrainian. Many more soldiers are believed to have been killed on the front line, but neither side releases military casualty figures.
Late on Thursday, Russian shelling killed five people in and near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine said.
Trump, Zelensky discuss weapons, escalating Russian strikes
Zelensky said he discussed air defences in a conversation with Trump later on Friday, agreeing to work on increasing Kyiv’s capability to “defend the sky” as Russian attacks escalate.
He added in a message on Telegram that he discussed joint defence production, as well as joint purchases and investments with the US leader.
Ukraine has been asking Washington to sell it more Patriot missiles and systems that it sees as key to defending its cities from intensifying Russian air strikes.
A decision by Washington to halt some shipments of weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against Russia’s airstrikes and battlefield advances. Germany said it is in talks on buying Patriot air defence systems to bridge the gap.
One source briefed on the call told Reuters they were optimistic that supplies of Patriot missiles could resume after what they called a “very good” conversation between the presidents.
US outlet Axios reported, citing unnamed sources, that the call lasted around 40 minutes, and that Trump told Zelensky he would check what US weapons due to be sent to Ukraine, if any, had been put on hold.
Zelensky, speaking later in his nightly video address, said he and Trump had agreed to “arrange a meeting between our teams to strengthen air defences.
“We had a very detailed discussion on joint production. We need it, America needs it.”
Speaking to reporters as he left Washington for Iowa earlier on Friday, Trump said “we haven’t” completely paused the flow of weapons but blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for sending so many weapons that it risked weakening US defences.
“We’re giving weapons, but we’ve given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons,” he said. “And we’re working with them and trying to help them, but we haven’t [completely stopped]. You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.”
The pause in US weapons shipments caught Ukraine off guard and generated widespread confusion about Trump’s current views on the conflict, after saying last week he would try to free up a Patriot missile defence system for use by Kyiv.
Ukrainian leaders called in the acting US envoy to Kyiv on Wednesday to underline the importance of military aid from Washington, and caution that the pause in its weapons shipments would weaken Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia.
The Pentagon’s move has meant a cut in deliveries of the Patriot defence missiles that Ukraine relies on to destroy fast-moving ballistic missiles, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-07-04 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04194145018774b.jpg?r=223155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922095/cm-maryam-orders-arrest-of-2-pakpattan-hospital-officials-suspends-3-doctors-following-infant-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam orders arrest of 2 Pakpattan hospital officials, suspends 3 doctors following infant deaths</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Friday ordered the arrest of two officials and suspended three doctors at Pakpattan’s District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital, following the deaths of 20 infants.
An internal inquiry committee — formed to probe the deaths of only five children on June 19 — reported the deaths of 20 children, raising many serious questions. The findings confirmed that 15 of the 20 deceased were neonates and newborn babies, while all 20 deaths occurred between June 16 and June 22.
A three-member external inquiry committee was formed to investigate the incident, particularly the reported oxygen failure, links between the fatalities and systemic shortcomings and the hospital’s emergency response.
A statement issued today said that during a five-hour visit to the hospital, CM Maryam ordered the arrest of the chief executive officer and medical superintendent. She also suspended and launched inquiries against three pediatric doctors for alleged negligence.
Three laboratory technicians were also arrested for referring patients to their privately run labs operating outside hospital premises.
 






She directed Deputy Commissioner (DC) Maria Tariq to relinquish her charge and report to the Services and General Administration Department.
Upon arrival, CM Maryam was briefed on the preliminary findings of the two external inquiry committee reports.
A representative from the provincial health department and Sahiwal Commissioner Asif Tufail presented the final report. Commissioner Tufail revealed that many infant deaths were linked to the referral of critical newborns from an unregistered private maternity hospital run by traditional midwives and quacks.
He confirmed that oxygen shortage was not a factor, citing the availability of 45 oxygen cylinders at the facility.
He further said that the hospital had failed to follow the protocols of the Punjab Healthcare Commission in running as a major facility in the district.
Subsequently, the health department sealed the operating theatres of four unauthorised private hospitals: Al-Farid Hospital, Doctor Hospital, Shahid Hospital and Ali Hospital.
During the briefing, PML-N MPA Choudhry Javed advocated for upgrading the local nursing college, constructing a multipurpose hall and developing the Western Loop Bypass in Pakpattan City. The chief minister assured that development funds would be allocated as needed.
CM Maryam also ordered action against the owner and the in-charge of the hospital’s parking contractor for overcharging Rs50-100 in excess parking fees.
A comprehensive audit of all medical equipment in the DHQ hospital was initiated. She mandated the implementation of emergency response systems, “Code Red” and “Code Blue”, across all public hospitals in Punjab.
CM Maryam visited multiple wards, laboratories, and the medical store, engaging directly with staff, patients and technicians. Some citizens complained that even basic medicines such as aspirin were unavailable in the emergency ward.
She expressed anger and questioned how patients were forced to purchase medicines externally despite a provincial allocation of Rs100 billion for medicines.
The chief minister said that essential drugs were reportedly available in hospital stores but were not reaching patients.
A letter by Senior Head Nurse Salma Tufail had recently surfaced online in which she had warned the hospital medical superintendent of impending oxygen shortage and the urgent need to maintain supply records.
The letter — written in the first week of June — was circulated on social media. It contradicted the statements of the Pakpattan district health authority chief executive officer who had categorically stated that there was no shortage of oxygen in the pediatric ward during the first three weeks of June.
DC Tariq had questioned the letter’s authenticity, stating, “She (Salma Tufail) submitted that oxygen was available and her letter only requested better documentation.”</p><small>2025-07-04 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04213200a3fab54.jpg?r=215845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922101/no-bar-on-extraditing-individuals-of-concern-if-india-cooperates-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>No bar on extraditing ‘individuals of concern’ if India cooperates, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday said Pakistan had no objection to extraditing “individuals of concern” to India as a confidence-building measure, as long as New Delhi showed willingness to cooperate in the process.
Ties between Pakistan and India have remained tense, further strained after New Delhi, without presenting evidence, blamed Pakistan for the deadly April attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This led to a four-day military confrontation in May, with both sides dropping their guns after American intervention.
The PPP chairman has repeatedly called for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.
Speaking during an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, the PPP chief responded to a question about extraditing Laskhar-i-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-i-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as possible concessions and good-faith gestures to India.
“As part of a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan, where terrorism is one of the issues that we discuss, I am sure Pakistan would not be opposed to any of these things,” Bilawal said.
Both LeT and JeM have been banned by Pakistan, according to the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), while Saeed is currently serving a 33-year sentence for terror financing and Azhar has been proscribed by Nacta.
Bilawal added that cases prosecuted against these “individuals” were those related to Pakistan, such as terrorist financing. However, he noted that prosecuting them for cross-border terrorism was difficult due to noncompliance from Delhi.
“India is refusing to comply with certain basic elements that require that conviction to take place,” he explained. “It’s important … to present evidence within these courts, for people to come over from India to testify, to put up with whatever the counter-accusations will be.
“If India is willing to be cooperative in that process, I am sure there will be no hurdle in extraditing any individual of concern.”
 


‘New abnormal’
Bilawal also expressed concern about India’s vow to pursue terrorists, calling it a “new abnormal”.
“The new normal or the new abnormal that India would like to impose in the subcontinent … is that any terrorist attack within India means war with Pakistan,” he said. “This does not serve the interests of Pakistan, and it does not serve the interests of India.
“Two nuclear-armed countries have got to the point that they have reduced the threshold for military conflict … to this level, which in effect means that we leave the destiny of 1.7 billion people not in the hands of the Pakistani or Indian government, but to nameless, faceless non-state actors,” he added.
Pressed on the whereabouts of Saeed and Azhar, Bilawal stated that the former was incarcerated, while stating that Islamabad believes the latter is in Afghanistan.
“It is factually not correct that Hafiz Saeed is a free man; he is in the custody of the Pakistani state,” he maintained, stating that Islamabad has been unable to arrest Azhar.
“It is our belief that he is in Afghanistan,” Bilawal stated. “If and when the Indian government shares information that he is on Pakistani soil, we will be more than happy to arrest him.
“But the fact is that the Indian government is not referring to them, nor any of these individuals involved in the terrorist attack that justified this war,” the PPP chief continued.
“We went to war on a lie. This is a precedent that has been set and India is trying to exploit: you cry terrorist and attack a sovereign, Muslim country.”</p><small>2025-07-04 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04162501c9061f9.jpg?r=223117' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922079/at-eco-summit-pm-shehbaz-calls-for-regional-cooperation-to-confront-global-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>At ECO Summit, PM Shehbaz calls for regional cooperation to confront global challenges</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday urged stronger regional cooperation in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions, including the Iran-Israel conflict and Indian hostility towards Pakistan, stressing that the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) offered the country its “best hope” for a unified response.
Addressing the 17th ECO Summit in Azerbaijan’s Khankendi city, the prime minister said two recent events — the Iran-Israel war and the India-Pakistan conflict — showed that “the forces of instability and chaos continue to destabilise our region for geo-political agendas.
“The evolving global landscape has made regional cooperation even more essential,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing the 10-nation Eurasian bloc. “ECO represents our best hope, and Pakistan is a proud partner in these collective efforts.”
Speaking about the 12-day Iran-Israel war, he said that “the unlawful, uncalled for and unjustified Israeli attack on Iran was the most recent manifestation of this dangerous trend.”
According to Iran’s health ministry, at least 627 people were killed and 4,870 wounded in Israeli strikes.
“Pakistan condemns this act of Israeli aggression against Iran and offers our condolences to the martyrs,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also condemned the recent Indian aggression against Pakistan and New Delhi’s attempts to weaponise water by holding the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance.
“The unprovoked and reckless Indian hostility directed at Pakistan after an unfortunate incident in India’s illegally occupied Kashmir was yet another attempt to destabilise regional peace.
“The world saw the steadfast determination of our armed forces under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir and the unyielding spirit of our resilient people who stood firm in the face of provocation and responded with courage and professionalism.”
India had launched missile attacks on several Pakistani cities after baselessly accusing Islamabad of backing an attack on held Kashmir’s Pahalgam town, which saw the killing of 26 tourists on April 22.
In response, Pakistan downed five Indian jets and launched retaliatory strikes on India. It took US intervention on May 10 for both countries to reach a ceasefire.
“We are witnessing a new and alarming trend with India’s weaponisation of water, illegal attempt to defy the World Bank-negotiated Indus Water Treaty and its blatant disregard for the recent ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) are unacceptable and should be rejected with contempt.”
Last week, the PCA in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. However, India “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself.
PM Shehbaz said the Indus waters were the lifeline of Pakistan’s 240 million people and India couldn’t be allowed to “pursue this dangerous path that will be regarded as an act of aggression by the people of Pakistan”.
The prime minister also voiced concerns over the situation in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli strikes there, which have killed more than 57,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023.
“The world is witnessing an unprecedented man-made catastrophe in Gaza, a region that has descended into an abyss of perpetual suffering,” the premier said.
“It is as if humanity no longer exists as famine looms large, while humanitarian workers, including UN personnel, are being attacked with impunity by Israel to cut off the only lifeline of the helpless and starving people of Gaza.”
He said Pakistan stood firmly against those who “perpetrate barbaric acts against innocent people, whether in Gaza, occupied Kashmir or Iran”.
Regarding the effects of climate change, the prime minister said Pakistan had undertaken a series of climate-related policy initiatives focused on the government’s Resilience, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF).
He proposed the development of low-emission corridors, ECO-wide carbon market platforms and a regional disaster resistance system.
Earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz held a bilateral meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the ECO Summit.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction over the progress made regarding investment prospects and agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of trade and investment.
They reiterated their resolve to strengthen the economic partnership, especially Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan, according to a statement by the PM’s Office.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the recent interactions between the leadership of both countries helped in making the relationship even stronger. He also invited President Aliyev to visit Pakistan.
In a post on X, the prime minister said he congratulated President Aliyev on “successfully hosting the summit and lauded Azerbaijan’s proactive role in ECO”.
 






He said they “reviewed the progress in Pakistan-Azerbaijan bilateral ties, which are growing stronger through our frequent and productive high-level exchanges”.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to deepen cooperation across diverse sectors, particularly trade and investment,” he added.
The prime minister also met Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian discussed regional developments following the recent Israel-Iran war, said a statement issued by the Press Information Department.
“During the meeting, both leaders reviewed the ongoing bilateral cooperation across all areas and expressed satisfaction over the progress made on the decisions taken during their last meeting for further strengthening of Pakistan-Iran relations,” it added.
PM Shehbaz appreciated Pezeshkian’s leadership and lauded Iran’s decision to reach a ceasefire during the recent conflict, according to the press release.
The premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity” with Iran’s government and people, as well as its strong commitment to continue working closely with Iran for “peace in the region through dialogue and diplomacy”.
“President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s strong diplomatic support to Iran, including at the international forums, during the crisis and thanked him for Pakistan’s vital role in de-escalating the conflict,” according to the statement.
The prime minister requested the Iranian president to convey his warm greetings and good wishes to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, it added.
 






The premier also met Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
“We agreed to deepen our robust partnership, on all areas of mutual interest especially in trade, connectivity, energy, culture and the landmark Trans-Afghan Railway Project.”
 






Azerbaijan inks $2bn investment in Pakistan’s economic sector
Later, Azerbaijan signed an agreement with Pakistan to invest $2 billion in its economic sector.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Azerbaijan’s Minister of Economy Mikayil Jabbarov signed the agreement in the presence of PM Shehbaz and a Pakistani delegation.
“Following a pleasant meeting today in Khankendi between the prime minister and the Azerbaijani president, the agreement was signed between the two countries, while the final and detailed agreement will be signed during the Azerbaijani president’s visit to Pakistan,” PTV reported.
Though it did not provide details, PTV reported that the agreement “elevated the investment and trade relations between the two countries to a historic level”.

The pay hike was announced as part of the budget for the coming fiscal year, where the salaries of federal employees from Grade 1 to 22 would be raised by 10pc and retired government servants would be eligible for a 7pc pension increase.
According to one of the notifications, dated July 4, basic pay to armed forces personnel, civil armed forces, and civil employees of the federal government are subject to the pay raise.
The notification read that the pay would be “subject to income tax; admissible during leave and entire period of LPR except during extraordinary leave; will not be treated as part of emoluments for the purpose of calculation of pension/gratuity and recovery of house rent.”
It further said that the pay would “not be admissible to the employees during the tenure of their posting/deputation abroad; and will be admissible to the employees on their repatriation from posting/deputation abroad at the rate and amount which would have been admissible to them had they not been posted abroad”.
A separate notification, also dated July 4, read that federal government employees from Grades 1-22 could draw on DRA at 30pc of basic pay. The grant applies to those employees already drawing on DRA.
“For those employees who have been appointed on or after July 1, 2022, this allowance will be admissible on the basis of the relevant initial Basic Pay Scale of 2017,” the notification stated.
Last month, the government approved an over fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month.
A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance.
The hike, with a retrospective effect, was effective in January 2025.
Meanwhile, in May, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance to increase the salaries of federal ministers and ministers of state to match those of National Assembly members (MNAs).
The National Assembly’s Finance Committee, headed by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, approved the proposed increase of the monthly salary of each MNA and senator to Rs519,000. Previously, lawmakers received a monthly salary of Rs180,000.
“The federal ministers and ministers of state shall receive a monthly salary equivalent to the salary of a member of the National Assembly,” read the ordinance.</p><small>2025-07-04 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0412464466e1558.jpg?r=124917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922052/over-5500-police-personnel-deployed-across-karachi-for-8th-muharram-processions-today' target='_blank'><strong>Over 5,500 police personnel deployed across Karachi for 8th Muharram processions today</strong></a><br><p>More than 5,500 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi on Friday for the security of 8th Muharram processions.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
According to the Karachi police, as many as 829 processions and 5,227 majalis are scheduled to take place during the first 10 days of Muharram.
“Karachi police [are] performing [their] duties at various locations in the city for the security of the 8th Muharram  processions,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.
A total of 5,543 police officers and personnel will be present to monitor and secure the central procession, the statement added.
It continued that apart from senior officers and 4,957 constables and head constables of the Karachi police, 586 NGOs will also be performing duty for the security of the central procession. Expert police snipers will also be deployed alongside the main procession.
“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 8th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing and keep the public safe from any inconvenience,” the statement said.
“The Karachi police are providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 8th Muharram processions.”
The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.
Separately, Karachi police said that Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho visited the Jama Cloth Market near Iqbal Centre to review the security arrangements for the main procession.
He met with the organisers of the procession and discussed security-related matters, while also directing
the officers and personnel present at the spot to ensure “foolproof” security during the procession.
The statement added that surveillance was being carried out at the procession routes through CCTV cameras and the Command and Control Centre.

In another statement, Karachi police said that South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also reviewed security arrangements for the procession near the city’s southern district.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza was also present, along with other police officers.
The main procession started from Numaish Chowrangi and entered the limits of South district from Taj Medical Complex through the designated routes to finally end at Hussainia Irani Imam Bargah.
SSP Ali met the officers and personnel deployed on the procession route, instructing them to remain fully alert during duty. He directed the security personnel to keep an eye on any suspicious people, vehicles and objects around the procession to prevent any untoward incident.
He also met the organisers of the procession and conducted a joint inspection of the route, assuring them of providing complete security.
A day earlier, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a total of 49,662 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, and Shaheed Benazirabad from 8th Muharram till Ashura to prevent any untoward incident.
He added that 14,546 police personnel would be deployed for security of majalis, while 35,116 to protect Muharram processions. He further said that over 14,000 additional personnel had been assigned to ensure security of all events.
 
 

Also on Thursday, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) issued a traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
According to the KTP plan, Muharram processions on all three days will depart from Nishtar Park and culminate at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah after following their traditional fixed routes.
Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower. Additionally, vehicles performing sabeel, niaz or tabarruk were instructed to enter the procession route at Tower/Memon Mosque.
Lahore arrangements
Meanwhile, Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said in a statement that the rescue service’s secretary reviewed the final arrangements for Ashura and Muharram 9 on the chief minister’s instructions and over 12,000 personnel would be deployed on the weekend.
Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said the arrangements included 815 ambulances, 2,166 motorbikes, 316 fire and rescue emergency vehicles to be deployed.
He said over 1,350 staff would be deployed in Lahore, including 55 emergency ambulances, 300 rescue motorbikes, 44 fire and rescue and specialised emergency vehicles.
Naseer said that additional rescue posts would be set up at more than 1,000 important places on Ashura and Muharram 9 across Punjab and the Provincial Monitoring Cell would oversee all rescue operations. In case of any major emergency or challenging situation, immediate relief teams will also respond from the nearby districts, he said.
He added that district officers would also monitor all operations and keep the Provincial Monitoring Cell updated.
Along with the Ashura arrangements, Naseer said that routine rescue operations would also continue and district officers would mark alternative routes for the provision of immediate rescue services.
Naseer added that providing immediate rescue services to the general public would be ensured at all costs. “In case of any negligence, laziness or shortcomings, strict disciplinary action will be taken immediately,” he said.
Naseer directed citizens to dial 1122 immediately from the mobile app, landline and PTCL in case of an urban emergency.
‘We will not allow anti-state elements to disturb peace’
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (Operations) Faisal Kamran stated that the Lahore Police was fully prepared to respond to any unforeseen situation during Muharram.
According to a statement from the police, Kamran affirmed that “anti-state elements will not be allowed to disrupt the peace of the city, and the duty of protecting citizens will be fulfilled at all costs.”
He made the remarks while inspecting the security setup for processions emerging from inner-city Mori Gate, as well as at Qasr-i-Batool Imam Bargah in Iqbal Town, Ali Raza Abad and other sensitive areas, the statement said.
“He (Kamran) closely examined the entry and exit points of processions, monitoring the checking process for all incoming participants,” the statement read. “He issued essential instructions to officers and Dolphin squads stationed at duty points, emphasising that no individual should be allowed to enter the gatherings without thorough physical screening.”
According to the statement, the DIG instructed officials to remain vigilant of suspicious individuals, unattended bags, and unusual activity, additionally directing that motorcycles and vehicles be parked at safe distances from procession routes.
“Complete adherence to the designated routes and timings of majalis and processions must be ensured,” the statement read.
DIG Kamran was quoted as saying that strict searches are being conducted at the city’s entry and exit points as part of a broader security framework. He appealed to citizens to “cooperate with police personnel during security checks in order to maintain a peaceful environment in Lahore”.</p><small>2025-07-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04192915291465c.jpg?r=192938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922097/karachi-police-arrest-primary-suspect-in-ittehad-town-gang-rape-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police arrest primary suspect in Ittehad Town gang-rape case</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Police on Friday said they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.
In a statement issued today, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police Captain (retired) Faizan Ali said that the Ittehad Town Police had registered the gang-rape case a day ago.
He said the incident had occurred on July 1 when the detained suspect had forcibly taken away the victim on his bike to his dera (sitting place) in Ittehad Town, where he gang-raped her along with his friends.
“The rape survivor managed to escape from the place at night and reached the home of her maternal uncle and later on informed the police about the incident,” he said, adding that her medical examination was carried out at the Civil Hospital Karachi and a case was subsequently registered.
“The main suspect was arrested within hours after the registration of the case, while efforts are underway to arrest other suspects.
“Such beasts are cancer for the society and they will be taken to task,” the SSP vowed.
Despite the presence of laws such as Sections 375-A and 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribe life imprisonment or death for gang rape and up to 25 years for rape, sexual violence against women remains pervasive.
In May this year,  a student was found murdered in a seminary in the Gadap area and an autopsy revealed that he was raped before being killed.
In February, a sessions court sentenced a man to 10 years in prison for raping a minor boy in a Lyari area.
According to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), conviction rates remain dismally low, around 0.5 per cent nationwide in 2024 and under 5pc in other studies.
More than 500 women and underage girls were sexually assaulted in Karachi alone during the year 2023, which also saw 4,042 cases of physical assault on them, a police surgeon had told Dawn.com</p><small>2025-07-04 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04190241f024c13.png?r=192329' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922093/6-dead-as-car-plunges-into-ajks-neelum-valley-officials' target='_blank'><strong>6 dead as car plunges into AJK’s Neelum Valley: officials</strong></a><br><p>Six members of a family were killed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Friday when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the Neelum River, officials said.
The accident occurred at a sharp bend on the Neelum Valley road near Chilyana village, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad.
Chilyana is located across from the Indian-occupied village of Titwal on the opposite bank of the Neelum River, a point that once served as a foot-crossing under the cross-Line of Control (LoC) travel arrangement before activity came to a halt in 2019.
“Shortly after Friday prayers, a vehicle … went out of the driver’s control while negotiating a dangerous curve near Chilyana,” Akhtar Ayoub, the Neelum Valley District Disaster Management Officer (DDMO), told Dawn.com.
“It rolled down the mountain slope but stopped just short of entering the river; otherwise, it would have been swept away by the violent current,” he added.
Ayoub said that upon receiving reports about the incident, a Rescue 1122 emergency unit was immediately dispatched from the district headquarters in Athmuqam.
“Police personnel, army troops, and a large number of local residents also reached the scene and took part in the recovery operation,” he said.
During the operation, the bodies of five women and one man were recovered and transported by Rescue 1122 to a nearby army unit in Nauseri, where they were identified and handed over to the bereaved family, Ayoub outlined.
According to Ayoub, the deceased hailed from Botha Tanda, a village on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad, and were on their way to Jura town in the valley to visit relatives.
They were identified as Ameer Khan, 65; his wife, Gulshan Bibi, 50; his daughters, Naima Bibi, 23, and Mishal Bibi, 21; and his relatives, Sundas, 27, and Halima Basheer, 27.
Meanwhile, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed, and PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir expressed deep sorrow over the tragic loss of lives.
In their condolence messages, they extended sympathies to the bereaved family and urged motorists to exercise extra caution while driving on the region’s mountainous roads.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police lost their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.
According to a statement from the central control room, a police pickup truck was travelling along the Toli Pir–Lasdanna Road when the tragic accident occurred around 6:30pm near a place known as Chatti Dhok.
“The vehicle skidded off the road and tumbled hundreds of feet down the mountainside, crashing into trees and rocks before being reduced to the wreckage,” said Khalid Kiani, an official at the police control room in Rawalakot.</p><small>2025-07-04 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04184922b7ee205.jpg?r=190412' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922094/syria-ready-to-work-with-us-to-return-to-1974-disengagement-deal-with-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Syria ready to work with US to return to 1974 disengagement deal with Israel</strong></a><br><p>Syria said on Friday it was willing to cooperate with the United States to reimplement the 1974 disengagement agreement with Israel, which created a UN-patrolled buffer zone separating the two countries’ forces.
In a statement following a phone call with his US counterpart Marco Rubio, Asaad al-Shaibani expressed Syria’s “aspiration to cooperate with the United States to return to the 1974 disengagement agreement”.
Washington has been pushing diplomatic efforts towards a normalisation deal between Syria and Israel, with envoy Thomas Barrack saying last week that peace between the two was now needed.
Speaking to The New York Times, Barrack confirmed this week that Syria and Israel were engaging in “meaningful” US-brokered talks to end their border conflict.
Following the toppling of longtime Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel deployed its troops into the UN-patrolled zone separating Syrian and Israeli forces.
It has also launched hundreds of air strikes on military targets in Syria and carried out incursions deeper into the country’s south.
Syria and Israel have technically been in a state of war since 1948.
Israel conquered around two-thirds of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, before annexing it in 1981 in a move not recognised by much of the international community.
A year after the 1973 war, the two reached an agreement on a disengagement line.
As part of the deal, an 80-kilometre-long (50-mile) United Nations-patrolled buffer zone was created to the east of Israeli-occupied territory, separating it from the Syrian-controlled side.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Monday that his country had an “interest” in normalising ties with Syria and neighbouring Lebanon.
He however added that the Golan Heights “will remain part of the State of Israel” under any future peace agreement.
Syrian state media reported on Wednesday that “statements concerning signing a peace agreement with the Israeli occupation at this time are considered premature”.</p><small>2025-07-04 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0418084732337eb.jpg?r=180931' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922087/escaped-lion-attacks-woman-and-children-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Escaped lion attacks woman and children in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>A pet lion escaped and chased a woman and two children down a busy street in Lahore, police said on Friday, with dramatic footage showing the big cat leaping over a wall before pouncing on them.
CCTV footage released by the police showed the lion jumping the barrier around its home and pursuing a woman carrying her shopping on Thursday night.
The lion jumped on her back, knocking her to the ground, the footage showed.
A police report quoted the father as saying the lion then turned to his five-year-old and seven-year-old children, and clawed their arms and faces.
All three were taken to the hospital but were not in critical condition.

The owners who ran out of the house were “amused to see their lion attack” the passersby, the father added in the report.
Police said on Friday they had arrested three men.
“The suspects fled from the spot, taking the lion with them. They were arrested within 12 hours of the incident,” the office of the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations told AFP.
The lion, an 11-month-old male, was confiscated by police and sent to a wildlife park. Officials at the facility said that the animal appeared to be in good health.
 
 

Keeping exotic animals, especially big cats, as pets has long been seen as a sign of privilege and power in Punjab.
In December 2024, an adult lion escaped from its enclosure in another neighbourhood of Lahore, terrorising residents before being shot dead by a security guard.
The incident prompted the provincial government to pass new laws regulating the sale, purchase, breeding and ownership of big cats. The law now requires owners to obtain licenses for the animals which are barred from being kept in residential areas.
Breeders have to pay a hefty fee for registration, while farms have to be a minimum of 10 acres in size.</p><small>2025-07-04 13:26</small></div><hr>
