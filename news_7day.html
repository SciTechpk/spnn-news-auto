According to the statement, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the attack, which took place in the Mir Ali area in North Waziristan, and expressed his condolences and prayers for the martyrdom of the personnel.
“I salute security personnel and their families who have sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.
“Security forces have made unprecedented sacrifices to establish peace in the country and eliminate terrorism,” the CM added. “These sacrifices further raise the resolve and morale of the nation against terrorism.
“Everyone in the nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed told Dawn.com that four civilians were injured in the “suicide attack” carried out through a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.
The attack comes days after two soldiers were martyred and 11 terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s South Waziristan district.
No one has so far claimed responsibility.
On June 15, a Frontier Corps (FC) soldier was martyred in a targeted gun attack in Ladha tehsil of Upper South Waziristan district.
Earlier this month, 14 terrorists were killed in North Waziristan’s Datta Khel town during a security operation.
 
 

Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.
The military has said India was using its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

The current government has reassured that the country has moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, witnessing “economic stabilisation” after a period of turbulence and uncertainty.  Some assessments by global rating agencies have signalled gradual improvements in key economic indicators.
In a statement on X, Schehzad said, “As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg Intelligence, Pakistan stands out globally as the most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied probability.”
He said that the country has topped the Global Emerging Markets rankings with the “largest drop in sovereign default risk globally over the last 12 months”.
The statement said, “[The] default probability [went] down from 59 per cent to 47pc, a massive 1,100 basis points improvement.”
“This marks the sharpest decline among major emerging markets, ahead of Argentina (-7pc), Tunisia (-4pc), and Nigeria (-5pc).”
 
 

The country’s ranking contrasted with places like Turkey, Ecuador, Egypt, and Gabon, which have seen their default risks rise, it added.
The statement also said that the “sharp decline in Pakistan’s risk signals renewed investor confidence” through macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, successful International Monetary Fund engagement and timely debt repayments, and improved credit outlooks by S&P, Fitch, and others.
Terming it “a resounding signal to global investors”, Schehzad said, “Pakistan is not only back on the map — it is moving forward with stability, credibility, and reform at its core.”
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, exuding confidence that Pakistan’s economy would be able to post growth of 2.7 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).
A United Nations report in May said that Pakistan was expected to experience “moderate growth, stabilising after a period of economic contraction”, with its GDP projected to expand by 2.3pc in 2025.</p><small>2025-06-28 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/28165143fd8dab6.jpg?r=165942' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920808/uk-distances-new-spy-chief-from-nazi-grandfather' target='_blank'><strong>UK distances new spy chief from ‘Nazi’ grandfather</strong></a><br><p>The British government has distanced the incoming head of its foreign intelligence service from her grandfather following reports he was a Nazi spy known as “the Butcher”.
Blaise Metreweli will, in the autumn, become the first woman to lead MI6 in its 116-year-old history, the British government announced earlier this month.
The Daily Mail newspaper reported this week that her grandfather Constantine Dobrowolski defected from the Soviet Union’s Red Army to become a Nazi informant in the Chernigiv region of modern-day Ukraine.
The newspaper said German archives showed Dobrowolski was known as “the Butcher” or “Agent No 30” by Wehrmacht commanders.
“Blaise Metreweli neither knew nor met her paternal grandfather,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.
“Blaise’s ancestry is characterised by conflict and division and, as is the case for many with eastern European heritage, only partially understood. It is precisely this complex heritage which has contributed to her commitment to prevent conflict and protect the British public from modern threats from today’s hostile states, as the next chief of MI6.”
The Daily Mail said Dobrowolski had a 50,000 ruble bounty placed on him by Soviet leaders, and was dubbed the “worst enemy of the Ukrainian people”.
He also sent letters to superiors saying he “personally” took part in “the extermination of the Jews”, the newspaper added.
The head of MI6 is the only publicly named member of the organisation and reports directly to the foreign minister.
Metreweli, 47, will be the 18th head of MI6.
Like her predecessors, she will be referred to as “C”, not “M” as the chief is called in the James Bond film franchise.</p><small>2025-06-28 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/281530079017bd5.png?r=165214' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792/26-opposition-mpas-barred-from-punjab-assembly-for-15-sittings-over-disorderly-conduct' target='_blank'><strong>26 opposition MPAs barred from Punjab Assembly for 15 sittings over ‘disorderly conduct’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted the proceedings, it emerged on Saturday.
The members raised slogans and protested during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s speech in the assembly yesterday, when she responded to PTI leadership’s comments that ex-premier Nawaz Sharif — also an MNA — had been removed from the political arena.
According to an order issued by Malik on Friday, the suspended MPAs “became disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices”, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”.
The order was issued under Rule 210 of the Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure 1997 (power to order withdrawal or suspension of member) and stated that the 26 MPAs violated four provisions of Rule 223.
These were (c) (shall not interrupt any member while speaking by disorderly expression or noises or in any other disorderly manner), (f) (shall maintain silence when not speaking in the assembly), (h) (shall not chant slogans, display banners or placards, throw and tear table documents and reports, etc), and (i) (shall not indulge in rowdy behaviour).
 






The MPAs also allegedly manhandled the treasury members, blocking their way as they tried to approach the treasury benches with “threatening gestures”.
Malik, in his order, said he repeatedly tried to call the assembly to order, but the opposition “declined to act in accordance with the Rules and persisted with misconduct and disorder and kept challenging my orders and authority”.
The speaker concluded that the opposition MPAs had “disregarded [his] authority as speaker […] consistently and willfully obstructing the business of the assembly”.
Out of the 26 MPAs suspended, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.
 






The following 26 lawmakers were suspended:

10 MPAs fined for ‘vandalism’
Separately, the Punjab Assembly secretary general has also fined 10 MPAs Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, according to a letter issued today.
According to Malik, opposition members had tried to interrupt the budget speech by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman. He claimed SIC’s Hassan Malik had hit the minister with the budget book repeatedly, causing the Rehman to stop his address.
The letter by Chaudhry Amer Habib to the 10 lawmakers stated that the fine was being imposed on account of damages, as eight microphones were broken after the named individuals climbed upon the desks. It also cited a video recording of the incident.
The statement added that if the payment was not made within seven days, action would be taken under the Punjab Government Dues Recovery Ordinance 1962.
 
 

The 10 MPAs included six who have been suspended over yesterday’s session — SIC’s Tanveer Aslam, Imtiaz Mahmood and Riffat, along with PTI’s Nisar, Ismael and Aurangzaib.
Others were Shahbaz Ahmed, PTI’s Chaudhry Javed Kausar and Mohammad Ahsan Ali, and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Asad Abbas.
The MPAs, the letter said, had violated Rule 223 (r), which states that a lawmaker “shall not break or harm any furniture, equipment or device installed in the chamber”.
Malik directed the recovery of the damage under Rule 235 (residuary powers of the speaker.</p><small>2025-06-28 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2815541815a755e.jpg?r=155434' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920806/immigrants-scramble-for-clarity-after-us-supreme-court-birthright-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>Immigrants scramble for clarity after US supreme court birthright ruling</strong></a><br><p>The US Supreme Court’s ruling tied to birthright citizenship prompted confusion and phone calls to lawyers as people who could be affected tried to process a convoluted legal decision with major humanitarian implications.
The court’s conservative majority on Friday granted President Donald Trump his request to curb federal judges’ power but did not decide the legality of his bid to restrict birthright citizenship.
That outcome has raised more questions than answers about a right long understood to be guaranteed under the US Constitution: that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen at birth, regardless of their parents’ citizenship or legal status.
Lorena, a 24-year-old Colombian asylum seeker who lives in Houston and is due to give birth in September, pored over media reports on Friday morning. She was looking for details about how her baby might be affected, but said she was left confused and worried.
“There are not many specifics,” said Lorena, who like others interviewed by Reuters asked to be identified by her first name out of fear for her safety.
“I don’t understand it well.”
She is concerned that her baby could end up with no nationality.
“I dont know if I can give her mine,” she said.
“I also don’t know how it would work, if I can add her to my asylum case. I don’t want her to be adrift with no nationality.”
Trump, a Republican, issued an order after taking office in January that directed US agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of children born in the US who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident.
The order was blocked by three separate US district court judges, sending the case on a path to the Supreme Court. The resulting decision said Trump’s policy could go into effect in 30 days but appeared to leave open the possibility of further proceedings in the lower courts that could keep the policy blocked.
On Friday afternoon, plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit in federal court in Maryland seeking to establish a nationwide class of people whose children could be denied citizenship.
 
 

If they are not blocked nationwide, the restrictions could be applied in the 28 states that did not contest them in court, creating “an extremely confusing patchwork” across the country, according to Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst for the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.
“Would individual doctors, individual hospitals be having to try to figure out how to determine the citizenship of babies and their parents?” she said.
The drive to restrict birthright citizenship is part of Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, and he has framed automatic citizenship as a magnet for people to come to give birth.
“Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn’t meant for that reason,” he said during a White House press briefing on Friday.
Worried calls
Immigration advocates and lawyers in some Republican-led states said they received calls from a wide range of pregnant immigrants and their partners following the ruling.
They were grappling with how to explain it to clients who could be dramatically affected, given all the unknowns of how future litigation would play out or how the executive order would be implemented state by state.
Lynn Tramonte, director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said she got a call on Friday from an East Asian temporary visa holder with a pregnant wife. He was anxious because Ohio is not one of the plaintiff states and wanted to know how he could protect his child’s rights.
“He kept stressing that he was very interested in the rights included in the Constitution,” she said.
 
 

Advocates underscored the gravity of Trump’s restrictions, which would block an estimated 150,000 children born in the US annually from receiving automatic citizenship.
“It really creates different classes of people in the country with different types of rights,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant rights organisation United We Dream.
“That is really chaotic.”
Adding uncertainty, the Supreme Court ruled that members of two plaintiff groups in the litigation — CASA, an immigrant advocacy service in Maryland, and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project — would still be covered by lower court blocks on the policy.
Whether someone in a state where Trump’s policy could go into effect could join one of the organisations to avoid the restrictions, or how state or federal officials would check for membership, remained unclear.
Betsy, a US citizen who recently graduated from high school in Virginia and a CASA member, said both of her parents came to the US from El Salvador two decades ago and lacked legal status when she was born.
“I feel like it targets these innocent kids who haven’t even been born,” she said, declining to give her last name for concerns over her family’s safety.
Nivida, a Honduran asylum seeker in Louisiana, is a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project and recently gave birth. She heard on Friday from a friend without legal status who is pregnant and wonders about the situation under Louisiana’s Republican governor, since the state is not one of those fighting Trump’s order.
“She called me very worried and asked what’s going to happen,” she said.
“If her child is born in Louisiana is the baby going to be a citizen?”</p><small>2025-06-28 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2815003205420e3.jpg?r=150237' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920797/intermittent-showers-in-karachi-to-continue-till-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Intermittent showers in Karachi to continue till tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Met Office has forecast intermittent showers in Karachi till tomorrow as the city continues to receive rain for a third consecutive day on Saturday.

THIS screengrab from a viral video shows the ill-fated family from Sialkot, who became stranded as the river swelled around them.

SWAT: At least 13 tourists drowned in the flooded River Swat on Friday after being caught in the gushing water while having breakfast on the riverbank, rescue officials confirmed.
The casualties occurred near Mingora as the water level in the river rose following two days of rainfall.
According to eyewitnesses, 22 tourists, who had arrived from Sialkot and Mardan, were having breakfast along the river near the Bypass in Mingora, a popular picnic spot, when they were caught in the flood.
Niaz Khan, the spokesperson for Swat Rescue 1122, said eight bodies had been recovered so far, while the search was underway for five missing individuals.
He confirmed that all other trapped people were successfully rescued.

The deceased were identified as Ayan, 7; Rubina, 45; Ajwa, 18; Sharmeen, 16; Murab, 18; and Tazmeen, 20; from Sialkot, and Aishal Naseer and Farman Hussain from Mardan.
Muhammad Mohsin, a tourist from Sialkot who managed to survive, said 17 people were sitting for breakfast, of which 10 drowned, while seven were saved by locals and Rescue 1122 divers.
Videos of the incident showing the victims stranded in the flooded river went viral on social media.
Eyewitnesses and locals said the tourists, including families, were caught off guard by the rapidly rising water level.
They claimed the tourists remained stranded for over an hour, but rescue teams didn’t arrive in time to save them. Locals tried to save the trapped tourists, with one man, Muha­mmad Hilal, rescuing three people from the gushing river. According to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Aut­hority (PDMA), 16 persons were washed away, of whom three were rescued and nine dead bodies have been recovered. Four persons were still missing.
PDMA has put the death toll at 10, including four men, three women and four children.
In its report, the authority claimed the victims “went into the [middle] of River Swat”.
Earlier, the PDMA had issued a flood alert after water as the discharge level in Swat river at Khwazakhela surged to 77,782 cusecs — a very high flood state.
Fayaz Zafar, a local journalist, said despite the warning, the district administration didn’t take preventive measures, such as imposing Section 144, which could have restricted public access to riverbanks.
Locals also pointed to gravel mining in the riverbed as a contributing factor to the disaster, as it “altered the natural flow of the river”, making it more prone to flooding.
Deaths in other areas
According to PDMA, six people got trapped in flooded water bodies in Lower Dir. Five of them were rescued, while the search for one person, who drowned near Ghari Rahimabad, was underway.
They included two women, as many children and an elderly man, officials said.
The dead body of one person was also recovered from the Swat river in Malakand.
In Abbottabad, Rescue 1122 recovered the bodies of two children who drowned in the Door river on Thursday.
According to officials, the identities of the deceased had not been confirmed. Their bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital, Havelian for legal formalities.
The region received heavy rainfall, especially in Abbottabad and the surrounding hilly areas of Galiyat, which inundated residential areas and flooded water bodies.
The main Abbottabad-Mansehra Road remained blocked for several hours at Supply and at Kala Pul due to overflowing water.
In Door river has also swelled in Harno, Abbottabaed, after which, the local administration warned tourists against approaching the riverbank.
Additionally, police have set up a checkpoint on the road leading to the river to restrict public access.
Responding swiftly to emergency calls, the Rescue 1122 Water Rescue and Disaster Team rushed to both sites. After intense efforts, they successfully evacuated all the trapped individuals to safety without any casualties.
In Shangla, three vehicles were damaged after being hit by falling rocks during a landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Bely Baba area on Friday morning.
Flash floods were also reported in different rivers, including the Indus.
Umar Rehman, the Shangla police spokesperson, told Dawn the vehicles which were parked near a hotel.
He said a portion of the hotel was also affected by the landslide. However, no casualties were reported.

Monsoon rains across the region offer respite from the summer heat and are vital for agriculture and food security. Weather-related incidents are common during the season, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.
Two people died while four were wounded in a roof collapse incident reported at 3:20am in the Abbas Nagar area of Lahore’s Shahdara Town, Rescue 1122 said in a statement today.
It noted that the house was single-storied and the roof was made of mud. The bodies were taken to Shahdara Hospital, where some of the injured were also taken, while others wounded were brought to Mayo Hospital.
 
 

Separately, eight children were among 12 dead while 39 others were injured in various rain-related incidents across Punjab since Wednesday, according to a PDMA report issued today.
From Wednesday to Friday, 25 incidents were reported in various cities, which rose to 28 today, a statement by the PDMA spokesperson said.
Most of the cases involved wall and roof collapses due to torrential rains, accounting for nine out of 12 lives lost during the four-day period, according to the report.
In Kasur, two children died from a roof collapsing while another two lost their lives in a wall collapse incident. One child each died in roof collapse incidents in Okara, Bahawalnagar and Faisalabad.
In Wazirabad, a wall collapsing killed a man and a child, along with injuring a woman and another minor.
In Jhelum, the PDMA report said, two men “drowned in a rainwater nullah”. A recent report detailed that a loader rickshaw fell into a storm drain on an inundated road.
The PDMA report also mentioned a lightning incident in Khanewal that took the life of a man.
Other districts where casualties were reported were Mandi Bahauddin, Sahiwal, Chiniot, Multan, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib. Separately, a cow perished in Rahim Yar Khan after a tree fell due to a windstorm.

Irfan Ali Kathia, the PDMA director general, issued directives to provide medical assistance to the injured as well as financial aid to their relatives.
In a statement, he also requested citizens to avoid non-essential travel during inclement weather conditions.
“Do not live in dilapidated houses,” he advised. “Take care of the children [and] do not let them go near the rainwater drains, electric wires and poles.”
Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will continue till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week, adding that rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.

Considering the ecological significance of Changa Manga, Uchali Lake and Chashma for their rich flora and fauna, these sites were strategically selected for ecotourism development, officials at the Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries Department told Dawn.
Mentioning initiatives taken under the spotlight of ecotourism, the officials said the proposed ecotourism development.
Changa Manga Forest Reserve, located 80km south of Lahore, spans over 12,500 acres and is one of the world’s largest man-made forests. It is home to a rich variety of native flora and fauna. With the proposed ecotourism development, the annual visitor footfall is expected to be 1.5m, reflecting increased public interest in nature-based recreation and conservation tourism.
According to the officials, key attractions such as the Botanical Bird Paradise with Butterfly Garden, Mini Zoo, and Animal Enclosures are designed to foster biodiversity awareness, promote wildlife education, and support species conservation efforts. A range of engaging facilities including an Information Centre, Amphitheatre, Craft Bazaar, Picnic Areas, and a Heritage Walk will provide visitors with a diverse blend of recreational, and cultural experiences.
 
 

Immersive nature experiences such as the jeep safari, electric tram rides, watch towers and jeep tracks have been planned for the tourists. The visitors will engage with the environment through a variety of well conceived, eco-friendly facilities that enable immersive and responsible interaction with the forest’s natural landscapes and wildlife.
A medical centre will be established to provide prompt emergency healthcare services, with special preparedness for incidents such as snake bites and other wildlife-related injuries, ensuring the safety and well-being of visitors, staff, and researchers. The project also emphasises capacity building and community empowerment through training programs for staff and local stakeholders.
 
 

The officials say that the development of ecotourism at Uchali Lake and Chashma is projected to attract 250,000 visitors annually at each site, providing opportunities for nature-based recreation while ensuring the preservation and protection of sensitive habitats through regulated access, infrastructure planning, and visitor education.
The sites will feature a variety of eco-accommodation options such as ecolodges and glamping pods, offering comfortable yet environmentally responsible stays. Boating and fishing decks, along with kids’ play zones will provide family-friendly and immersive outdoor experiences that encourage engagement with nature in a safe and controlled manner.

In China, diverting floodwaters to areas next to rivers is a major step in managing downstream flooding. As extreme rainfall grows in frequency, China is increasingly utilising such areas, some of which have been unused until now and have been populated by farms, croplands and even residential buildings, stoking social tensions.
According to revised rules on compensation related to flood diversions released late on Friday, the central government will now bear 70 per cent of all compensation funds, with local governments responsible for the rest. Previously, the ratio was to be decided based on actual economic losses and the fiscal situation of local governments.
Livestock and poultry that cannot be relocated in time before the arrival of diverted floodwaters will also be included in the compensation scheme for the first time. Previously, only the loss of working animals could be claimed for compensation.
In the summer of 2023, almost 1 million people in Hebei, a province on the doorstep of Beijing, were relocated after record rain forced authorities to divert water from swollen rivers to some populated areas for storage, triggering anger over the homes and farms sacrificed to save the Chinese capital.
China currently has 98 designated flood diversion areas spanning major river basins including the Yangtze River basin, home to a third of the country’s population. During the 2023 Hebei floods, eight flood storage areas were used.
Since the start of the East Asia monsoon in early June, precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze has been up to two times higher than usual, officials from the China Meterological Administration told reporters on Friday.
In other parts of China, daily rainfall measured by 30 meteorological stations in provinces such as Hubei and Guizhou broke records for the month of June, they said.
Guizhou was the focal point of China’s flood alleviation efforts this week, with one of its cities hit by flooding on a scale that meteorologists said could only happen once in 50 years, and at a speed that shocked its 300,000 residents.
That prompted Beijing to issue pledges on Thursday to move vulnerable populations and industries to low-flood areas and allocate more space for flood diversion.</p><small>2025-06-28 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2811303620063f4.jpg?r=113551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920709/body-of-abducted-boy-recovered-in-mastung' target='_blank'><strong>Body of abducted boy recovered in Mastung</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The body of a 14-year-old student, Muhammad Musawir Kakar, who was kidnapped for ransom on November 15, 2024 has been recovered by the police, Quetta DIG Aitzaz Ahmed Goraya said on Friday.
He revealed that Afghan nationals were involved in the kidnapping. They abducted the boy with the help of local accomplices and later handed him over to the extremist group Daesh, also known as IS, which demanded a ransom of $12m from the victim’s father.
The DIG added that after killing the boy, the kidnappers buried his body in the Maro Isplinji area of Mastung district. The grave was located by the police.
The body appeared to be over two months old, he said, adding the postmortem report revealed the boy was shot in the chest and head. His identity was confirmed through DNA testing.
 
 

“We tracked down the kidnappers, raided multiple locations, and eliminated some of them, but unfortunately, we were unable to ensure the safe recovery of the boy, for which we are deeply sorry,” said DIG Goraya.
He added that the investigation traced phone calls made from Iranian and Afghan numbers, and authorities were able to locate the hideouts.
The DIG said that on Nov 20 last year, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and Frontier Corps raided a suspected hideout in Dasht, where a militant detonated explosives, injuring CTD personnel and damaging a vehicle.
DIG Goraya claimed that the facilitators, including those who provided logistical and technical support to kidnappers, have also been arrested.
He said the vehicle used in the kidnapping was also recovered just two days later.

According to The Wire, during a trilateral meeting in Kunming, China, on June 19 involving Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong, Bangladesh’s acting foreign secretary Ruhul Siddique and Pakistan’s additional foreign secretary Imran Siddiqui, the three sides agreed to explore cooperation in a number of sectors including trade, ‘maritime affairs’, health and the environment.
Asked for comment on the meeting during the ministry’s weekly press briefing on Thursday, spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that “we maintain a constant watch on the developments in our neighbourhood that have a bearing on our interest and our security”.
 
 

“Our relations with individual countries, while they stand on their own footing, take into account the evolving context as well,” he added.
According to The Wire, New Delhi’s remarks suggest a degree of discomfort with the trilateral meeting, comprising countries with whom it either has hostile or uneasy relations, and come as it has otherwise publicly espoused the view that it does not see bilateral relations through the lens of third countries.
Incidentally, the Chinese readout of the trilateral meeting had noted that cooperation among the three sides was “not directed at any third party”.
Dhaka echoed this view on Thursday, with its interim foreign adviser Touhid Hossain telling reporters that the meeting was “certainly” not “targeting any third party”.
‘Readjustment’ in Delhi-Dhaka ties
He also acknowledged that Dhaka’s relationship with New Delhi was undergoing “readjustment” during the tenure of Muhammad Yunus’s interim government as compared to warmer relations earlier under deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who has remained in India since she took refuge here immediately after her violent ouster in August last year.
Bilateral relations have soured after Yunus took office, with India insisting that religious minorities in Bangladesh have been vulnerable to being attacked under his watch.

The money would be returned to over 67,000 Pakistani pilgrims who were supposed to go on Haj through private tour operators but couldn’t over delays in payments.
The sub-committee of Senate Standing Committee on Religious Affairs on Friday directed the ministry to fully reimburse the victims.
The sub-committee’s convener, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, announced that Rs36.43 billion held in Saudi Arabia must be refunded by August 15.
There should be no deductions whatsoever, including currency exchange losses or service charges, Mr Bappi emphasised.
 






Religious Affairs Secretary Dr Attaur Rehman informed the committee that Pakistan was allotted a quota of 179,210 pilgrims for the Haj in 2025 by the Saudi government.
Of this quota, 90,830 slots were allocated to private Haj operators.
However, the Saudi government later revised its policy to only allow operators with a group of 500 to 2,000 pilgrims.
None of the 903 registered private tour operators in Pakistan fulfilled this requirement, the official said.
 
 

He claimed that despite multiple communications from the min­­istry, the Haj Operators Associat­ion of Pakistan (HOAP) obtained a stay order from the Sindh High Court against the policy.
The stay was vacated on January 7 but by then, the window to deposit payments had nearly closed.
During the legal deadlock, HOAP had transferred 50m riyals to the Pakistani Haj Mission’s account.
After the stay was lifted, the ministry instructed the private operators to promptly deposit the remaining funds into a designated Saudi E-Wallet account.
However, by the Saudi cut-off date of February 14, only 187m riyals had been deposited.
According to Saudi policy, only pilgrims who had paid the full 14,000 riyals by Feb 14 were eligible to perform Haj.
As a result, only 26,986 remained eligible as their full payment was deposited.
Director General Haj Abdul Wahab Soomro reported that 667m riyals were transferred to Saudi accounts by Pakistani private operators, out of which 489m riyals — around Rs36.43bn — remained unutilised and are still held in Saudi Arabia.
Senator Dinesh Kumar said the negligence of officials and tour operators deprived 67,000 Pakistanis of a chance to fulfil their religious obligation.
 
 

Senator Bushra Anjum Butt strongly slammed HOAP’s absence from the meeting, stating that it was unacceptable for the main stakeholders to skip a session that directly concerned them.
The sub-committee also directed the ministry to submit the complete list of existing private tour operators, along with new applicants, to the standing committee.
Senator Bappi suggested the federal government establishes a high-level commission to evaluate and regulate the operations of private Haj operators. “This would ensure that such failures are not repeated in future Haj”.
He further directed the government to ensure public awareness of the Saudi Haj policy for the next season.
The committee also discussed a letter written in March 2025 by former Religious Affairs minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, expressing concerns over the award of contracts related to hotel bookings, transport, catering, and Mashaheer services.

• Seven judges accept review petitions by ECP, PML-N et al; three judges ‘partially allow’ them
• 77 reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies will be distributed among other parties
• Ruling coalition can now comfortably achieve two-thirds majority in NA
ISLAMABAD: The Constit­utional Bench (CB) on Friday overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.
The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
“[B]y majority of seven namely Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment of July 12 is set aside, as a consequence thereof, Civil Appeal Nos. 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored,” announced Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was presiding over the 12-judge CB hearing the case.
 

Amir Wasim & Ziauddin

Through the March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls — of reserved seats.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of CB, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.
What the decision means
“Practically, the beleaguered PTI is no longer a parliamentary party, therefore the 77 reserved seats — including the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies — will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant,” a senior counsel explained.
Consequently, the ECP will also have to recall its suspension of earlier victory notifications, which it had issued soon after the July 12 judgement.
Of these 77 special seats, 22 seats will be divided amongst different political parties in the National Assembly, of which 19 seats are allocated for women and three for non-Muslims, he explained.
 
 

Of the 22 vacant reserved seats in the National Assembly, 15 will be allocated to PML-N, four to PPP and three to JUI-F, which sits on the opposition benches, he said.
After this process, the ruling coalition will achieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the magic number required to attain a two-thirds majority is 224. PML-N’s tally will rise from 110 to 125, the PPP’s strength will increase from 70 to 74, while the JUI-F will have 11 seats rather than the 8 they currently hold.
As ten judges had allowed the review petitions — seven completely and three partially — the counsel explained, those who had earlier joined the SIC could face the defection clause under Article 63A of the Constitution, if they chose to rejoin PTI after this judgement.
Last-minute recusal
At the outset of Friday’s proceedings, the strength of the 11-judge CB was further reduced to ten when Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself.
During the hearing, while pointing towards senior counsel Hamid Khan, Justice Panhwar observed that he felt personally hurt with the way the counsel had argued. Since the counsel had no faith in him, he had no option but to recuse himself.
With the permission of the chair, Justice Panhwar read out an order he had written, stating that during the proceedings of the reserved seats case, all counsel — including Faisal Siddiqi for SIC and Salman Akram Raja for PTI and Kanwal Shauzab — had expressed confidence in the composition of the bench.
 
 

However, during the previous hearing, senior counsel Hamid Khan had raised an objection targeting the inclusion of certain judges — including Justice Panhwar himself — who were appointed after the passage of the 26th Constitutional amendment.
The counsel has questioned the propriety of our participation in this bench for the adjudication of the present matter, Justice Panhwar observed.
“In the light of the objection raised and in deference to the judicial propriety, irrespective of its merit or the timing of assertion, I considered it appropriate to recuse myself from further hearing of this case,” Justice Panhwar announced, adding that his recusal was not an admission for disqualification, but intended to uphold the institutional integrity and objectivity of these proceedings.
“Greatly appreciate that,” replied Hamid Khan. At this, Justice Khan retorted that it was not a matter of appreciation.
“This is only because of your conduct,” regr­etted Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. The court then retired and assembled later after a considerable time.
The recusal of Justice Panhwar was also noted by the CB in its short order, saying that after he recused himself and contributed a separate note, the bench was reconstituted with all available members of the CB.

• Circular debt crosses Rs4.9tr; unfunded pensions, weak governance deepen fiscal strain
ISLAMABAD: With relentless financial haemorrhaging of nearly Rs342bn in just six months, the cumulative losses and unfunded pension liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have crossed Rs7.5tr — almost three times the country’s defence allocation of Rs2.55tr for FY26, and over seven times the upcoming year’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (Rs1tr).
The Ministry of Finance informed the Cabinet Commit­tee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) on Friday that total SOE losses now exceed Rs5.8tr — nearly one-third of the recently passed Rs17.5tr federal budget for 2025-26.
Presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, the meeting was briefed by the Central Monitoring Unit of the Finance Division on the biannual performance of federal SOEs for the period July to December 2024.
The report outlined the worsening state of SOEs, including cumulative losses of Rs5.8tr, with Rs342bn incurred in just six months.
Despite repeated increases in electricity and gas tariffs over the past three years, circular debt in the oil, gas and power sectors has surged to over Rs4.9tr — almost double the defence budget — severely affecting cash flows and asset valuations.
The committee was told that government fiscal support to SOEs — via grants, subsidies, loans and other injections — also exceeded Rs600bn in just six months, equivalent to nearly 10pc of total revenue receipts.
Unfunded pension liabilities in power distribution companies (Discos) and other SOEs, estimated at Rs1.7tr, remain off the government’s books, as do the pension obligations of Pakistan Railways.
Government guarantees currently stand at Rs2.2tr, while costs related to debt rollovers and financial restructuring further tighten fiscal space. The meeting was informed of persistent governance issues, particularly weak transparency in beneficial interest disclosures under IFRS Section 30, and other regulatory compliance gaps. A lack of strategic alignment and operational inefficiencies were identified as urgent areas for reform.
The cabinet committee noted with concern the staggering Rs5.8tr in cumulative losses, including Rs342bn in just six months — a daily average loss of Rs1.9bn, according to an official statement.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb deplored inefficiencies in Disco operations, delays in grid upgrades by NTDC, and ballooning pension obligations. He warned that weak governance standards are undermining fiscal space and deterring investor confidence.
He stressed the need for urgent reform in the power and energy sectors, where circular debt has crossed Rs4.9tr, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing transparency, financial discipline, and accountability across SOEs.
He vowed to push through governance and operational reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of public sector entities.
Mr Aurangzeb also directed that all government-nominated directors on SOE boards exercise due diligence and actively contribute to improving financial and operational performance through informed decision-making.
Ironically, each SOE board includes at least one senior official from the finance ministry — alongside representatives from relevant line ministries — who receive generous remunerations for attending quarterly board meetings, yet the financial bleeding remains unchecked.
The finance minister underscored the importance of aligning business plans with national priorities and tackling operational challenges in a coordinated and timely fashion. The meeting was also attended by ministers from the ministries of Power, Maritime Affairs, and Science and Technology.
The committee approved the appointment of chairpersons for Quetta Electric and Gujranwala Electric, as well as the constitution of the Board of Directors for the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and an independent director for GENCO Holding Company Ltd (GHCL), as proposed by the Power Division.
It also approved the nomination of independent directors for the boards of Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Power Information Technology Company (PITC), and the formation of the board for Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC).
Additionally, the committee approved a summary from the Ministry of Railways seeking the winding up of three railway subsidiaries — RAILCOP, PRACS, and PRFTC.

• Insists Trump’s Nobel nomination a joint civil-military decision
• Dismisses claim Islamabad sought ceasefire
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar on Friday ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
Speaking at a news conference at the Foreign Office, Mr Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
His comments came in response to recent remarks by US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who suggested that more countries, which were not previously “contemplated”, were preparing to join the US-brokered accords, which normalise ties with Israel.
Witkoff had joined President Donald Trump at the White House lunch for Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Mr Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”
He added that signing the Abraham Accords would be tantamount to abandoning Pakistan’s long-standing demand for a Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders. “Let it be clear to everyone that our seven-decades-long policy rem­ains unchanged,” he said.
Trump’s Nobel nomination
Addressing criticism over Pakistan’s nomination of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Dar said the decision was made jointly by the country’s civilian and military leadership.
He emphasised that the nomination, submitted prior to the start of the Israel-Iran conflict, was based on Trump’s role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakis­tan and his remarks regarding the Kashmir dispute.
The foreign minister recalled that Trump “tweeted 15 or 16 times about that”.
Trump’s repeated cla­i­ms on social media about his role in facilitating the May 10 ceasefire between Pakistan and India have irritated New Delhi.
“The decision to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize was in the context of his role in the India-Pakistan conflict and his statements on the Kashmir issue,” Mr Dar said.
“It was a collective decision by the civil-military leadership. I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”
Mr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.
The nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.
Indian ceasefire claims
Responding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.
“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.
“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”
His remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.

• Opposition disrupts proceedings by chanting slogans against govt, in support of Imran Khan
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly witnessed a rumpus once again on Friday, as the lower house wrapped up budget formalities, while the speaker asserted his right to expunge remarks he deemed to be against the “national interest”.
On Friday, the House approved all supplementary grants pertaining to different ministries and divisions for the years 2023-24 and 2024-25.
Excess demands for grants for the financial year 2023-24, which were moved by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, were also approved.
During the approval process, opposition lawmakers continuously chanted full-throated slogans against the government and the upcoming fiscal year’s budget, as well as in support of their jailed leader, Imran Khan.
They gathered in front of the speaker’s dais, raising slogans and tearing up copies of the agenda. However, the government benches responded to opposition slogans with equal force.
Unmoved by the uproar, the finance minister continued to present demands for supplementary grants, which were passed before the House was abruptly prorogued.
The opposition members also staged a brief walkout from the House but soon returned to continue their protest.
Speaking in the House, Mr Aurangzeb praised members from both sides of the aisle for their active participation and valuable input in the federal budget process for the fiscal year 2025-26.
He noted that contributions, and constructive feedback from both the treasury and opposition benches played a vital role in the successful completion of the budget process. He appreciated them for openly expressing their views during the debate, describing it as a hallmark of democratic culture.
Speaker asserts his right
The episode began right at the outset of proceedings, when Leader of the Opposition in House Omar Ayub Khan got into an argument with Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
The opposition leader drew the speaker’s attention towards Rule 284 and asked him as to who had expunged his speech from a day earlier.
When the speaker claimed that he had expunged the speech, Mr. Ayub confronted him, saying, “When did you do it? I saw your cars leaving myself?” Mr Ayub said that what was happening had never occurred in the past. “No Speaker has ever done this before,” he added, referring to the policy of censorship and blackout.
“I have to look at the national interest. I will do what is in the national interest and will keep on doing it”, the speaker said. The opposition leader replied it was about amendments and there was nothing against national interest. He also raised the issue of what he called unreasonable remarks against former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse made by the law minister. “Otherwise, it would lead to a situation where we will be at each other’s throats, and you will be responsible for it,” he warned the NA speaker.

Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, who were elected as independents, while 25 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims were vacant due to the cases pending before the apex court.
After the increase in their stre­ngth, the opposition members will be in a position to requisition assembly sessions. So far, they did not have sufficient numbers for the purpose.
Friday’s judgement restored several March 2024 notifications of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to declare 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to rese­rved seats in the provincial assembly.
On May 13, 2024, the ECP had suspended several notifications, declaring MNAs and MPAs as returned on reserved seats, in light of an earlier order of the Supreme Court.
Through those notifications, 21 of the MPAs elected on seats reserved for women and four MPAs elected on seats reserved for non-Muslims were suspended.
The suspended MPAs-elect included eight from the JUI-F, six from the PML-N, five from PPP and one each from Awami National Party and Pervez Khattak’s PTI-Parliamentarians.
Similarly, out of the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, two were allocated to the JUI-F and one each to the PML-N and PPP.
Presently, out of 27 opposition MPAs, nine each belong to the JUI-F and the PML-N, five to PPP and two to each ANP and PTI-P.
Following the latest SC decision, the strength of the opposition will include 19 from the JUI-F, 16 of the PML-N, 11 from the PPP and three each from the ANP and PTI-P.
After the Feb 2024 general elections, the ECP issued a notification on Feb 22, 2024, about allocation of five of the total 26 seats reserved for women in the provincial assembly. Those five MPAs included two of JUI-F and PML-N each and one of PPP.
The ECP had not allocated the remaining seats to any other party as it had not decided the fate of Sunni Ittehad Council, which was joined by 87 of the PTI-backed independent MPAs.
Apart from the provincial assembly, the eight MNAs elected on reserved seats for women from KP also stood restored. These MNAs include four from PML-N, and two each from JUI-F and PPP.
Above all Senate elections have yet to be conducted in the province.

Mahrang Baloch, along with other BYC leaders — Beebow Baloch, her father Ghaffar Baloch, Sabghat Ullah Shah Jee and Bebarg Baloch — was arrested on March 22 and sent to Quetta District Jail under MPO-3.
This marks the fourth extension of their detention. After completing three months in custody, the authorities issued a fresh notification extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Superintendent of Que­tta District Jail Ham­eed Ullah Peechi confirmed the extension. “I have rec­eived orders from the authorities concerned about extending the detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch and others by 15 more days. They will remain in jail for 15 more days,” he said.
The BYC spokesperson strongly criticised the provincial government for the repeated extensions and termed the fresh orders illegal. He dema­nded the immediate release of all detained leaders.
 
 

Dr Sabhia Baloch, a BYC leader, said: “The continued detention of these leaders after three months is illegal and unconstitutional.” She accused the government of using various tactics to prolong their imprisonment and demanded their immediate release.
Ms Baloch and over 150 other political workers were arrested on March 22 from a sit-in camp near the University of Balochistan. The protest had been organised to demand the handover of the bodies of individuals allegedly killed in a security forces operation against suspects involved in the attack and hijacking of the Jaffar Express in Bolan.
 
 

The Home Department withdrew the arrest orders for the other detainees and released them. However, detention orders for Ms Baloch and the four other BYC leaders were not withdrawn.

A notification issued by the interior ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said the approval followed requests by all provincial governments, besides governments of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
It added the federal government authorised the deployment of army troops and civil armed forces under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, for Muharram security duties in aid of civil power, subject to laws enforced in the country.
“The exact number, date and area of deployment of Pakistan Army and CAFs troops/assets will be worked out by all provincial governments including Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Govt. of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and ICT administration in consultation with concerned stakeholders on the basis of on-ground requirement/assessment.

Deployment approved on requests from provinces, GB and Azad Kashmir

“The date of de-requisitioning of the said deployment will be decided subsequently after mutual consultation among all stakeholders,” the notification said.
Copies of the notification besides others have been sent to the secretary to the prime minister, secretary of ministry of defence, secretaries of home departments, governments of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB & AJK, chief commissioner of ICT, military operations directorate, GHQ, inspectors general of Frontier Corps, (North and South), inspectors general of Frontier Corps, Balochistan (North and South), director generals of Pakistan Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), commandant of Frontier Constabulary, director general of Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, and inspectors general of Police, Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB, AJK and Islamabad.
Ashura, the 10th of Muharram, will be observed on July 6. Muharram is the month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where Imam Hussain, the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), and his family members and companions were martyred.
Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.
A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting on nationwide Muharram security plan at the Ministry of Interior.
During the meeting, security plans for all provinces, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad were reviewed in detail.
It was decided in the meeting to launch a crackdown against elements spreading religious hatred on social media during Muharram and take strict legal action against them.
Moreover, it was decided to send clear recommendations to Pemra and PTA to curb hate content on electronic and social media. It was also decided that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure peace and order during Muharram.
It was also agreed that any decision to suspend internet or mobile phone services will be made in consultation with provinces, keeping in view the security concerns.
Mr Naqvi directed the authorities to make decisions regarding internet and mobile service suspensions the basis of ground realities and the security situation.

• Committee approves supplementary grants worth Rs856bn; passes the buck on sugar import to minister-led body
ISLAMABAD: The government has increased the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.
The rate for non-domestic consumers has been increased by 29pc to cumulatively raise an additional Rs72 billion.
The ECC meeting on Friday, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved supplementary grants of Rs856bn.
However, the committee failed to reach a decision over the import of sugar and passed the responsibility to a political committee led by the National Food Security and Research minister.
Increase in gas price
The summary for the revised natural gas pricing structure for the fiscal year 2025–26 was moved by the Petroleum Division.
The ministry sought app­roval for up to 56pc increase in gas rates for protected domestic consumers and 37pc increase in fixed charges.
The additional burden on consumers was to be offset by disbursing the amount —saved due to the removal of subsidy — through the BISP social safety programme.
However, the ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
The increase in gas rate for the power sector would have around Rs0.12 per unit additional impact on the average power tariff.
In doing so, the ECC increased fixed charges for protected consumers by 50pc from Rs400 to Rs600.
Likewise, fixed charges for non-protected domestic consumers were increased by 50pc from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500.
The meeting also abolished the one-slab benefit to domestic consumers — both protected and non-protected — who would now be charged at the first tariff slab of each category.
The ECC also increased gas rates for bulk consumers by 9.5pc from Rs2,900 to Rs3,175 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).
The gas rates for the power sector were increased by 29pc instead of 25pc proposed by the Petroleum Division from Rs1,050 to Rs1,350 per mmBtu.
Likewise, a 9.3pc increase was approved for industrial (process) consumers from Rs2,150 to Rs2,350 per mmBtu.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance said the Ogra law required the federal government to notify revised consumer gas prices within 40 days of Ogra’s determination to ensure cost recovery and regulatory compliance.
“The submission also aligns with structural benchmarks agreed with the IMF, including rationalisation of captive power tariffs and a shift from cross-subsidies to direct, targeted support for low-income consumers,” it added.
The statement said the ECC decided to maintain gas prices to protect household consumers with only fixed charges re-adjusted to recover the asset costs.
“It also allowed price of gas for bulk consumers, power plants operating on natural gas and industry to be increased by an average value of around 10pc,” the statement said.
This would ensure the revenue requirement of Rs888.6bn — Rs534.46bn for SNGPL and Rs354.2bn for SSGCL — determined by Ogra for FY26.
At the existing price of gas effective since February 01, the estimated revenues of both Sui companies by the end FY26 was Rs847.714bn — Rs493.54bn for SNGPL and Rs354.18bn for SSGCL, leaving a shortfall of Rs41bn.
The gas tariff revisions cleared by the ECC are assumed to meet the Rs41bn revenue deficit.
The petroleum division warned that the government was already engaged with the IMF to replace cross-subsidies with direct, budgeted subsidies, i.e., through the BISP.
Sugar import
The ECC also discussed the issue of sugar imports to stabilise prices in the local market and constituted a 10-member steering committee for further deliberations.
The committee, led by the food security minister, also included the commerce minister, SAPM on foreign affairs, Finance Division secretary, FBR chairman and others will submit its recommendations to the ECC.
The ECC also discussed proposed changes in the home remittances incentive schemes and asked the State Bank of Pakistan and the Finance Division to propose and present a plan by July 31.
The meeting considered a finance ministry’s proposal to launch a risk coverage scheme for small farmers and under-served areas and gave an in-principle approval to the scheme.
The ECC noted the scheme was likely to bring 750,000 new agricultural borrowers into the formal financial system and generate an incremental credit portfolio of Rs300bn during its disbursement tenure of three years.
The meeting approved a total of 14 supplementary grants worth Rs856bn.
Major among them included Rs832bn to the Ministry of Finance for repayment of debt, Rs15.84bn for the Ministry of Defence to cover the shortfall in admissible pay and allowances, in employees-related and non-employees related expenditures and clear the outstanding dues as part of the PM’s Package for the martyrs of the recent clashed with India and Rs5.5bn grant to Strategic Plans Divisions as rupee cover to Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission.

• Islamabad welcomes, India rejects ‘supplemental award’ as it exposes Kishenganga and Ratle hydel projects to Pakistan’s objections
ISLAMABAD: In a major boon for Pakistan in its dispute over the ‘one-sided’ suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague has ruled that India’s actions have no bearing on its competence to adjudicate the matter.
The court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterised as a suspension of the treaty, or otherwise.
The court further found that it has a continuing responsibility to advance proceedings in a timely, efficient and fair manner, notwithstanding India’s position on “abeyance”.
It also declared that these findings also apply to the Neutral Expert, appointed in separate proceedings.
The decision, which was hailed by Islamabad and “rejected by New Delhi, marks a major legal win for Pakistan. At the heart of the decision is a clear message that India cannot unilaterally suspend or sideline the treaty.
 
 

The court based its ruling firmly on the treaty’s text, especially Article XII(4), which says the treaty stays in force unless both countries agree to end it through a formal agreement. This leaves no room for one side to walk away or put the treaty on pause. This is consistent with the provisions of international law, particularly the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept).
The ruling also emphasises the importance of the treaty’s built-in dispute resolution system. According to the court, letting one country unilaterally ignore the arbitration process would undermine the treaty’s very purpose. This reflects the principle that treaties should be interpreted in a way that gives their provisions real meaning and effect.
Crucially, the court has rejected India’s claim that it could simply pull out of the proceedings and halt arbitration. It has also reaffirmed its own authority to decide on its jurisdiction, pointing out that once the process has started, it can’t be disrupted by one party backing out.
‘Supplemental award’
Friday’s decision by The Hague-based Court of Arbitr­ation was a ‘Supplemental Award on the Competence of the Court’ in a matter initiated by Pakistan.
In these proceedings, Pakistan had requested the court to address the interpretation and application of IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric projects (Kishen­ganga and Ratle) that India was permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, before those rivers flow into Pakistan.
In the unanimous decision, the court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of the arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterized under international law as a suspension of the treaty or otherwise.
Pakistan had initiated the present arbitral proceedings in 2016. Subsequently, India reques­ted that the World Bank appoint a neutral expert (a highly-qualified engineer) to address certain design and operation questions that were essentially identical to some of the questions presented by Pakistan in its request for arbitration.
In December 2016, the World Bank, which has a special but essentially ministerial role under the Treaty, decided to “pause” the process of appointing the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration and the Neutral Expert. This pause was lifted in 2022, following which the Court of Arbitration was empaneled and the neutral expert was appointed.
On July 6, 2023, the Court issued its Award on the Competence of the Court, in which the court carefully considered objections to the competence of the Court raised by India (by way of correspondence to the World Bank).
In a unanimous decision, the court rejected each of the objections raised by India and determined that the court is competent to consider and determine the disputes set forth in Pakis­tan’s request for arbitration.
The court then recalled the well-settled rule of customary international law that events occurring after the initiation of proceedings can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the relevant court or tribunal.
This rule, reflected in decisions of the International Court of Justice and international arbitral tribunals, confirmed the Court’s conclusion that, once established, the court’s jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a party’s unilateral action.
Applying these findings to India’s decision that the “Indus Waters Treaty 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect”, the court found that it was not open to India to take unilateral action to suspend these proceedings, regardless of how India’s position was characterized or justified under international law.
Reactions from Islamabad, New Delhi
The government of Pakistan noted that the court had affirmed its competence in the light of recent developments, and that unilateral action by India cannot deprive either the court or the Neutral Expert, in the proceedings initiated by India, of their competence to adjudicate the issues before them.
Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the First Phase on the Merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024, a statement said.
The high priority, at this point, the statement said, was that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
 
 

It recalled that to this end, PM Shehbaz Sharif had stated on June 24, 2025 that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu & Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.”
Meanwhile, India “categorically rejected” the supplemental award by the Court of Arbitration on its Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, saying that it “never recognised” the Court of Arbitration.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said.
“Today, the illegal Court of Arbitration, purportedly constituted under the Indus Waters Treaty 1960, albeit in brazen violation of it, has issued what it characterises as a “supplemental award” on its competence concerning the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.”
The MEA described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.
 
 

“Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under the Treaty. No Court of Arbitration, much less this illegally constituted arbitral body, which has no existence in the eye of law, has the jurisdiction to examine the legality of India’s actions in exercise of its rights as a sovereign,” it said.
