According to an NCCIA notification, three officers — Deputy Director Sarfaraz Chaudhry, Assistant Director Muhammad Usman, and Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz — resigned from their posts, and their resignations were accepted by the Interior Ministry. “This is to inform that the following officers are relieved from the NCCIA from the date of approval of their resignations — Nov 20.”
Another official, Assistant Director Asma Majeed, also resigned from her post.
A mega scam involving the misuse of authority and acceptance of bribes from different suspects rocked the NCCIA in October.
Not only were nine officials of the NCCIA booked in Lahore, but also 12 in Islamabad, for allegedly taking large sums of money from individuals and call centres.
An internal inquiry found the nine NCCIA accused of operating as a network, taking monthly cash bribes to “facilitate call centres, aggregator companies and individuals involved in online fraud”.
Even investigation is underway regarding the role of some of the suspects being part of the “blasphemy gang” that would frame individuals.
Although only three NCCIA officers named in this scam have resigned so far, sources believe that all 20 or so suspected officials may be fired from the organisation, which was established in May last year.
On the other hand, the FIA, which is probing Sarfaraz Chaudhry and others, has yet to complete its investigation, raising questions about whether it is trying to “save” its former employees. Before the establishment of the NCCIA, these officials were part of the FIA Cyber Crime unit.
“All nine suspects are in jail, and no extensive interrogation has been conducted on them,” a source claimed. “FIA investigators have yet to complete the challan/investigation to submit in court.”
When asked why the FIA had failed to expedite the probe against them, a spokesperson told Dawn that “the matter is under probe.”
Nine NCCIA officers — Additional Director Sarfraz (Lahore); Deputy Directors Muhammad Zawar Ahmad, Muhammad Usman and Ayaz Khan; Assistant Directors Shoaib Riaz and Mujtaba Zafar; Inspector Salman Aziz; and Sub-inspectors Ali Raza and Yasir Ramzan — are accused of accepting bribes and abusing authority in a case against YouTuber Saad ur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai, over the alleged promotion of gambling apps on social media and through various call centres.
Ducky Bhai also recently disclosed about the “brutal torture” Sarfraz Chaudhry unleashed on him in NCCIA custody.
The YouTuber’s wife Aroob Jatoi, had accused the officials, especially Sarfraz, of taking over Rs100 million, both in local and foreign currency.
According to the First Information Report registered against the officials under Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants, the accused allegedly kept their own shares and distributed the remaining proceeds among other members of the “official gang.”
Sources said the anti-cyber crime body appeared to have “become part of the problem rather than curbing it.” There were also complaints about the exploitation of women victims by some elements within the NCCIA.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1720325533b3cb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961672/pti-decides-to-contest-islamabad-local-govt-elections-despite-rigging-fears' target='_blank'><strong>PTI decides to contest Islamabad local govt elections despite ‘rigging’ fears</strong></a><br><p>Despite fear of rigging, the PTI decided on Wednesday to participate in the Islamabad local government elections, which will be held on February 15 across the federal capital.
In line with party policy, workers who have remained loyal to the party and its ideology and have made sacrifices during the last three years will be given priority in nominations.
The decision was made during a meeting chaired by PTI Islamabad Region President Aamir Mughal and attended by Regional Secretary and Chairman of the Local Government Committee Malik Aamir Ali Awan, ticket holder Advocate Shoaib Shaheen, Senator Fauzia Arshad, Senate ticket holder Syed Farzand Shah, ticket holder Ali Bukhari, and other senior office-bearers.
After consultations, it was unanimously decided that PTI’s Islamabad wing would take part in the local government elections. However, participants feared that there could be “rigging,” as happened in the recent National Assembly elections in Haripur.
Participants were also of the view that the government had amended the 2015 Local Government Act and abolished the direct election of chairman and vice chairman to “facilitate rigging and horse-trading”, thereby undermining the public mandate. However, they said that the party would contest the local government elections with full strength and aims to achieve a clean sweep across the district.
It was decided that under the leadership of Aamir, a local government committee comprising district presidents, general secretaries, heads of all wings, ticket holders, and senior members would be formed at the earliest. Moreover, an election manifesto would be prepared, and a campaign team would be formed.
It was also decided that a legal team would be established under the committee to oversee election campaigns, the scrutiny and submission of nomination papers, and to handle all other legal matters.
It was decided that Regional President Mughal, in consultation with the leaders of all three constituencies and senior members, would form a parliamentary board to monitor ticket awarding.
Talking to Dawn, Mughal said, despite weak, flawed and “rigging-promoting amendments”, under which the local government elections are being conducted, the PTI will sweep the elections just as it did during the 2024 general elections.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced the schedule for local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory. The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to new legislation.
In a notification also posted to social media, the ECP called on voters in the ICT to elect their representatives to the general seats of union councils. It set Dec 19 as the date for public notice inviting nomination papers to be issued by the returning officers (ROs), while Dec 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on Dec 25) as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.
The names of the nominated candidates will be published on Dec 29, and the nomination papers will be scrutinised by the ROs from Dec 30 to Jan 3, 2026. From Jan 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from Jan 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on the 14.
Jan 15 marks the final day of withdrawal of candidature, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published. The polling day will take place after 29 days on Sunday, Feb 15, with the results being consolidated between the 16 and 19 of the month. The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17195829ad79b9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961668/imrans-sisters-among-400-booked-over-pti-adiala-sit-in-at-least-14-party-supporters-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sisters among 400 booked over PTI Adiala sit-in; at least 14 party supporters arrested</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — are among 400 people booked on Wednesday after police dispersed a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where the party founder and former prime minister is currently incarcerated.
Moreover, 14 PTI workers were arrested and produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) today, which approved three days of physical remand and returned the suspects to police custody.
Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka a day prior, demanding their court-mandated Tuesday meeting with the PTI founder. Police used water cannons and baton charges to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am.
According to a copy of the first information report (FIR) — dated December 17 and available with Dawn — 400 suspects, including 35 nominated persons, were booked under various provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (ATA) and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), including the use of petrol bombs and violating Section 144 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC), which prohibits public gatherings.
The nominated suspects include Imran’s sisters, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, PTI leader Aliya Hamza and PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta, among others.
The 400 suspects have been booked under the following provisions:

Section 7 of the ATA — terrorism
Section 21(I) of the ATA — aid and abetment
Section 109 of the PPC — punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment
Section 120B of the PPC — punishment of criminal conspiracy
Section 147 of the PPC — punishment for rioting
Section 149 of the PPC — every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object
Section 186 of the PPC — obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions
Section 188 of the PPC — disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant
Section 285 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter
Section 286 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance
Section 324 of the PPC — attempted murder
Section 341 of the PPC — punishment for wrongful restraint
Section 353 of the PPC — assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty
Section 440 of the PPC — mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt

‘Panic and moral bankruptcy’
The PTI condemned the cases filed against the participants of the sit-in and assailed the Punjab Police for using “chemical-laced” water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers.
In a strongly worded statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party lashed out at the government for employing force against sit-in participants and subjecting women, senior citizens and non-violent protesters to water cannons and physical violence.
The party also deemed the forcible arrest of multiple workers “the worst manifestation of political victimisation” and denounced the use of the ATA against the participants, stating that all of these actions reflected “a fearful government’s panic and moral bankruptcy”.
Weaponising the law to target citizens and peaceful political activists was also slammed as an attack on democracy, justice and fundamental human rights.
The PTI also flayed the government for deliberately, systematically and repeatedly obstructing the legally mandated bi-weekly meetings of the PTI founder with his family, lawyers and friends, “effectively reducing the court’s clear orders to mere scraps of paper”.
The party asserted that the federal government was blatantly violating the Islamabad High Court’s orders and setting a dangerous precedent, as these actions were not administrative failures and instead “constituted a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and the authority of the judiciary”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17191240d395cd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961666/fingerprints-are-piling-up-sherry-rehman-says-fatf-should-investigate-growing-support-for-terrorism-from-india' target='_blank'><strong>‘Fingerprints are piling up’: Sherry Rehman says FATF should investigate ‘growing support’ for terrorism from India</strong></a><br><p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday suggested that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) investigate “growing support” from India for terrorist groups, after an Indian national was identified as a suspect in a recent mass shooting at Australia’s Bondi Beach.
Alleged father-and-son perpetrators, Sajid and Naveed Akram, opened fire on a Jewish holiday celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism.
Sajid, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”.
In a post on X, Senator Rehman noted that the attack raised questions about links to New Delhi as Indian and Israeli allegations of Pakistani involvement “were backfiring at warp speed”.
“Perhaps the FATF should also look into growing support from India for terrorist groups operating internationally. The fingerprints are piling up,” she wrote, tagging the anti-terror financing watchdog.







She further wrote that though the suspects were Muslims, the man who disarmed one of the alleged attackers was himself a Muslim immigrant and hailed as a hero by Australian authorities.
“The Bondi attack is also being scaffolded away from its purported intent to terrorise per se, as an identity politics issue,” the senator’s post read.
“It must also be remembered that the many phobias, including a vicious streak of Islamophobia, generated in the wake of this heinous attack, are plain wrong. It is wrong to attack innocent people on any strip of beach or faith, whether that be Bondi or Gaza.”
Earlier today, Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said.
New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges.
“Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.
Furthermore, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-12-17 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1719323334ad768.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961667/amnesty-condemns-repeated-use-of-water-cannons-on-pti-protesters-outside-adiala-prison' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty condemns ‘repeated’ use of water cannons on PTI protesters outside Adiala Prison</strong></a><br><p>Amnesty International on Wednesday condemned the “repeated” use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities to disperse a sit-in outside Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, after incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family was denied a meeting with the former prime minister.
“The repeated use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities against peaceful protesters outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi is a flagrant violation of their right to peaceful assembly.”
Amnesty added that Pakistan authorities “must respect people’s right to peacefully protest and end the disproportionate and punitive use of force”.







After authorities again barred Imran’s sisters from meeting the incarcerated former prime minister, a sit-in was staged outside the prison.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in, which was later dispersed with water cannons.
Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2 am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained.
Some of the party workers were arrested, but the number could not be confirmed.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters.</p><small>2025-12-17 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17182815943b89b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961663/pakistan-navys-fourth-hangor-class-submarine-launched-by-chinese-shipyard' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy’s fourth Hangor class submarine launched by Chinese shipyard</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy’s fourth Hangor-class submarine, named Ghazi, was launched at Shuangliu Base in Wuhan, China, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced on Wednesday.
With the Ghazi’s launch, the ISPR hailed “another significant milestone” by the navy, where all four submarines being built in China are currently undergoing “rigorous sea trials and are in the final stages of being handed over to Pakistan”.
“The Government of Pakistan signed an agreement with China for [the] acquisition of eight Hangor-class submarines. Under this contract, four submarines are being built in China and [the] remaining four will be constructed in Pakistan by Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd (KS&EW), under Transfer of Technology (ToT),” the ISPR said in a statement.
The military’s media wing added that the submarines will be fitted with advanced weaponry and sensors capable of engaging targets at standoff ranges.
“Hangor-class submarines will be pivotal in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement read, adding that the launch ceremony was attended by senior officials from China and Pakistan, exemplifying deepening bilateral cooperation.
The navy launched the first of the new submarines in April 2024, while the second and third were launched on March 15 and August 15 this year, respectively.
The submarine class, named after the PNS Hangor, is a diesel-electric attack submarine with air-independent propulsion technology, which allows it to travel over greater distances before resurfacing.
During the 1971 Pakistan-India war, the then-PNS Hangor became the first submarine to sink a warship after World War II, sinking an Indian frigate. After being decommissioned, the Hangor is now on display at the Pakistan Maritime Museum in Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1718005853f6b3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961660/warner-bros-discovery-board-rejects-rival-bid-from-paramount' target='_blank'><strong>Warner Bros Discovery board rejects rival bid from Paramount</strong></a><br><p>Warner Bros Discovery’s board rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108.4 billion hostile bid on Wednesday, saying it failed to provide adequate financing assurances.
In a letter to shareholders, disclosed in a regulatory filing, the board wrote that Paramount had “consistently misled” Warner Bros shareholders that its $30-per-share cash offer was fully guaranteed, or “backstopped,” by the Ellison family, led by billionaire and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.
“It does not, and never has,” the board wrote of the guarantee of Paramount’s offer, noting that the offer posed “numerous, significant risks.”
Warner Bros’ board said it found Paramount’s offer “inferior” to the merger agreement with Netflix’s. The streaming giant’s $27.75 per share offer for Warner Bros’ film and television studios, its library and the HBO Max streaming service is a binding agreement that requires no equity financing and has robust debt commitments, the board wrote.
Warner Bros has not yet set a date for a shareholder vote on the deal but it is expected to happen sometime in spring or early summer, its Chairman Samuel Di Piazza said in an interview with CNBC.
Paramount did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Netflix welcomed the move.
“The Warner Bros Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” its co-CEO Ted Sarandos, said in a statement.
Warner Bros shares were down 1.4% at $28.5 in premarket trading, while Netflix gained 1.5% and Paramount fell 1.8%.
Paramount last week took its case directly to Warner Bros shareholders, arguing it has arranged “air-tight financing” to support its bid, with $41 billion in new equity assured by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital, and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.
Warner Bros board countered on Wednesday that Paramount’s most recent offer includes an equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind,” but rather the backing of “an unknown and opaque” Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, whose assets and liabilities are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change.
“Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was…the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” the Warner Bros board wrote. “A revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.”
Warner Bros questions Paramount’s creditworthiness
Paramount has submitted a total of six bids to acquire the entire Warner Bros studio, including its television networks, including CNN and TNT Sports.
It has previously said the Ellison family trust - which Paramount says contains more than $250 billion in assets including about 1.16 billion shares of Oracle - is more than adequate to cover the equity commitment.
“To suggest that we are not ‘good for the money’ (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd,” Paramount wrote in a letter to Warner Bros’ shareholders last week. Its debt commitments are not conditioned on Paramount’s financial condition, it wrote.
Warner Bros, however, pointed in the filing Wednesday to what it described as structural risks in Paramount’s proposed financing, and also raised questions about Paramount’s financial condition and creditworthiness.
The offer relied on a seven-party, cross-conditional structure, with the Ellison Revocable Trust providing just 32% of the required equity commitment while capping its liability at $2.8 billion, Warner Bros said. It noted that the trust’s assets could be withdrawn at any time.
Debt levels after deal with Paramount will be risky
Netflix’s offer is backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet, the Warner board noted.
The company has told Warner Bros it would keep releasing the studio’s films in cinemas in a bid to ease fears that its deal would eliminate another studio and major source of theatrical films, according to people familiar with the matter.
Paramount, by contrast, has a $15 billion market capitalization and a credit rating “a notch above ‘junk,’ Warner Bros noted on Wednesday. Should the deal close, Paramount would have a debt ratio of 6.8 times its operating income “with virtually no current free cash flow.”
The bidder would also impose what Warner Bros said would be “onerous operating restrictions” on the company, during the potentially lengthy period between signing and closing, including limits on new content licensing deals.
Paramount’s plans to achieve $9 billion in “synergies” across the two studios was described as “ambitious” from an operational standpoint, the Warner Bros board noted, and would represent a new round of job losses that “would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.”
Warner Bros Discovery’s board dismissed Paramount’s charges of unfairness - that had been set forth in a filing by Paramount last week - saying it held “dozens” of calls and meetings with the studio’s principals and advisors, including four in-person meetings and meals with CEO David Zaslav and Paramount CEO David Ellison, or his father, Larry Ellison.
“After each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions,” the Warner Bros board wrote. “Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.”
Paramount said it has already applied for regulatory approval in the United States, and has alerted European regulators, shortening the path to regulatory approval.
Warner Bros Discovery’s board wrote that it considered the regulatory risks in evaluating the Netflix and Paramount offers, and believes that either transaction would obtain the necessary US and foreign regulatory approvals.
Netflix also offered a $5.8 billion break-up fee that was higher than Paramount’s $5 billion break-up fee.
The Warner Bros Discovery board also described the Paramount offer as “illusory,” adding that it could be terminated or amended at any time prior to the deal’s completion, which is not the same as a binding merger agreement.
“The PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders,” the board wrote.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171830561eeec8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961662/world-number-one-alcaraz-announces-difficult-split-with-coach-ferrero' target='_blank'><strong>World number one Alcaraz announces ‘difficult’ split with coach Ferrero</strong></a><br><p>Men’s tennis world number one Carlos Alcaraz announced on Wednesday he is splitting from his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after seven hugely successful years together.
Alcaraz has won six Grand Slams among his 24 tour level titles under the guidance of fellow Spaniad Ferrero, including this year’s French and US Opens.
Alcaraz, 22, ends this year as world number one having claimed eight tournaments during the season including his dramatic victory over Jannik Sinner in Paris.
“It is very difficult to write this post,” Alcaraz said on social media with photos of the pair hugging.

         View this post on Instagram            

“After more than seven years together, ‘Juanki’ and I have decided to end our story together as coach and player.
“Thank you for making the dreams of a child become reality,” Alcaraz added.
Alcaraz began working with 45-year-old Ferrero, a former world number one, in August 2018, when he was a teenager.
As a player, Ferrero won the 2003 French Open and was runner-up in New York later in the year before becoming a coach working alongside Alexander Zverev in 2017.
Alcaraz won his first Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows in 2022 before clinching Wimbledon and the French Open, to mark a change in men’s tennis following years of dominance by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
His first success at New York sent the then 19-year-old to the top of the world rankings for the first time, becoming the second youngest man to do so, behind Lew Hoad in 1953.
‘Nostalgia’
Alacaraz has never made it further than the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, with the main draw of the first Grand Slam of next year starting on January 18.
“We started this journey when I was barely a kid, and throughout all this time you’ve been by my side on an incredible ride, on and off the court,” Alcaraz said.
“And I’ve enjoyed every step with you immensely.
“Now change is coming for both of us, new adventures and new projects.

“I’m at peace knowing we left everything out there, that we gave everything for one another.”

Alcaraz did not mention who would succeed Ferrero but according to Spanish press, assistant coach Samuel Lopez will take over.
Lopez, 55, took on his current role with Alcaraz in 2024.
Ferrero and Lopez won the 2025 ATP coach of the year award, having also secured the title three years earlier.
“Today, a very important chapter of my life comes to an end,” Ferrero said on Instagram.
“I close it with nostalgia, but also with pride and excitement for what may come next.
“I wish I could have continued. I am convinced that good memories and good people always find a way to cross paths again,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17180154d2acfb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961659/delhi-restricts-vehicles-office-attendance-in-bid-to-curb-pollution' target='_blank'><strong>Delhi restricts vehicles, office attendance in bid to curb pollution</strong></a><br><p>Authorities in India’s capital Delhi rolled out strict measures on Wednesday in an attempt to curb pollution, including a ban on vehicles not compliant with latest emission control norms and regulating attendance in private and government offices.
The air quality index in the Delhi region, home to 30 million people, has been in the “severe” category for the past few days, often crossing the 450-mark. In addition, shallow fog in parts of the city worsened visibility that affected flights and trains.
This prompted the Commission for Air Quality Management to invoke stage four, the highest level, of the graded response action plan for Delhi and surrounding areas on Saturday.
The curbs ban the entry of older diesel trucks into the city, suspend construction, including on public projects, and impose hybrid schooling.

Kapil Mishra, a minister in the local government, announced on Wednesday that all private and government offices in the city would operate with 50% attendance, with the remainder working from home, apart from some exceptions.
Additionally, all registered construction workers, many of them earning daily wages, would be given compensation of 10,000 rupees ($110) because of the ban, Mishra said at a press conference in Delhi.
India’s Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav directed authorities to ensure construction and demolition activities in Delhi and its suburbs were permitted only if proper waste handling infrastructure was available.

To better regulate traffic, the minister directed the removal of illegal encroachments and creation of corridors for smooth movement during peak traffic hours.
On Tuesday, the government enforced strict anti-pollution measures for vehicles in the city, banning vehicles that are not compliant with the latest emission control standards.
“Our government is committed to providing clean air in Delhi. We will take strict steps to ensure this in the coming days,” Delhi’s Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said late on Tuesday.
Pollution is an annual winter problem in Delhi and its suburbs, when cold, dense air traps emissions from vehicles, construction sites and crop burning in neighbouring states, pushing pollution levels to among the highest in the world and exposing residents to severe respiratory risks.
The area gets covered in a thick layer of smog with the AQI touching levels in the high 450s. Readings below 50 are considered good.</p><small>2025-12-17 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171621533f4ea57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655/51000-passengers-offloaded-after-failing-immigration-checks-this-year-fia-tells-na-panel' target='_blank'><strong>51,000 passengers offloaded after failing immigration checks this year, FIA tells NA panel</strong></a><br><p>A meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, chaired by Aga Rafiullah, was informed on Wednesday that 51,000 passengers were offloaded at Pakistani airports this year after failing immigration checks, with a large number of them being offloaded at Lahore and Karachi airports.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.
Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar Raja informed the committee that, “Passengers are offloaded on the basis of document verification, data checks, and online authentication.”
Raja told the parliamentary panel that of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year, 51,000 were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.
He added that many of those offloaded lacked complete information related to their courses, universities or employment details abroad.
“In many cases, passengers attempt to travel through agents using incomplete or incorrect information,” DG FIA added.
The committee was further informed that 180 FIA officials involved in corruption had been dismissed from service, while all major airports had been connected to NADRA’s online database to strengthen immigration controls.
“No passenger was cleared under political influence or VIP pressure,” he stressed.
The official further informed the lawmakers that cameras have been installed at immigration counters at airports and that monitoring is being carried out from the control headquarters.
“The immigration system is using artificial intelligence to identify suspicious cases in advance.”
He added that most offloaded passengers belonged to the visit, Umrah and work visa categories. During the current year, 8.5 million people travelled abroad from Pakistan, while 226 cases were registered for various offences.
“Over the past three months, 450 people were arrested while attempting to cross into Iran illegally,” the DG FIA told the committee.
He also revealed that several Bangladeshi nationals were found attempting to travel illegally to Europe via Pakistan.
“Bangladeshi citizens travelling on Pakistani tourist visas were caught while heading to Europe,” added DG FIA.
He further stated that 287 people were deported last year and 170 this year over the use of fake documents.
The parliamentary panel was also told that 24,000 accused of begging have been deported from Saudi Arabia this year.
$1 trillion investment coming to Saudi Arabia; opportunities to increase for Pakistanis
Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry informed the committee that investment worth $1 trillion is coming to Saudi Arabia under Saudi Vision 2030, creating multiple employment opportunities.
“If we can provide better training to skilled manpower, Pakistan can benefit from these opportunities,” he added.
The secretary told the committee that 451,000 Pakistanis travelled to Saudi Arabia last year, while more than 500,000 Pakistanis have been sent to Saudi Arabia during the current year.
Chairman of the committee Agha Rafiullah said that the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission was “not functioning at all”, adding that officers posted there were temporarily fixing matters instead of resolving them permanently.
Committee member Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry said drivers have been provided to community welfare attachés, questioning how Grade 17–18 officers were being assigned drivers in Europe.
He said “more than 50 per cent of community welfare attachés have been provided drivers”, asking whether the ministry was aware of the cost of providing a driver to a Grade 17 officer in Europe.
Community welfare attachés are officials of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, posted abroad to assist Pakistani migrant workers, safeguard their interests, and provide legal or financial protection.
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “no passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.
“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.
In November, the FIA clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
The same day, the agency also initiated legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.
FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had also acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171215288c20709.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961640/no-evidence-alleged-bondi-gunmen-received-training-in-the-philippines-security-adviser' target='_blank'><strong>No evidence alleged Bondi gunmen received training in the Philippines: security adviser</strong></a><br><p>The Philippines’ national security adviser on Wednesday said that the father and son who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach did not receive any form of military training while in the country last month.
The alleged father-and-son perpetrators opened fire on the celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism.
Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”.
In a statement, Philippine National Security Advisor Eduardo Ao said that a mere visit to the country does not substantiate allegations of terrorist training and the duration of their stay would not have permitted any meaningful or structured training.
Ao said the government was investigating the two men’s travel from November 1 to 28 and coordinating with Australian authorities to determine the purpose of the visit, dismissing media reports portraying the southern Philippines as a hotspot for violent extremism as “outdated” and “misleading”.
Immigration records show the pair landed in Manila and travelled to Davao City in Mindanao, a region long-plagued by militancy, before the attack that Australian police say appeared to have been inspired by the Islamic State.
Since the 2017 Marawi siege, a five-month battle in which the Islamic State-inspired Maute group seized the southern city and fought government forces, Philippine troops have significantly degraded ISIS-affiliated groups, Ao said.
“The remnants of these groups have been fragmented, deprived of leadership, and operationally degraded,” he added.
Earlier today, one of the alleged gunmen was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said.
New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges.
“Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.
A court filing on Wednesday named Naveed, who remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard, as the man charged.
Australian state to pass emergency gun laws
Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state where the attack took place, told a news conference on Wednesday that parliament would return on December 22 to hear “urgent” reforms, including capping the number of firearms allowed by a single person and making certain types of shotguns harder to access.
The state government will also look at reforms making it harder to hold large street protests after terror events, in order to prevent further tensions.
“We’ve got a monumental task in front of us. It’s huge,” he said.
“It’s a huge responsibility to pull the community together. I think we need a summer of calm and togetherness, not division.”
Naveed remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard. The men accused of carrying out Sunday’s attack had travelled to the southern Philippines, weeks before the shooting that Australian police said appeared to be inspired by Islamic State.
US President Donald Trump told a Hanukkah event at the White House late on Tuesday that he was thinking of the victims of the “horrific and anti-Semitic terrorist attack”.
“We join in mourning all of those who were killed, and we’re praying for the swift recovery of the wounded,” he said.
Trump called for a global fight against “radical Islamic terrorism”.
“All nations must stand together against the evil forces of radical Islamic terrorism, and we’re doing that,” he said.







Funerals begin
Funerals of the Jewish victims of Sunday’s attack began on Wednesday, amid anger over how the gunmen — one of whom was briefly investigated for links to extremists — were allowed access to powerful firearms.
A funeral for Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an assistant rabbi at Chabad Bondi Synagogue and a father of five, was held on Wednesday.
He was known for his work for Sydney’s Jewish community through Chabad, a global organisation fostering Jewish identity and connection.
Schlanger would travel to prisons and meet with Jewish people living in Sydney’s public housing communities, Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin said on Monday.
Albanese is facing criticism that his centre-left government did not do enough to prevent the spread of anti-Semitism in Australia during the two-year Israel-Gaza war.
“We will work with the Jewish community, we want to stamp out and eradicate anti-Semitism from our society,” Albanese told reporters.
The government and intelligence services are also under pressure to explain why Sajid was allowed to legally acquire the high-powered rifles and shotguns used in the attack. The government has already promised sweeping reforms to gun laws.
His son, meanwhile, was briefly investigated by Australia’s domestic intelligence agency in 2019 over alleged links to Islamic State, but there was no evidence at the time he posed a threat, Albanese said.
Man praised as hero to undergo surgery
Albanese said Ahmed al-Ahmed, 43, the man who tackled one of the shooters to disarm his rifle and suffered gunshot wounds, was due to undergo surgery on Wednesday.
Al-Ahmed’s uncle, Mohammed al-Ahmed in Syria, said his nephew left his hometown in Syria’s northwest province of Idlib nearly 20 years ago to seek work in Australia.
“We learned through social media. I called his father and he told me that it was Ahmed. Ahmed is a hero, we’re proud of him. Syria in general is proud of him,” the uncle told Reuters.
The family of 22-year-old police officer Jack Hibbert, who was shot twice on Sunday and had been on the force for just four months, said in a statement on Wednesday that he had lost vision in one eye and faced a “long and challenging recovery” ahead.
“In the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to,” the family said.
Health authorities said 22 people were still in several Sydney hospitals.
Holocaust survivor among victims
Other shooting victims included a Holocaust survivor, a husband and wife who first approached the gunmen before they started firing, and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda, according to interviews, officials and media reports.
Matilda’s father told a Bondi vigil on Tuesday night he did not want his daughter’s legacy to be forgotten.
“We came here from Ukraine and I thought that Matilda is the most Australian name that can ever exist. So just remember the name, remember her,” local media reported him as saying.
In Bondi on Wednesday, swimmers gathered on Sydney’s most popular beach and held a minute’s silence.
“This week has obviously been very profound, and this morning, I definitely feel a sense of the community getting together, and a sense of everyone sitting together,” Archie Kalaf, a 24-year-old Bondi man, told Reuters.
“Everyone’s grieving, everyone’s understanding and processing it in their own way.”</p><small>2025-12-17 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17143644f35e9f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961654/campaign-falsely-linking-bondi-shooting-suspect-to-pakistan-launched-from-hostile-countries-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Campaign falsely linking Bondi shooting suspect to Pakistan launched from ‘hostile countries’: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
The tragic attack by two men on Sunday resulted in the death of 16 people, including one of the attackers. Soon after the incident, a Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney was misidentified as one of the attackers. Later, it was confirmed that among the father-son duo of suspects, the former, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was from India, and the latter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was born in Australia.

“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.
The minister continued, “In Israel and India, this campaign was proliferated and posted on social media platforms, as well as electronic media platforms, which is very, very sad.”
He highlighted that Pakistan had been a frontline state in the war against terrorism and continued to combat terrorists. Here, he also mentioned the Army Public School massacre that took place on December 16, 2014.
A total of 147 people, including 132 students, were martyred and 180 were injured in the attack.
“So, we are a country whose children have also given sacrifices, whose children have laid down their lives in this war against terrorism,” Tarar said, adding that it was unfortunate that a “false campaign” was run against Pakistan.
He reiterated that there was not even a shred of evidence or any reliable source to back the claim that one of the Bondi Beach attackers was from Pakistan.

         View this post on Instagram            

Tarar further stated that the “misinformation campaign” against Pakistan was run deliberately, adding that it saddened him that very well-reputed media outlets fell prey to this “disinformation campaign”.
The minister said that these media houses and outlets, operating globally, had editorial boards and systems in place to verify information.
“There are structures, there is a hierarchy through which information is passed on, and editorial control is exercised. Even then, they failed to exercise the basic norms of journalism,” he said, reiterating that it was falsely claimed that one of the attackers was from Pakistan.
The claim, he said, was refuted as Indian police issued a press release on Tuesday stating that one of the suspects was from Hyderabad in India. He added that it had also been confirmed that the Indian embassy in Sydney had issued the suspect his passport.
“In fact, he travelled to the Philippines on that Indian passport as confirmed by the Philippines authorities,” Tarar said. “So, I don’t know why this campaign was run. But, it is very, very unfortunate.”
The minister then played a video that he said detailed how the campaign was run and which media outlets were involved in it.
‘Organised campaign’
After the video ended, the minister said the campaign seemed to be an organised one. “It spread like wildfire, and no editorial board, no management, no reporter questioned where the information was coming from.”
He went on to say that one of the news outlets had gone as far as claiming that the attackers were from Lahore, without showing any documentation.
“How is it possible that when you give news with regard to a terrorism incident, and you claim that the attackers are from a certain country or are of a certain origin, you have no evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim?
“It really saddens us as victims of terrorism.”
He said Pakistan had always and would always condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
Tarar pointed out that Pakistan did not instantly react to the false claim as “a responsible state acts like a responsible state by actually verifying information”.
He also questioned how it was possible that the Indian government did not know that the suspects were of “Indian origin or had Indian passports or were Indian citizens”.
“Every country has a national database through which,[using] facial recognition, it can be easily identified to which country a certain individual belongs. There are retinal scans, there are fingerprints, there is facial recognition — there is so much technology in the world now that any database would have revealed where they were from.
“But unfortunately, there was a vicious campaign to instantly say that one of the attackers, the father, was a Pakistani national,” Tarar added.
The minister linked the occurrence also to the suspects having a name that “is common in certain parts of the world”.
He said it was not sufficient evidence to pin the blame on Pakistan.
‘Who is going to cover the damage?’
Tarar also appreciated Australian authorities for “conducting themselves very professionally throughout the investigation. Despite the vicious campaign which was run all over the international media, they did not cast any aspersions in this regard, and they actually waited for this information to be verified”.
Saying that now that it was clear that the suspect was from India, Tarar added, “My question is, and I have the right to question, that who is going to cover the damage that was caused to Pakistan through these fake posts and false information.
“How do we go back to the position before the Bondi Beach attack? Should we initiate legal proceedings? Should we request an apology? Or will it just become a part of history as a campaign based on absolutely fake and false information to malign Pakistan?”
‘’India-backed terrorism in Pakistan’
He said acts of terrorism had been taking place elsewhere in the world as well, recalling the murder and assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.

 

Nijjar was shot dead by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over in 2023 after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. India was accused of being involved in his assassination, but New Delhi termed the allegation “absurd”.
“We have seen transnational assassinations taking place. We have seen this incident,” Tarar said during his briefing, adding, “We know that India supports terrorism in Pakistan.”
The minister said the Inter-Service Public Relations director general and he, too, had shared evidence of terrorism in Balochistan and Kyber Pakhtunkhwa being backed and funded by India.
“There is irrefutable evidence to prove that.”
In addition, he said, “Whenever Afghan soil is used for an attack in Pakistan, somewhere there is an indian link.”
Saying that the Afghanistan government had been cosying up to India these days, Tarar questioned: “What is the main reason behind it? Do they have any bilateral trade? Do they have other areas of mutual cooperation the great potential of which they want to realise?”
Reiterating that there was “irrefutable evidence of Indian terrorism in Pakistan”, he alleged that the country was not just involved in funding terrorism but also planning the attacks in Balochistan and KP.
Again highlighting that Pakistan had been fighting terrorism for long and rendered sacrifices in doing so, Tarar repeated that the campaign against Pakistan following the Bondi Beach shooting was unfortunate.
“And a country from where this campaign originated, and most of the Indian outlets that aired the [false] news without verification, they had no right to do this.
“Because their country is supporting terrorism, and we are fighting terrorism. That is the difference between India and Pakistan,” he continued.
Tarar further stated that now that there was credible information and irrefutable evidence of one of the suspects hailing from Indian, “how do you vindicate Pakistan in this? How do you say that ‘we are sorry and this should not have happened’”.
He asserted that while Pakistan had stood for peace, would always promote peace and condemn incidents of terrorism, the media was required to act responsibly and “pin the blame where it lies”. The media, he stressed, needed to verify the information and then disseminate it.
Again mentioning Nijjar’s assassination, Tarar said it “shows you the true face of the Indian state”.
He also mentioned the recent incident of the chief minister of Indian state of Bihar pulling off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony.
“This just shows the mindset that is prevalent in that country with regard to extremism of any kind. Their society is absolutely disoriented. They don’t have any narrative to sell to the world, any story to tell to the world.
“All you can find within India is extremism of every kind being promoted. Because you have a government [there] which believes in extremism, suppressing the minorities and their rights and promoting terrorism and extremism,” Tarar commented.
‘Highly condemnable’
Earlier in the media briefing, the minister termed the Bondi Beach shooting “highly condemnable”, adding that “since Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and has remained a victim for so many years, we actually know what it feels like”.
“We can feel the pain of Australia, the citizens of Australia. We can relate to them because we see this happening in Pakistan,” he said, expressing solidarity with the government and people of Australia.
He also lauded the Australian citizen who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers and “saved several lives”.
During the Bondi Beach incident, 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed had hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. He was hospitalised after getting injured in his bid to stop the attackers and has been hailed as a hero around the world.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1716443881b7e3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961657/sincaraz-rivalry-lights-up-2025-season-women-share-the-spotlight' target='_blank'><strong>‘Sincaraz’ rivalry lights up 2025 season, women share the spotlight</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner turned 2025 into a gripping tug-of-war for tennis supremacy by carving up the Grand Slams for a second straight year, while the women’s game showcased depth and drama with four different major champions.
Sinner’s dominant victory over Alexander Zverev at the start of the season helped him retain his Australian Open title and become the first Italian to capture three majors, moving past Nicola Pietrangeli who won back-to-back French Opens in 1959-60.
What followed after Sinner’s three-month ban in February for anti-doping violations in 2024 was nothing short of spectacular, as he took his era-defining rivalry with Alcaraz to the biggest stage in an epic five-set Roland Garros final.

 

Alcaraz ultimately prevailed after saving three match points — one of the sport’s great comebacks in the longest Paris final at five hours and 29 minutes — with the Spaniard establishing himself as the “Prince of Clay” in the post-Rafa Nadal era.
The “Sincaraz” slugfest continued in the Wimbledon final, where Sinner avenged his painful defeat by beating Alcaraz to raise his first trophy on the famous All England Club lawns, perfectly setting up their inevitable US Open showdown.
After thumping Novak Djokovic in the semi-final to prolong the Serb’s wait for a record 25th major title, Alcaraz dazzled under New York’s lights to dismantle Sinner in the final and tighten his grip on their rivalry.
“I give 100 per cent every day to improve … to see what I can do better to beat Jannik and win these kinds of trophies,” Alcaraz said after his second US Open triumph.
“Having this rivalry means a lot. It’s super special for me, for him and for people who enjoy it every single time we play.”
Career grand slam
With six Grand Slam titles under his belt to Sinner’s four, Alcaraz will look to eclipse Nadal and become the youngest man to complete the set of all majors when he heads Down Under in the New Year.
Melbourne provided the biggest surprise in the women’s game as Madison Keys dethroned Aryna Sabalenka to win her first Grand Slam title at 29, the American becoming the fourth-oldest first-time major champion in the professional era that began in 1968.
Coco Gauff hoisted the French Open title, beating Sabalenka in the final to give American fans another high point but Amanda Anisimova endured a brutal reality check in the Wimbledon final, where Iga Swiatek triumphed without dropping a game.
Anisimova shrugged off the double bagel and reached the US Open final but more heartbreak was in store as Sabalenka proved too strong in the battle of big-hitters and retained her title, taking her Grand Slam tally to four.
Sabalenka’s hopes of finishing the season with another title were dashed when the world number one was comprehensively beaten in the WTA Finals decider, where Elena Rybakina pocketed $5.235 million after a flawless Riyadh campaign.
Larger prize pots were a major talking point through the season as the Professional Tennis Players’ Association filed a lawsuit against the sport’s stakeholders while leading players wrote to the Grand Slams seeking a bigger slice of the pie.
While off-court battles over pay and governance rumbled on, opportunities were scarce beyond the duopoly at the top of the men’s game, leaving Djokovic to provide the year’s standout moments for the chasing pack.
The 38-year-old Serb limited his appearances but sparkled with his 100th career title in Geneva and his 101st in Athens, where he paid an emotional tribute to his former coach Nikola Pilic, who died in September aged 86.
The tennis world was in mourning again following the death of Pietrangeli aged 92, shortly after Italy retained the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup trophies and Sinner beat new world number one Alcaraz to retain the ATP Finals title.</p><small>2025-12-17 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171200169f3cb7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961644/25m-undocumented-migrants-left-us-in-2025-amid-travel-bans-security-fears' target='_blank'><strong>2.5m undocumented migrants left US in 2025 amid travel bans, security fears</strong></a><br><p>The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Wednesday reported that more than 2.5 million undocumented migrants have left the US since the Trump administration took office on January 20, 2025, amid a sharp expansion of immigration enforcement.
According to DHS, the total includes over 605,000 formal deportations and approximately 1.9m “self-departures”, referring to migrants who left voluntarily amid intensified enforcement pressure.
The department said removals have focused on individuals it describes as criminal offenders, while also encouraging undocumented migrants to leave on their own through a government-run mobile application offering free flights and a $1,000 incentive.
The announcement — the administration’s most significant immigration update this year — comes as Washington tightens entry rules, expands travel bans, and increasingly links immigration control to national security and counter-terrorism concerns.
While DHS presented the figures as evidence of restored “law and order”, immigration experts caution that the numbers combine distinct categories that were historically reported separately. Formal deportations — court-ordered or administrative removals — are being counted alongside voluntary exits, many of which occur under the implicit threat of detention or arrest.
At the same time, the scale of interior enforcement has expanded sharply. Detention facilities operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are holding record numbers of migrants, straining capacity and raising due process concerns as immigration courts continue to face massive case backlogs.
Travel bans expanded
The DHS announcement coincides with a major expansion of US travel restrictions. On Dec 16, the White House added seven countries — including Syria and Palestinian Authority travel document holders, along with Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Laos, and Sierra Leone — to the list of nations whose citizens face full or near-total entry bans.
With these additions, 20 countries now face broad US travel restrictions, many of them Muslim-majority or conflict-affected states. The administration argues that weak identity verification systems and limited information-sharing cooperation make proper vetting impossible.
Human rights groups counter that nationality-based bans punish entire populations and undermine international norms of individual assessment, while also complicating diplomatic relations and counter-terrorism cooperation.
Security and terrorism as policy drivers
US officials have increasingly framed immigration enforcement as a national security imperative, particularly following violent incidents involving foreign nationals. The White House cited the arrest of an Afghan suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend as justification for accelerating travel restrictions.

 

But Senator Bernie Sanders,  a prominent progressive voice in US politics, cited last week’s terrorist attack in Sydney to argue against religious hatred, noting that a Muslim father risked his life to stop an attack on Jewish worshippers. In a social media statement, Sanders, who is also Jewish, said religion must not divide humanity and called for an end to antisemitism, Islamophobia and all forms of hate, describing the act as a reminder of shared human values that transcend faith and identity.
Recent terrorist attacks have stirred a global debate on immigration — as some underscored the disconnect between individual acts of solidarity and broad-brush security policies.
Implications for Pakistanis
Pakistan is not included in the current travel ban, but the broader enforcement climate has implications for Pakistani nationals in the United States.
Pakistani citizens largely reside in the US on student, work, family-based, or visitor visas, but immigration lawyers report increased scrutiny of visa renewals, status changes, and airport inspections. Visa overstays — including those who entered legally — now face a higher enforcement risk than in previous years.
Community organisations say fear of detention has reduced engagement with public institutions, particularly among mixed-status families. While no targeted measures have been announced against Pakistanis, the environment has become less predictable.
Economists warn that sudden return migration often leads to underemployment, especially for workers whose experience is tied to US labour markets. Within the US, reduced migrant labour is already being felt in agriculture, construction, and services, with employers reporting shortages and rising costs.
Internationally, the US approach has drawn mixed reactions. Some governments acknowledge Washington’s security concerns, while others warn that sweeping bans and mass deportations risk eroding humanitarian commitments and straining bilateral ties.
The DHS announcement marks a defining moment in US immigration policy — one that reflects a decisive shift toward enforcement-driven governance anchored in security concerns.</p><small>2025-12-17 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/171239485b7acf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961647/justice-jahangiri-moves-fcc-against-ihc-order-declaring-plea-challenging-his-law-degree-maintainable' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Jahangiri moves FCC against IHC order declaring plea challenging his law degree maintainable</strong></a><br><p>Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri moved the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Wednesday, seeking the setting aside of an Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that declared a plea challenging the legitimacy of his law degree maintainable.
He also sought the dismissal of the plea, which also calls into question the appointment of the IHC judge, “for being non-maintainable”.
The plea, filed by lawyer Mian Dawood, was declared maintainable by a division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, on December 9.
Justice Jahangiri filed a petition against the order in the FCC on Wednesday, in which he has nominated Dawood, the Federation of Pakistan, president of Pakistan, Judicial Commission of Pakistan, parliamentary committee on judges’ appointment to superior courts, Higher Education Commission, University of Karachi (KU) and a lawyer named Siraj Ahmad as respondents.
He contended that the IHC order on maintaibility of the case, a September 16 order that barred him from judicial work and the “unnecessary haste with which the division bench is proceeding” against him, “make it clear that the bench, in particular the honourable chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, is biased against” him.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, recalled that on the conclusion of the case’s hearing on December 2, the proceedings were adjourned until December 9.
It said until then, no notice had been issued to Justice Jahangiri by the IHC, and as such, neither did he appear before the court on December 2 nor was he represented.
“Nevertheless, the order dated December 2 erroneously records the attendance of ‘Mr Aleem Khan Abbasi and Mr Riasat Ali Azad, advocates for respondent no.1’(the petitioner),” it added.
Justice Jahangiri’s petition highlighted that the plea challenging his degree was declared maintainable, among other grounds, on the basis that his “eligibility” and not his “conduct” as the high court judge had been challenged.
Referring to a KU report submitted to the IHC, the petition contended that it failed to disclose a declaration by the university of the withdrawal and cancellation of the judge’s degree on September 25 stood suspended following an October 3 Sindh High Court order.
It termed the IHC order declaring the plea challenging Justice Jahangiri’s law degree “unconstitutional, unlawful and liable to be set aside”.
It was pointed out in Justice Jahangiri’s petition that the IHC division issued its order on the maintainability of the plea before issuing a notice to him. Moreover, while several parties, including those “who have not been impleaded as parties” in the plea were heard on the issue of maintainability, but Justice Jahangiri was not.
“This amounts to a violation of the petitioner’s (Justice Jahangiri) fundamental right to due process and fair trial as enshrined under Article 10-A of the Constitution.”
It was also highlighted in Justice Jahangiri’s petition that the IHC order had not been made subject to his right to question the maintainability of the plea challenging his qualification.
“This issue has been decided once and for all, behind the petitioner’s back and without hearing him.
“The impugned order is liable to be set aside on this count alone,” the petition stated.
It added that the plea challenging the judge’s qualification raised factual questions about his degree’s validity. The petition contended that a high court could not decide such “factual disputes” in exercise of its constitutional jurisdictions and that they were to be decided by “a court of competent jurisdiction after a full trial involving the recording of evidence”.
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.</p><small>2025-12-17 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17133935ccd06e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961652/emotional-carey-slams-ton-to-give-australia-upper-hand-in-3rd-ashes-test' target='_blank'><strong>Emotional Carey slams ton to give Australia upper hand in 3rd Ashes Test</strong></a><br><p>An emotional Alex Carey slammed a majestic 106 on his home ground and Usman Khawaja hit a defiant 82 Wednesday to put Australia in the driving seat of the third Ashes Test against England.
Batting after captain Pat Cummins won the toss as temperatures topped 36 Celsius at Adelaide Oval, the hosts were 326-8 at stumps on day one after the shock of Steve Smith being ruled out with illness.
Mitchell Starc was not out 33 and Nathan Lyon yet to score.

“To make a hundred here in front of home fans and family was special,” an emotional Carey told Australian TV.
As he celebrated his maiden Ashes ton, Carey gestured towards the sky in a nod to his father Gordon, who died from cancer in September.
“I guess you know as well why I was looking to the heavens. I’m trying not to tear up. But, no, it was great.”
The wicketkeeper’s wife Eloise was spotted in tears by TV cameras as he celebrated.
“To have, mum, brother, sister, Eloise, the kids (here), it was a special moment,” Carey added.
A tireless Jofra Archer ended with 3-29 on a tough day for England’s bowlers in the field.
“I thought it was a good performance from our bowlers, the heat took us a bit by surprise,” said England bowling coach David Saker.
“The boys toiled away.
“(Archer) had a point to prove, he sustained his pace and bowled at the stumps, and he was well supported.”
Khawaja reprieve
Australia lead the five-Test series 2-0 and will retain the Ashes if they win or draw, after back-to-back eight-wicket thumpings in Perth and Brisbane.
Smith, who has more than 10,000 runs, had been feeling unwell in the lead-up but was on Tuesday named in the side.
He was on the field during the morning warm-up but left 20 minutes before the toss shaking his head.
His absence gave an unexpected reprieve to Khawaja, who turns 39 on Thursday and had been overlooked as opener in favour of Travis Head and Jake Weatherald.
Khawaja, who missed Brisbane after suffering back spasms in Perth, grabbed his chance in a stoic knock.
He was eventually out just before tea, slog-sweeping to Josh Tongue in the deep off the spin of Will Jacks.
Carey picked up the mantle, first alongside Josh Inglis (32), then Pat Cummins (13), and latterly Starc, who once more showed his prowess with the bat.
Carey hit eight fours and a six in his third Test century, bringing up the milestone in front of family, friends and 56,298 fans — the biggest cricket crowd ever at the venue.
Archer burst
A blistering first over after lunch from Archer had left Australia reeling at 94-4.
He removed Marnus Labuschagne for 19 with his first ball after the interval.
Two deliveries later Cameron Green was gone, with Brydon Carse collecting catches at midwicket to dismiss both.
Inglis and Cummins fell in the final session to Tongue and Carse respectively.
Players from both teams wore black armbands as a mark of respect to the victims of the Bondi Beach mass shooting.
A moment of silence was held before the game with security tightened and flags flying at half-mast.

At the start, Weatherald raced to 18 off 27 balls but his gung-ho approach cost him against the pace of Archer, who fired down a bouncer and induced a top edge to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.
Head followed next over for 10, with Zak Crawley taking a sensational instinctive catch low to his left off Carse.
Khawaja, on five, was fortunate to survive when Harry Brook dropped a sitter at second slip and went on to bring up his 28th Test 50 to big cheers.
Carey had a life on 52 when Carse put down a difficult chance in the covers and the 34-year-old made the most of it before falling when he top-edged Jacks to Smith just before the close.</p><small>2025-12-17 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1712181011aff3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961645/trial-court-begins-recording-prosecution-witnesses-statements-afresh-in-social-media-post-case-against-imaan-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Trial court begins recording prosecution witnesses’ statements afresh in social media post case against Imaan, Hadi</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court began recording the statements of prosecution witnesses afresh in the controversial social media posts case against human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, on Wednesday.
The statements are being recorded again in compliance with directives issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) the previous day while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order.
During the hearing on November 19, Mazari’s lawyer marked her presence while Chattha, too, was not present throughout the entirety of the proceedings. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies, to which Chatha had objected and questioned how the statements could be recorded in the absence of the accused.
Both Mazari and Chattha were present on Wednesday in the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka as the process to record the statements of prosecution witnesses was reinitiated.
The statements of two prosecution witnesses, Afzal and Shahroz Riaz, were recorded. Meanwhile, the court was informed that the statements of two more prosecution witnesses were yet to be recorded.
Following the recording of the statements, Mazari informed the court that she had to travel to Rawalpindi.
At that, the court adjourned the hearing till Thursday (tomorrow).
The controversy at the centre of the case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
Consequently, an inquiry was initiated, and following its conclusion on Aug 22, 2025, a first information report was registered against the two, alleging commission of offences under sections 9, 10, 11 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA).
They were indicted in the case on October 30.
Mazari questions pace of trial
A video posted on the social media platform X showed Mazari speaking to the media outside the court. In her remarks, she commented on the difference in the way the case was handled, saying that their presence had proven to be necessary.
“You will see a marked difference in the way the prosecution’s evidence was recorded before and how it was recorded today,” she said.
“This is why the presence of the accused in the court is really necessary …At this time we raise our objections; we ensure that the witness statement being recorded is indeed the witness’s own statement, that they are the authors of the documents they are having exhibited,” she explained.







At the same time, she also requested to review the rapid pace at which the case was being handled.
“We are satisfied with today’s hearing, but we obviously still have this request to allow a fair trial — a fair trial cannot be this speedy,” Mazari added.
“We are lawyers, we too have cases, and our lawyers also have cases. We are fully cooperating in this trial and will face it — just slow down a little,” she said.
She said that in today’s proceedings, they had asked that one of the witnesses show identification to prove to the court who he was, as he was not in uniform and didn’t have a service card.
“When he brought out his card, he brought out a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) card. He doesn’t even have a NCCIA card,” she said. “So how was he presented as a NCCIA witness to provide evidence?”
“This is the second time the prosecution is recording its witness statements, but even so, neither have they come prepared nor do they know what their witness is saying — they are standing there tutoring the witness, and even then the witness cannot give a proper testimony,” she added.
“So this shows you that this is a completely false, baseless, frivolous case,” she asserted.</p><small>2025-12-17 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17131857f315d74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961650/pakistan-extends-airspace-ban-for-indian-aircraft-till-jan-23' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace ban for Indian aircraft till Jan 23</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday extended the airspace restrictions on Indian aircraft till January 23.
The extension was notified a week before the previous one was set to expire on December 24.
“Pakistan airspace will remain closed to Indian-registered aircraft, including all aircraft owned, operated, or leased by Indian airlines, as well as Indian military flights,” the authority said,
“According to the NOTAM, the restriction, which has already been in force, will continue until January 23, 2026, as per the specified timings,” it said.


Notam issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority.

Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.
New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe. Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict.
Amid a financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan, it was reported in November that Air India was lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes.</p><small>2025-12-17 08:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17105911d672d9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961642/president-assents-to-bill-for-setting-up-minorities-commission' target='_blank'><strong>President assents to bill for setting up minorities’ commission</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday assented to three bills on the advice of the prime minister, including one for establishing a statutory body to protect and promote the rights of minority communities in the country.
According to a statement released by the Presidency, Zardari approved three pieces of legislation on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
These include the Qanun-e-Shahadat (Amendment) Bill 2025, the King Hamad University of Nursing and Associated Medical Sciences Bill 2025 and the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill 2025.
The statement added that the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025 was sent back to the premier “in view of the need for provincial consultation”.
“In the case of establishment of Daanish schools in the provinces, prior consultation with the respective provincial governments is essential,” the statement quoted the president as saying.
The National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill 2025 was passed with a majority vote during a joint session of Parliament earlier this month amid stiff opposition from both sides of the aisle.
The opposition was based on fears that a provision giving the law an overriding effect would affect the anti-Ahmadiyya ordinance promulgated in 1984.
A motion seeking leave of the House to take up the bill for immediate consideration was opposed by around one-third of the members present in the joint sitting. A total of 160 members voted in favour of the bill while 79 opposed it.
The bill was, however, passed with certain amendments, including the omission of the clause giving it overriding effect and a change to withdraw the suo motu powers earlier proposed for the National Commission for Minorities’ Rights.
During the session, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar made it clear that the bill would neither dilute the anti-Ahmadiyya provisions nor affect any court judgement. “Neither the law nor the Constitution, nor our conscience, allows us to make a proposal that contradicts the Holy Quran and Sunnah,” he remarked.
He said the Constitution and the state had declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, but they did not accept this and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the bill. He said that when the decision declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims was challenged, the Supreme Court had held that the protection under Article 20 of the Constit­ution was not available to those who did not recognise their non-Muslim status.
The minister said four amendments had been suggested to the original draft and these had been incorporated into the proposed legislation. Saying that minorities were defined as “non-Muslims” in the Constitution, he added: “This is a commission for non-Muslims. Our Hindu, Christian and Parsi brothers are as good Pakistanis as we are.”
Tarar recalled that a 2014 Supreme Court judgement had called for the constitution of a commission for minorities. The matter had landed in the joint sitting after around 10 years, he added, before the debate on the bill began. He underlined that the proposed commission would not have punitive powers and would instead send its recommendations to the government.
“Our Christian, Hindu, Parsi, Sikh and other non-Muslim brothers and sisters deserve a forum to address issues — whether forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights or other matters of dignity,” he told the joint sitting.</p><small>2025-12-17 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1709342257d1587.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961637/imrans-sons-planning-to-visit-pakistan-in-january-say-ex-premier-being-held-in-death-cell' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sons planning to visit Pakistan in January, say ex-premier being held in ‘death cell’</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has said he and his brother Suleiman have applied for their visas and are planning a trip to Pakistan in January, while also commenting on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”.
The remarks were made during an interview to Yalda Hakim for Sky News, which came as another sit-in held outside Adiala jail by Imran’s sisters over being denied a meeting with him was dispersed using water cannons; the party alleged that authorities used “chemical-laced” water.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
During their interview with Hakim, released early on Wednesday, Kasim and Suleiman, who live in London, were asked whether they had tried to engage with the Pakistani government to get permission to visit Imran.
Hakim also noted that they had previously talked about “being warned not to come” even though Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said they “were welcome to come and can visit him [Imran]”.
At that, Kasim replied: “We are now planning to because they said it openly. So — unless they go against their word — we should be hopefully going in January. We have applied for our visas. […] It hasn’t come through yet. We are expecting it to come through, so we are planning a trip in January.”



Hakim then asked them what they would say to Imran upon seeing him, and whether they would ask him to consider “cutting a deal”.
But Kasim explained that “what you have to understand is it’s his life. It’s literally his passion and his goal. He calls it his life’s purpose to help rid Pakistan of corruption”.
“And so if he just took a deal and came over to us and lived in England, I know there would be this burning desire and this aching that he has left his country for dead. And he would be depressed, to be honest. I know he would.
“This is his goal, and as much as we’d love to have our father watching all of our cricket matches or football matches over here, he has a purpose which is far greater. So, you can only respect it,” he said.
Asked what else they would want to say to Imran or what message they would like to send to him, Kasim said, “I want to know how we can get him out, how we can help because the main point is we feel so helpless at this point. I mean, there’s so much to catch up on.”
He also shared that during their interactions, Imran would always refuse to talk about his jail conditions.
“He’s like, ‘Oh, you know, don’t worry about me. How’s everything?’” Kasim said, adding that he would also enquire about their grandmother Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who died in October.
“We haven’t spoken to him since she died only a couple of months ago, and I would love to speak to him about that. He called her his mother after his own mother had passed, and their relationship was so close. So, I’d love to speak to him about that,” he added.
When Hakim asked them whether they think Imran “will ever get out”, their reply was not too optimistic.
“The conditions are getting worse. The people in power are becoming more entrenched. So, it’s very hard to see a way out and a lot of the people we speak to […] are seeming less and less confident every time we speak to them.
“So, we’re now worried we might never see him again,” Kasim said.
He added that while the defence minister had said that they were welcome to visit Imran, he had his doubts.
Suleiman also pointed out that Imran was “not the sort of person who’s going to make any compromises or cut a deal. So yeah, at the moment, that looks like the only easy route out, but I think international pressure is always an effective way of forcing change in these situations”.
‘Awful conditions’
Hakim also asked the two about the condition of Imran’s jail cell, to which Kasim said, “The conditions are awful. Like, they are not bad, they are awful.”
Suleiman said the cell in which Imran was kept had been described as a “death cell”.
“There are barely any lights, sometimes the electricity is cut off, there’s dirty water […] completely substandard conditions that don’t meet international laws for any sort of prisoner,” he claimed.
They were also asked about “what went through their minds” when they came across rumours about Imran’s possible death on social media.

 

Suleiman described that experience as “incredibly stressful”.
“I went straight to my family group chat because that’s the only reliable source that we have on the ground in Pakistan,” he added.
For his part, Kasim said coming across the rumours on social media was “jarring”.
It “obviously pulls you out of whatever you are trying to do in your normal life. Especially, [given] how helpless we are over here, not able to do much at all,” he said.
Hakim also brought up the subject of one of Imran’s sisters, Uzma, being allowed to meet him in jail in early December after weeks of restricted access. Following the meeting, a post on Imran’s X account against the military leadership, dubbed his message from jail, had led to a hard-hitting press briefing by Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry.
Asked what Uzma shared with Kasim and Suleiman after the meeting, the latter replied that she had assured them that Imran was well but furious about the conditions he had been kept in.
“And he put out — he dictated a tweet (post on social media platform X) I think through her, or maybe potentially through her. And I think that tweet has partly led to this reaction from the establishment to completely try and isolate him,” Suleiman said.
When Hakim asked them what would be their message to the international community, Suleiman said, “At minimum, just to make sure that the standards of international human rights are being upheld, and right now they’re clearly being violated.
“We just want to ensure that basic human rights for our father are being respected,” he said.
He also highlighted the need for “independent monitoring” of Imran’s conditions “because we have no idea what it’s like until someone goes to see him and speaks to him”.
For his part, Kasim stressed the need for implementing court orders for Imran’s visitation rights, respecting the rule of law and allowing the PTI founder to see his personal physician.
Hakim also asked the brothers about what Imran’s opinion would be on recent constitutional amendments in Pakistan, especially the immunity given to the army chief under the tweaks.
To that, Kasim said he believed Imran would not be surprised.
“Because I think it’s quite clear that it was heading towards basically what it is now, which is a military dictatorship in everything but name. I think he probably knows about this already. And part of the reason he’s being silenced, isolated is because they know that he’s inevitably not going to stand for this,” he added.
‘Afraid of his popularity’
The duo also shared that they were looking to do more advocacy and visit Brussels or Geneva in January to speak to politicians and officials about Imran’s situation.
Hakim then asked them whether they ever thought that one day they would be lobbying for their father’s release.
“Yes, probably, realistically, because we spent, he especially, my brother spent a lot of time asking him not to go into politics when there were kind of these dangerous characters killing people consistently,” Kasim replied.
Adding that several other Pakistani politicians had also been imprisoned, Kasim said: “This is just completely different. They’re not all tortured in solitary confinement cells and staying there for upwards of two years.”
Without naming anyone, Hakim then asked them, “What do you think they’re afraid of?”
“Popularity,” the two replied in unison.
“He’s the most popular person in the country by a landslide. So the moment he’s out, there’s no chance they’ll hold on to power. So they’re desperately clinging on to it however they can,” Kasim said.
‘Doesn’t sound like solitary confinement’
Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, also appeared on Hakim’s show and said that Imran had been incarcerated for around 860 days.
“How many unique visits — interviews is what we call them in our system — do you think he’s had in those 860 days? … He’s supposed to get, as you said, one every week, and it’s been about 112 weeks. He’s had 870,” he said.
He further said that Imran had held 137 meetings with his sisters, 45 with Aleema, 45 with Uzma and 43 with Noreen, noting that Aleema had held two more meetings since the numbers were tabulated.
“This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers. He insisted that Imran’s personal physician was allowed to see him.
“There was a gap of about three and a half weeks in which the meetings were suspended. Now, those meetings were suspended because in every instance, there was a huge security issue that was being created. Every interaction that the former prime minister has had with his lawyers, with his family, becomes a political meeting,” Zaidi said.
When Hakim pointed out that his sons had not spoken to him for five months, Zaidi said, “His last phone call was in September. I’m not sure whether one of the boys was on it or not.”
He further said that neither he nor anyone in the government wanted to “get into an argument with two young men who have not seen their father in a long time but against whom there is no sanction to not see or not speak to their father”.
At this point, Hakim pointed out that Zaidi had not answered any of her questions, to which he said he could not respond if she did not let him.
“Your questions are coming from a place of genuinely seeking the truth and seeking justice … I think that these are honest people who are dealing with bad information. And so what I’m trying to do is provide you information but you don’t let me get all of it out,” he said.
He also read out rule 265 of the Prison Rules, which states, “The discussion of political matters shall not be allowed at these interviews.”
He said that since Imran had been jailed, there had been 575 posts from his X account.
At this point, Hakim pulled up an old X post by Zaidi from 2023 when Imran had been arrested, in which he had called the move “disgraceful”. She also read out a similar post from 2024. She then asked whether he stood by his posts.
“At the time, I [posted] them, absolutely,” he said, adding that more developments had taken place since then.







He pointed to the May conflict with India, the 2024 attacks by Iran and constant attacks emanating from Afghanistan, saying that the way Pakistan had to respond to security and governance challenges had changed.
“Are you saying Imran Khan is a threat?” Hakim asked, to which Zaidi replied, “Absolutely.”
At one point, Hakim pointed to the report by the UN special rapporteur, asking Zaidi whether he thought she was lying.
“I don’t think anybody is lying. I think people are consuming bad information,” he said, then pointing out that Hakim had not visited Pakistan in a decade.
“If you give me a visa, I would happily [visit]. Would you give me an interview with Imran Khan?” she asked. Zaidi responded by saying she could interview Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“I’m not sure that, given the prison rules that I just cited, we’ll be allowed to afford Sky News the chance to break Pakistan’s laws,” he said.
“I think people want rule of law, but they want it very specifically in circumstances that allow Imran Khan to enjoy total freedom at a time of incarceration. The whole purpose of being a convicted criminal is that you’re in jail and you lose your freedom,” he said. He further said that concerns raised by the UN had come from those who “had not visited Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-12-17 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17091058939a8b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961633/trump-adds-7-countries-including-syria-to-full-travel-ban-list' target='_blank'><strong>Trump adds 7 countries, including Syria, to full travel ban list</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday expanded a list of countries subject to a full travel ban, prohibiting citizens from an additional seven countries, including Syria, from entering the country.
The White House said in a statement that Trump signed a proclamation “expanding and strengthening entry restrictions on nationals from countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats”.







Tuesday’s move banned citizens from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Syria and those holding Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents.
The action also imposes a full ban on Laos and Sierra Leone, which had previously only been subject to partial restrictions.
The White House said the expanded ban goes into effect on January 1.
The action comes despite Trump’s vow to do everything he could to make Syria successful after landmark talks in November with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who until recently was sanctioned by Washington as a foreign terrorist.
Trump has backed Sharaa, whose visit capped a stunning year for the rebel-turned-ruler who toppled longtime autocratic leader Bashar al-Assad and has since traveled the world trying to depict himself as a moderate leader who wants to unify his war-ravaged nation and end its decades of international isolation.
But in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump vowed “very serious retaliation” after the US military said two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria by a suspected Islamic State attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead.
He described the incident in remarks to reporters as a “terrible” attack.
The White House cited visa overstay rates for Syria in its justification for the ban.
“Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and internal strife. While the country is working to address its security challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures,” the White House said.
US adds more nations to partial restrictions list
Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.
The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers.
The travel ban remains on those twelve countries, the White House said.
Trump also added partial restrictions and entry limitations on an additional 15 countries, including Nigeria, which is under scrutiny from Trump, who in early November threatened military action over the treatment of Christians in the country.
Nigeria says claims that Christians face persecution misrepresent a complex security situation and do not take into account efforts to safeguard religious freedom.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.
The expansion of the countries subject to entry restrictions marks a further escalation of immigration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last month.
Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.
Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define the term.</p><small>2025-12-17 04:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17080934acd5c44.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961604/pakistani-canadian-sanctioned-by-eu-for-trading-russian-oil' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani-Canadian sanctioned by EU for trading Russian oil</strong></a><br><p>BRUSSELS: An obscure Pakistani-Canadian businessman is named among those sanctioned by Western authorities for dealing in sanctioned Russian oil and enriching Vladimir Putin’s war economy.
The European Union on Monday adopted fresh sanctions against Russian oil interests, targeting a handful of traders for helping Moscow to circumvent Western sanctions on crude exports.
The latest EU sanctions prohibit the bloc’s citizens from doing business with the listed companies and individuals, reducing their access to shipping and insurance providers. The EU has listed more than 2,600 individuals and companies in total.
The EU has targeted nine individuals and entities supporting Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers, the Council of the European Union and the EU’s Official Journal said, referring to businessmen linked to oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil as well as shipping companies that own and manage tankers.

Murtaza Lakhani is also said to have sold Iraqi oil under Saddam regime; holds stake in Arctic Vostok Oil project

Among those targeted by the EU is Canadian-Pakistani oil trader Murtaza Lakhani, CEO of trading company Mercantile & Maritime. “Through his companies, he enables shipments and export of Russian oil, notably from the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft,” said the listing in the EU’s Official Journal.
“In particular, Murtaza Lakhani controls vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products originating in Russia or being exported from Russia.”
He started his career at global trader Glencore, where he worked on Iraqi oil exports during the Saddam Hussein era and later moved to Iraq’s Kurdistan region, where he acted as an intermediary between the oil ministry and international companies to sell oil independently of Baghdad.
During this period, he helped Russian state-controlled energy giant Rosneft to sign oil and gas deals in Kurdistan, working closely with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, including during signing ceremonies at Russia’s main economic forum in St Petersburg.
Building on this relationship, Lakhani partnered with top oil trader Vitol to invest in a 5pc stake in Rosneft’s largest oil project in decades, Vostok Oil in the Arctic.
“This country (Russia) is the largest resource country in the world. Hampering it is a very short-term effect, not a long-term goal for anybody. They will always need Russia,” he told Russia’s SolovievLive at the St Petersburg Forum in June.
Lakhani, Mercantile & Maritime, Litasco Middle East DMCC and 2Rivers Group did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions so far, but Moscow has managed to adapt to most measures and is still selling millions of barrels of oil to India and China, albeit at discounts to global prices. Much of this is transported using a so-called shadow fleet of vessels operating outside of the Western maritime industry.
The bloc is expected to list more than 40 ships in Russia’s shadow fleet this week, bringing the total to about 600 vessels.

A SCREEN grab from a viral video shows Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down the veil of a doctor, who came to receive a certificate.

NEW DELHI: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar invited criticism from the opposition on Tuesday after he pulled off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony.
Opening himself up to more questions about his mental health a month after taking oath as the Bihar chief minister for the 10th time, Kumar was seen in a widely shared video clip as pulling a hijab down from the woman’s face during a government event in Patna.
The video clip shows the 74-year-old politician handing a certificate to an AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) doctor during the event on Monday and motioning to her to remove her hijab.
Before the woman could react, Kumar is seen reaching out and pulling down the hijab, exposing her mouth and chin.

Nitish Kumar’s act of pulling down woman’s face covering draws condemnation, raises questions about his mental health

The moment appeared to catch the woman off guard. Two men, including Bihar’s Home Minister Samrat Choudhary, half-heartedly attempted to stop Kumar, while others on stage laughed, treating the moment as an awkward joke rather than a violation.
The clip has sparked widespread outrage across India and Pakistan, with social media users, activists and commentators demanding an apology, as well as the resignation of the 74-year-old chief minister.

For many, the incident has become less about one man’s lapse in judgment and more about the normalisation of disrespect toward Muslims in India.
Terming Kumar’s act “vile”, the Congress party said he should resign from the chief minister’s post, while the former chief minister Lalu Yadav’s party said it was wondering whether this was proof of his mental health deteriorating.
Weeks before the Bihar elections in November, which Mr. Kumar’s JDU party and the BJP swept, he had come under fire after a video of him garlanding a woman at a public meeting had gone viral. A JDU MP, who tried to stop him from doing so, was rebuked by the chief minister.
Infuriated, Zaira Wasim, a former Indian actor, demanded an “unconditional apology” from Kumar. “A woman’s dignity and modesty are not props to toy with”, she wrote.
Politician Priyanka Chaturvedi said that she wouldn’t be surprised if the woman were to say that “she is okay about it”, as she will be one facing consequences regardless.
Member of the Lok Sabha, Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi, called for an apology, labelling it an “indefensible” and “deeply disturbing” act.
He also highlighted that the CM should be stepping down from his role after this “erratic” behaviour, questioning his mental ability.
Fact-checker Mohammed Zubair wrote on X: “Even Deputy CM tried to stop him. He wouldn’t have done this if he was in his sense[s]. There are several such videos of him behaving awkwardly.”







Iltija Mehbooba Mufti, daughter of former held Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, told the Press Trust of India: “Just because you’re the CM, it doesn’t mean you can pull off a woman’s hijab. Power doesn’t give you the right to humiliate Muslims. If you’re not well, please step down.”
Her mother also weighed in, tweeting: “Does one attribute it to old age or the normalisation of humiliating Muslims publicly. The fact that people around him watched this horrific incident unfold as some form of an entertainment is even more unsettling.”







Former Indian cricket team captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who currently serves as the Minister for Minority Welfare in Telangana state, told PTI: “Very sad to see this. A head of the state behaving in such a manner is unacceptable, and nobody should do this, not even someone in such a position. What has been done is a very bad act, and it is strongly condemned. Such actions should not be repeated, and appropriate action must be taken, because when the head behaves this way, it gives a wrong signal and encourages others in the state to do the same.”

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will roll out a locally developed secure messaging app, ‘Beep’, for government employees in the coming months, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecom was informed on Tuesday.
The committee was told that the app — inspired by the Chinese platform WeChat — is almost ready for launch and is expected to meet its project deadline of June 30, 2026.
National Information Technology Board (NITB) Chief Executive Faisal Iqbal Ratyal said Beep had been developed locally and certified by relevant government agencies for official use.
Committee Chairman Syed Aminul Haque directed the NITB to ensure the timely rollout of the application.
“The purpose of launching Beep is to provide a secure messaging platform for public sector employees nationwide,” Mr Ratyal told the committee. He said the launch would take place in phases, starting with federal ministries and attached departments.
He added that the rollout was expected to begin within the next two months and that the app would be integrated with Pakistan’s federal e-Office system, enabling secure messaging, document sharing and workflow coordination within government institutions.
According to the NITB, Beep will offer end-to-end encryption for text messages as well as video calls used by government officials.
Committee members raised concerns about data security and the protection of official communications, citing recent global incidents that underscored vulnerabilities in digital platforms. Mr Ratyal stressed that additional security features had been incorporated and that Beep’s encryption standards had been strengthened to make it suitable for sensitive discussions.

 

On operational costs, the NITB chief said the platform would operate on a usage-based fee model and efforts were under way to make it financially self-sustaining over time.
Secretary IT told the committee that revenue generation was not the primary objective and that the main priority remained secure, efficient and reliable communication across state institutions. The committee was also informed that the National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) had formally cleared the application for official deployment.
Members noted that WhatsApp, owned by Meta, remains the most widely used platform for voice calls, video calls and media sharing, but its data servers are located outside the country. Officials said Beep’s servers would be based in Pakistan, with stricter security safeguards inspired by WeChat.
The committee was also briefed that the federal e-Office system had been introduced to reduce paperwork and improve transparency, and that integrating Beep was expected to strengthen internal coordination and reduce operational risks.
PTA claim ‘incomprehensible’
In a separate discussion, lawmakers expressed a lack of confidence in Pakistan’s internet and telecom services and rejected the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s claim of 99 per cent user satisfaction.
Mr Haque challenged the PTA’s data presented in its Quality of Service report, which stated that mobile signal satisfaction stood at 99pc nationwide. Committee members unanimously rejected the figure, saying frequent internet slowdowns and weak mobile signals contradicted the regulator’s assessment. They described the claim as incomprehensible given prevailing conditions.
Committee member Sadiq Memon criticised the report and questioned the seriousness of the regulator’s approach, calling the findings “ridiculous” and warning that the gap between official reporting and public experience was widening.
Sharmila Faruqui questioned the methodology used by the PTA to compile its surveys and called for future Quality of Service assessments to be conducted by independent third parties rather than the regulator itself. She said external audits were necessary to improve credibility and ensure transparency.
The committee also recalled its earlier direction that the 5G spectrum auction be held in Pakistani rupees and that spectrum prices should not be set unnecessarily high. It directed that any discount or concession granted to telecom operators during the auction should be strictly linked to network and infrastructure improvements.
The committee also expressed concern over the absence of the director general of the Special Communications Organisation (SCO) for the third consecutive meeting.

Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, demanding their court-mandated meeting with the PTI founder.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in, which was later dispersed with water cannons.
Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained.
Some of the party workers were arrested but the number could not be confirmed.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters.
Meanwhile, in a post on social media platform X at 4am on Wednesday, the party’s central information department said that it condemned “in the harshest possible terms” the disregard of the IHC order and the “extreme state brutality” witnessed outside Adiala jail.
“These actions are not merely administrative failures; they constitute a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law, and the authority of the judiciary,” the party said, adding that the “willful defiance of judicial orders has effectively become official government policy”.







“At the behest of the government, the Punjab police crossed all limits of oppression by launching an assault using chemical-laced water cannons against Imran Khan’s sisters, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, other party leaders, PTI workers, and peaceful sit-in participants,” the party said.
“There was no emergency situation, no legal justification, and no provocation whatsoever. Despite this, women, elderly individuals, and peaceful protesters were subjected to chemical-infused water, physical violence, and the forcible arrest of multiple workers. This represents a textbook case of fascism, police brutality, and political victimisation at its worst,” it added.
The PTI said that such actions “clearly reflect the panic, insecurity, and moral bankruptcy of a deeply frightened government”. It further said that such “oppression, repression, and fascism cannot last forever”.
“History bears witness that no matter how powerful tyranny may appear, it ultimately meets its end. The day will surely come when those responsible for these unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane actions will be held fully accountable,” it added.
A video posted by the party on X showed a water cannon being used to disperse what appeared to be protesters as a large contingent of police stood on the side.







Another video posted by a party showed what appeared to be a drenched protester, saying that his “chest was burning” and his eyes were also affected.







In a separate video, Aleema, whose clothes were also drenched, looked at her hands and said, “They used a chemical, it is [burning] so much.”







“Poisonous, chemical-laced water was used,” party lawyer Naeem Panjutha said on X. He said that the water cannon was unleashed on the protesters, including Imran’s sisters and others.
“I myself fell; many workers fell; several were also arrested,” he said.







During the sit-in, some of the demonstrators had scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site. Some of the messages included the number “804”, which is reportedly Imran’s prisoner number.

‘Have no other option left besides protesting’
On Tuesday, Imran’s sisters had marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped”.
When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera.







Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurred every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that the protesters were not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities.
“We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.”
She claimed that the judiciary had been stripped of independence, unemployment was rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation was deteriorating.
Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to inform the family what was discussed.
“Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said.
Asked about a recent AI (artificial intelligence)-generated image of Imran in prison, which went viral, Aleema acknowledged she was not aware of artificial intelligence, but maintained that he looked the same as the person in the photograph as recently as October.
“Until two months ago, when we used to go visit the jail, the founder used to look exactly like this,” she said. “It may be AI, but it is the right AI.
“I don’t know what the prison looks like from the inside, but I can say that Imran Khan looked like this on October 16, the last time we met,” Aleema added.
She said that Imran told Uzma during their meeting that “the mental torture is far worse than the physical torture” and that he is being kept in solitary confinement.
“They think he will break, but Imran Khan is a man with faith in God. He will not break,” Aleema emphasised. “Imran Khan has said he is ready to accept death, but he will not be subdued by cruelty and injustice.”
She added that the government wants Imran to cut a deal with them, but insisted that he is not imprisoned for himself, but for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law.
Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening.
“We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib. Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.”







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder.
“This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what they can and cannot discuss in a meeting?”
However, the party’s secretary general gave a fiery response to a question, asking, “Do you think 20-30,000 people can overthrow a system that has been in place for the past 78 years?
“We are calling out to the entire nation. We do not want to carry on this drama for another day, after which people will die,” Raja said. “We will make a conscious effort and will not submit to pressure.”
He added that people’s consciences need to be shaken to ensure Imran’s release and said that the moment would come when hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets.







Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week.
She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned.







Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-17 02:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961621/transporters-hold-firm-as-talks-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters hold firm as talks continue</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Amid negotiations between goods transporters and government departments to resolve a nationwide strike that has entered its 10th day, industrialists warned on Tuesday that each passing day was adding billions of rupees in trade and export losses.
Transporters said talks were underway with representatives of the federal and Punjab governments and relevant departments, including the ministries of ports and shipping and communications, the motorway pol­i­ce, the National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) and senior officials of the Fede­ral Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs. They claimed the federal and Punjab governments had ackno­wledged that their demands were justified.
The negotiations were continuing late into the night and were ongoing at the time of going to press, officials said.
Earlier, transporters said the strike would continue until their dema­nds were accepted. The Transp­orters’ Goods Association (TGA) also told a Sindh government committee at the Commissioner’s Office in Karachi that the shutdown would remain in place until issues raised in its charter of demands were addressed. The demands include designated parking for goods carriers near Karachi Port Trust (KPT), and matters related to licensing and the plying of 25- to 30-year-old vehicles.

Industrialists urge PM to end goods transport shutdown as containers pile up

Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan
Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani described the halt in port activity as “economic sabotage” and said the strike had disrupted the national supply chain, pushing exports and imports towards a standstill.
He warned that exporters were being forced to consider costly and risky air consignments to meet delivery schedules and insisted that continued inaction could cause “heavy and irreparable” damage to the economy.
Mr Bilwani said port operations had come to a halt, leaving thousands of export and import containers stranded, while several hundred containers already loaded on vessels remained at sea, awaiting berthing space.
He cited Pakistan’s average daily exports at $92 million and monthly exports at $2.849 billion, adding that the textile sector alone accounted for $52m in daily exports and around $1.617bn per month.
He urged the prime minister to take notice and intervene to end the strike, saying it was necessary to protect exports and domestic commerce from further damage.
Atif Ikram Sheikh, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the transport strike was having serious negative consequences and freight forwarding at ports had been severely affected. He said imported goods were stuck at ports and exporters were unable to dispatch orders on time.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Muhammad Ikram Rajput said the delay in resolving issues between transporters and authorities had become unbearable for the industry. He said businesses were already grappling with high energy costs, elevated interest rates and weak demand, and the collapse of transport services had added further pressure.
Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PLGMEA) Chairman Nadeem Bukhari said that while efforts to improve road safety and regulatory compliance were welcome, the sudden disruption in freight movement had created significant operational challenges for export-oriented industries.
Medicine supplies disrupted
The strike has also begun disrupting the supply of essential medicines across the country, with shortages reported in several cities and towns as pharmaceutical products from major manufacturing hubs fail to reach pharmacies, medical stores and healthcare facilities, industry and market representatives said.
They said medicines produced in Karachi and Lahore were not being transported to other parts of the country, warning that a prolonged disruption could create serious difficulties for patients, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses.
Tauqeerul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said pharmaceutical companies had received reports of shortages from different regions as manufacturers were unable to dispatch products from industrial centres.
He said stocks of medicines used for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions were running low, while demand had risen due to a flu outbreak. He added that many manufacturers had slowed or stopped production as warehouses reached capacity and finished goods could not be moved, while raw materials required for production were also failing to reach factories.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, also stressed that transporters were not delivering medicines to different parts of the country and pharmacists were receiving complaints from patients unable to find essential drugs.
Balochistan has been the worst-affected province, according to Malik Roohullah Kakar, president of the Medicines Traders Association of Balochistan. He said that around 80 per cent of medicines used in the province are supplied from Karachi, and the transporters’ strike had led to shortages in Quetta and other towns across Balochistan.

The order implies that if a victim conformed to a certain moral or societal expectation, the crime could have been avoided. The reasoning shifts the focus away from the perpetrator’s culpability and onto the victim’s character and choices. It perpetuates a culture in which women are held responsible for the violence inflicted upon them. Victims are expected to predict, prevent, and bear responsibility for the violence committed against them.
According to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation, 32,617 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) were reported in 2024 including 2,238 incidents of domestic violence and 547 cases of ‘honour’ killings. Women are subjected to violence not because they deviate from ‘norms’, but often precisely within those conventional and domestic spaces — inside their homes and at the hands of family members. To claim that the crime is the result of ‘live-in’ or a specific kind of a relationship demonstrates ignorance and dangerously reinforces victim-blaming. Cases of GBV must not be converted into a moral discussion. Nor should a victim’s life be reduced to a cautionary tale for society. The presence of such a Supreme Court order signals to the entire judicial hierarchy that moral commentary in cases of GBV is acceptable when it should have no place in our legal system. Rather than rejecting narratives that justify violence, the same harmful logic is being embedded in an order.
In contrast, in 2021, in ‘Atif Zareef vs the State’, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah held: “A woman, whatever her sexual character or reputation may be, is entitled to equal protection of law. No one has the licence to invade her person … it is the accused who is on trial and not the victim.” Placed side by side, the difference in the two judgements is stark. One judgement uses a judicial order to blame a victim, the other dismantles those very prejudices. One judgement shifts respon-
sibility away from the perpetrator, the other makes it unmistakably clear that the victim is not on trial. One judgement reduces the victim to a moral lesson, the other reaffirms her right to dignity.
During the hearings of the case, similar remarks were reported in the press. However, the ‘remarks’ now form part of a judicial order. The order creates a hierarchy of victims; those deemed ‘deserving’ of sympathy and those who are deemed to have ‘brought it upon themselves’. In a country where there is already severe underreporting, the order may further lead to victims choosing silence over the risk of being blamed for the violence against them.

GBV cases mustn’t be converted into moral debates.

Justice Najafi is one of seven judges that has been appointed to the Federal Constitutional Court. In the post-27th Amendment constitutional order, the FCC has the final say on constitutional interpretation. The FCC can, through the stroke of a pen, undo well-settled jurisprudence. The 27th Amendment does not specify criteria for appointment of judges to the FCC. The first batch of judges essentially hold their position by virtue of the executive selecting them.
Prior to the destructive 26th and 27th amendments, Pakistan was to have its first female chief justice in 2030. Previously, on the basis of seniority, the most senior judge of the court would have taken oath as chief justice and the executive had no say in the process. Under the bizarre new system, there are two chief justices: a chief justice of the FCC and a chief justice of the Supreme Court. Per the amendments, the FCC and SC chief justices are to be chosen by a parliamentary committee which shall have proportional representation based on the strength in parliament, and will select the chief justices from the three senior-most judges. Without government support in the committee, an eligible judge will not succeed in becoming chief justice of either court. Government approval has become a decisive factor in determining which judge becomes chief justice.
And with that, the once-certain prospect that Pakistan was on track to have its first female chief justice is no longer there. A previously guaranteed milestone has been made subject to the whims of political power. While representation alone cannot transform an institution, it remains an important advancement for women in the judiciary. Meaningful change requires strengthening institutions, not tearing them down. For far too long, unconscious bias against women has plagued our judicial system; the amendments entrench further injustice.

For a thousand years, the memory of Punjab lived in breath and melody rather than ink. From the salt hills of Soon Valley to the barley fields of Sargodha, every village once kept its history inside the heads and hearts of its mirasis [musicians], qissakhwaan and dastaangos [bards and storytellers].
Their stage was the dera [gathering place] or chaupaal [pavilion] under a peepal tree or outside the village mosque, where men gathered on charpais [woven jute beds] after evening prayer. In the parallel women’s spaces — the aangan [courtyard], the chhapparr [thatched hut], the rooftop terraces — grandmothers ruled the night with the same authority as queens.

For a thousand years, Punjab kept its history in song, not script. Now, fewer than a dozen people can still perform the epic tales that once filled every village square. This is the story of what we’re losing, and the unexpected voices trying to save it…

The great lok dastaans [folk tales] were the pillars of this living library: Heer Ranjha (dozens of oral versions long before Waris Shah put pen to paper), Sassi Punnu (originally a Sindhi and Balochi legend, later adapted to Punjabi oral tradition), Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahiwal, Puran Bhagat, Dulla Bhatti, Kaulan Rasalu and countless local heroes. Around them circled shorter stories, Bulleh Shah’s kafiyaan [spiritual poetry], seasonal barah-maha [twelve months] songs, wedding sohile [emotional songs for bride] and the long shajras [genealogy] recited at every nikaah to trace a family back to its saint or tribe.
Women kept their own parallel epics alive. In the Seraiki belt, only a handful of elderly women in remote villages of Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan still remember the complete cycle of suhaag and ghorriyaan [traditional Punjabi wedding folk songs] that used to accompany a bride from her parents’ home to her in-laws’ over seven nights.
In Potohar and the Salt Range, the sharp-tongued mahiye and tappay [fast-paced celebratory songs] once traded between rival clans at weddings have almost vanished; the last full-performance recording Lok Virsa — the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage — managed was in 1998.
THE LAST VOICES
Two living legends still carry the male tradition, though both know the fire is low.
In Mochiwala near Multan, Ustad Fazal Abbas (born 1946), from a hereditary mirasi lineage, is the last man in southern Punjab who can perform the complete 48-hour Dulla Bhatti — about a Punjabi Robin Hood who rebelled against Emperor Akbar — without a written line. His voice, roughened by decades of hookah and winter nights, still fills the small dera beside the village shrine every Thursday.
In 2023, he began teaching his two teenage grandsons, but they leave for factory jobs in Faisalabad every Sunday morning.
Seven hours north, in Adda Jahan Khan near Bhakkar, Ustad Sharif Ahmed Qissakhwaan (born 1942) keeps alive the 36-hour oral cycle of Raja Rasalu, another folktale. Every spring, on the urs [death anniversary] of a local saint, he sits beneath an ancient ber [jujube] tree and sings from sunset to sunrise. Farmers still bring him food, but the audience rarely exceeds 30 people, and most are over 50.
“The young ones record me on their phones,” he says with a tired smile, “but they do not learn with their hearts.”
These two men are among fewer than a dozen traditional performers still left in the province (Lok Virsa internal survey, 2022). In Punjab’s villages, electricity arrived in the 1980s, television in the 1990s, smartphones after 2010. Farm debt and city jobs pulled young men away.
Centuries-old caste prejudice, which labels hereditary musicians as of “low” social standing, now pushes their descendants to take up welding or driving instead. The pandemic years of 2020–2022 cancelled weddings and festivals; many elders died without apprentices at their side.
IMPERFECT RESURRECTIONS
Yet sometimes, in the middle of our loud, forgetful cities, the desert still speaks.
A young Urdu literature professor and poet, who signs his name “Imran Feroze”, has written a Sassi that no village grandmother ever sang, yet every line feels older than Bhambore itself. He gives voice to Sassi after she has become sand and memory, after her body is gone, after even her grief has turned into dunes. Here is a fragment of what she says to Punnu from the other side of death:
[What is the point of returning now Punal?Love has been buried in the khanzada’s harem nowNow a shroud of dust covers every dream of minePunal, do not call out…For every voice is a wound.Punal, turn back and goHere nothing remains except theblood-soaked sand]
When I first read those lines, I heard the same ache I hear in Ustad Fazal Abbas’ cracked voice. The tradition is not only dying, it is also — against all odds — being reborn in new throats that never sat on a charpai under a peepal tree.
That is the other half of the story we rarely tell: that a few young people are still trying, however imperfectly. In a government girls’ school in Faisalabad, Ayesha Parveen keeps 20 students after the bell, teaching them fragments of Sohni Mahiwal in Seraiki. The girls love it — until parents arrive, complaining that the time would be better spent prepping for college entrance tests.
In a narrow lane of Lahore, 24-year-old Hamza Ali once recorded a three-minute Heer on his phone, added beats and played it for cousins. The elders called it disrespectful, so he deleted it the same night. Now, every Friday, he sits with his grandfather, recording the old man’s raw, unfiltered Mirza Sahiban and sends the clips to a group of friends with the same plea: “This is the real thing. Listen before it’s gone.”
PROTECTING A VANISHING ART
Saving what remains is still possible, but the clock is brutal. The Punjab government once paid a modest Rs8,000 monthly stipend to recognised folk artists; the scheme quietly died in 2018. Reviving and raising the stipend to at least Rs40,000, tied to compulsory teaching of two apprentices — as has been proposed by the Punjab government — would cost less than one kilometre of the metro bus track and secure more living heritage than any museum.
Lok Virsa’s thousands of reel-to-reel hours remain largely undigitised; a proper, publicly accessible Shahmukhi [Punjabi script] archive with melody, dialect notes and performer genealogies is long overdue.
Even the language is flattening. The rich, rolling Multani of Sassi’s desert and the hard consonants of Potohari Rasalu are being replaced by textbook Urdu or the clipped Punjabi of short-form video. In schools, children study eight couplets of Waris Shah’s Heer in grade 10, never told that the full oral versions once ran to 6,000, changing with every teller, every season, every heartbreak in the audience.
Until serious steps are taken, two old men — one in Mochiwala and the other in Adda Jahan Khan — will keep singing to a shrinking circle, beneath the same moon that once listened to Ranjha. And somewhere in a Lahore flat, a young poet will write lines that taste of sand and eternal waiting.
When all the old voices finally stop, the rivers will still flow, the peepal trees will still stand, but maybe, just maybe, a Punjab older than writing will still find new tongues willing to remember its songs.
