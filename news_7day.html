The development comes within weeks of the Indian political and military leadership making aggressive statements, repeating its terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted. The Pakistani military had, in response, warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation”.
Yesterday, Indian Army’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai claimed that the Indian Navy was fully prepared during ‘Operation Sindoor’, the term New Delhi used for its May 7 strikes on Pakistan. He further said that any further hostilities by Pakistan could have been “catastrophic for it”, Times of India reported.
Lt Gen Ghai claimed that more than 100 Pakistani soldiers were killed during the May conflict along the Line of Control, The Hindu reported. The Indian officer also reiterated India’s claim of inflicting major damage on Pakistani airbases and destroying its air assets on the ground.
“The contradictions in the Indian Army presser are so evident that they should not be dignified with a response. Evidently, the Indian leadership is attempting to mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts,” said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“It appears that [the] Indian army and the political leadership have not been able to reconcile with the idea that they have been decisively beaten in Marka-i-Haq, and that their falsehoods have been fully exposed,” it added.
 
 

The military’s media affairs wing noted with grave concern that five months after the May conflict, “in the run-up to elections in Bihar and West Bengal, Indian military leadership has started parroting the same delusional, fabricated and provocative propaganda that they regurgitate before every state election in India”.
“It is saddening to see the military leadership of a nuclear-armed country issuing irresponsible statements under immense political pressure. The lies being fed to the Indian public and international audience have turned the Indian military machine into a laughing stock,” the statement said.
The ISPR cautioned that “any professional soldier would know that unnecessary chest thumping and unwarranted statements might initiate a cycle of jingoism and lead to serious consequences for peace and stability in South Asia”.
It asserted that the world now recognises India as the “true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, bent upon adventurism and hegemonism to the detriment of its people and its neighbours”.
 
 

The ISPR stressed that the “Indian armed forces and its political masters must realise that Pakistan’s people and its armed forces are fully capable and committed to defend every inch of our territory with full resolve”.
“Every act of aggression will be dealt with a swift, resolute and intense response that will be remembered by posterity,” the military affirmed.
The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after its three air bases were targeted.</p><small>2025-10-15 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/151136167599137.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949072/former-sindh-assembly-speaker-agha-siraj-durrani-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh Assembly speaker Agha Siraj Durrani passes away</strong></a><br><p>PPP leader and former speaker of the Sindh Assembly Agha Siraj Durrani, passed away on Wednesday, according to a statement by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
In a statement issued by the Sindh CM House, Shah expressed deep sorrow and grief over Durrani’s passing. Murad called Durrani “a sincere, loyal and principled leader of the party, saying he played an important role in strengthening the Sindh Assembly and stabilising democracy.
“Agha Siraj Durrani made public service the axis of his politics,” he said, expressing his condolences to the bereaved family.
“The services of the late Agha Siraj Durrani will always be remembered,” he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed “deep sorrow” over Durrani’s passing.
“The president paid tribute to his political and public services, noting his role in strengthening democracy and serving the people of Sindh,” said a post by the Presidency on social media platform X.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the late Durrani for his services as the Sindh Assembly speaker, saying that his contributions to politics and public welfare would “always be remembered”, APP reported.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X, also expressed his sorrow at Durrani’s passing, calling him an “honourable man who stood by the PPP and the leadership during the toughest of times”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said Durrani was a “wise and astute politician”, saying that his services for the promotion and strengthening of democracy would be remembered.
“The void created by the passing of Agha Siraj Durrani will not be filled for a long time,” Sadiq added.

Imran’s remarks come after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday vowed the country would not ‘mortgage’ the security of its people with any country.
“Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he said during a press conference in Peshawar, where he spoke at length about the prevailing security environment in KP.
The DG ISPR sounded aggressive when asked about calls by Imran — who is currently in jail — to seek direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to end bloodshed in the province ruled by his political party. “The state of Pakistan and its armed forces would not be bothered by political distortions,” he asserted.
“The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible man for bringing terrorism back to KP,” the ISPR chief said, without taking any names. He had also picked holes in what he called “governance gaps” in the province in terms of infrastructure and funding for counter-terrorism efforts.
In a message posted on Imran’s official X account last night, the PTI founder congratulated KP MPAs over the transition in governance following Sohail Afridi’s election as the new chief minister.
“The way members of the KP Assembly voted for my nominated chief minister, without any ifs or buts, is commendable,” he said.
He also paid tribute to outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who resigned “not once but thrice” without any hesitation.
 






He also gave a special message to the new KP chief minister, calling him his “opening batsman” and telling him to play as such.
“The PTI is the largest political party in Pakistan. Branding people associated with the party as traitors just because they do not agree with a certain policy is an extremely dangerous act,” Imran said, calling for an end to the practice of labelling people as “anti-state”.
“As a politician, it is my right to criticise any policy that is against the interest of the people, the country’s integrity and democracy. I have and will continue to oppose every policy against national interests,” the ex-premier said.
“The PTI has been given a mandate by the people of KP and we are answerable to them, not the DG ISPR. Therefore, we will never go against the interests of the people of Pakistan and the province,” he added.
Imran asserted that he did not have an enmity with the army, saying: “The army is mine, the country is mine and its people are also mine.”
 
 

He went on to say that several members of his family were part of the armed forces, adding that he felt sorrow when soldiers were martyred while fighting against terrorism.
“But unrest still persists and our people are killed on both sides,” he said.
“History has proven that military operations alone are not the solution for terrorism. Our principled position is that military operations in KP are unacceptable because innocent people are martyred in the name of ‘collateral damage’ and are displaced from their areas,” Imran said.
“For decades, military operations are being conducted but this scourge still remains. Every year, precious blood is being spilt; sometimes army and police personnel are martyred, other times innocent civilians lose their lives in terrorist incidents,” he added.
“I have always said that in order to completely eradicate terrorism, an effective, comprehensive strategy based on political insight is needed instead of decisions taken behind closed doors,” he said. The PTI founder further said that any policy made without the input and consultation of political representatives and the KP government was unacceptable.
Imran asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the KP government, the federal government or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” he said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.
Imran’s statement comes after Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The ISPR said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Fighting flared up again last night between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in KP’s Kurram district, state media reported.</p><small>2025-10-15 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14175537efed823.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948890/bilawal-asks-kundi-to-fulfil-constitutional-responsibility-administer-oath-to-afridi' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal asks Kundi to fulfil ‘constitutional responsibility’, administer oath to Afridi</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday asked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi to fulfil his “constitutional and legal responsibility” in accordance with today’s court order and return to his province to administer the oath to CM-elect Sohail Afridi.
“You should go to KP. I will ask the Sindh chief minister to lend you his plane so you can reach KP and fulfil your constitutional and legal responsibility in accordance with the court’s order,” said the PPP chairman while addressing a seminar in Karachi.
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) directed Kundi today to administer the chief minister’s oath to Afridi tomorrow by 4pm. The court’s decision, which was reserved earlier today, came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath.

In an apparent dig at the Punjab government, Bilawal stated that the PPP is competing internationally and not with any city or province of Pakistan.
Bilawal said the Khairpur Special Economic Zone, established during the tenure of former Sindh chief minister Qaim Ali Shah, had earned international recognition.
He noted that Financial Times had also included the special economic zone among the world’s leading export zones in its Global Free Zones of the Year 2025 awards.
“In the Asia-Pacific category, while the Freeport Area of Bataan was ranked first, Khairpur’s zone was named the runner-up,” he said, adding that “our competition is not with any other city or province, we are competing with the world.”
The PPP scion also noted that the success of the economic zone was not an isolated case, adding that Sindh had also led the way in introducing the concept of public-private partnerships in Pakistan, an idea first outlined in the PPP’s 1993 manifesto by Benazir Bhutto.
 






“At that time too, our competition wasn’t with any city or province in Pakistan, it was with the world. This is your success, and this is Pakistan’s success,” he added.
The PPP and PML-N were engaged in a war of words over flood relief as  Bilawal asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Giving further examples of the progress made in Sindh, Bilawal said the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), which provides free treatment, performs the highest number of cardiac procedures in the world.
He added that even in the case of cancer treatment, “In this very city, we offer free cancer treatment, something that is among the costliest procedures in the world. Yet, it is available for free only here, in Karachi. This too is Pakistan’s success,” he said.
Talking about BISP, Bilawal said, “When I was the foreign minister and met leaders from various countries from Africa to Egypt and beyond, they would tell me they were replicating the BISP model,” Bilawal said.</p><small>2025-10-15 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1508222297b8e6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948975/gloves-come-off-as-hearing-on-26th-amendment-turns-heated' target='_blank'><strong>Gloves come off as hearing on 26th Amendment turns heated</strong></a><br><p>• Justice Mandokhail’s observation that both amendment and SC Rules are silent on ‘full court’ stirs hornets’ nest
• Justice Hilali, attorney general advise bench not to debate internal matters in open court
ISLAMABAD: Divergent positions during the hearing of challen­ges to the 26th Amendment before the eight-judge constitutional bench on Tuesday stripped away the usual veneer of collegiality among judges, exposing simmering tensions within the Supreme Court.
At the heart of the disagreement were discussions surrounding the adoption of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, and the formation of a full court to hear the constitutional challenges.
Senior counsel Abid Shahid Zuberi, representing former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), argued that the full court should comprise all 16 judges who were part of the apex court when the 26th Amendment was passed by parliament.
However, members of the eight-judge bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, repeatedly questioned how they could order the formation of a full court, when neither the constitutional amendment nor the newly adopted court rules provided guidance on such a matter.
The proceedings grew heated, prompting Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to intervene, urging the court not to air its internal judicial matters in open court.
Debate over composition
Tensions first surfaced when Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, addressing the counsel, asked him to clarify his position, since he was advocating for a full court while also insisting that it should comprise only 16 judges, even though the present strength of the Supreme Court stands at 24 judges.
“The counsel should propose a way forward — how can this bench order the constitution of a full court?” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
When Justice Ayesha A. Malik in­­terjected and recalled previous ju­­d­gements, which held that when a par­­ticular constitutional provision was under challenge, it could be disregarded until its legality was determined, Justice Mandokhail retor­t­­ed, “Let the counsel respond to the query.”
Citing the Practice and Procedure judgment, Mr Zuberi explained that the current constitutional bench comprised eight judges, while its total sanctioned strength was 15. Consequently, the right of intra-court appeal against a decision of the current bench might not be available, since at least nine different judges would be required to hear such an appeal.
Justice Malik observed that the Practice and Procedure ruling had provided a mechanism — empowering the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to decide whether to grant or deny the right of appeal. “If the Commission wishes to allow it, it can nominate additional judges to enhance the bench’s strength. And if it does not agree, the right can be withheld,” she explained.
Justice Mandokhail, however, disagreed, asserting that even if a full court of 16 judges were constituted, the right of appeal would still not apply to its decisions.
Mr Zuberi said that it had been held in the Practice and Procedure case that when the entire court sits en banc, no appeal was necessary as the collective wisdom of all judges was already represented.
Adoption of SC rules
Justice Mandokhail said both Ar­­ticle 191A of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Rules 2025 were silent on the precise composition of a full court. He noted that when the full court, on the administrative side, approved the new rules, the requirement of collective decision-making had already been fulfilled.
The observation, however, stirred controversy.
Justice Malik said no discussion had taken place when the rules were approved, rather they were adopted through circulation, and her dissenting note was on the record. She suggested that the minutes of the process be called to verify how the rules had been passed.
However, Justice Mandokhail insisted that bench formation would proceed strictly in accordance with the new rules.
 
 

Mr Zuberi referred to Order 11 of the SC Rules, arguing that the three-judge committee under the Practice and Procedure Act was responsible for constituting benches. Justice Mandokhail, however, pointed out that nowhere in the rules was it stated that benches would be formed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), adding that the rules were finalised in the presence of all 24 judges.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar agreed with Justice Malik’s observation that the rules had been app­r­oved through circulation. Justice Ma­­­ndokhail maintained that all judges had been asked to give their input. “Are you calling for the reco­rds or not?” Justice Malik asked, turning towards the head of the bench.
Sensing the growing tension, Justice Mussarat Hilali advised her colleagues to lower their voices and move forward calmly.
“This case will not proceed further until it becomes clear how the rules were adopted,” Justice Mando­khail remarked sharply. “If I am being contradicted, I will place everything before the entire nation.”
Justice Hilali replied humorously that the “entire nation” was not watching since the live-streaming of the hearing was unavailable. Justice Mazhar then instructed court staff to fix the technical fault immediately.
The tense exchanges prompted the attorney general to return to the rostrum, urging the judges to refrain from debating internal court matters in open proceedings. Later, the court staff informed the bench that live-streaming had been restored.

If approved, the IMF will provide Pakistan $1bn under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $200 million under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about $3.3bn.
Last week, an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova had concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on the second review of the EFF — agreed in 2024 to shore up the economy after a severe financial crisis — and the first one for the RSF climate loan.
The mission had left Pakistan without signing a staff-level agreement. However, the Fund had said “significant progress” had been made towards reaching the deal. A day earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb — who is currently in Washington — had expressed the hope that the agreement would be reached this week.
In a statement issued early on Wednesday by the Fund, Petrova stated that the staff-level agreement remained subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board.
“Supported by the EFF, Pakistan’s economic programme is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,” she said.
“The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus — the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the programme target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,” she said.
However, the IMF official added, the recent floods had weighed on the country’s outlook, particularly of the agriculture sector, bringing down the projected FY26 gross domestic product (GDP) to about 3.25-3.5 per cent.
“The floods underscore Pakistan’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and substantial climate-related risks, and the continuing need to build climate resilience,” Petrova said.
She also said that the Fund wanted to express its sympathy to those affected by the recent floods, adding that it was “grateful to the Pakistani authorities, private sector, and development partners for many fruitful discussions and their hospitality throughout this mission”.
‘Pakistan reaffirmed commitment to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing reforms’
The IMF official also noted progress on Pakistan’s policy priorities, saying: “The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF and RSF-supported programmes, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms.”
She said that authorities remained committed to meeting the FY26 budget primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP, anchored in sustained efforts to mobilise revenue through tax policy and compliance measures, and “stand ready to take necessary actions should revenue shortfalls risk program targets”.
“At the same time, the authorities are assessing the flood damage and are providing urgent flood relief support in the affected provinces via reallocations in the provincial and federal budgets,” Petrova said.
She also noted that social protection remained a key pillar of the EFF-supported programme and authorities were working on enhancing the generosity, coverage and administrative capacity of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
“They are also committed to scaling up non-BISP health and education spending at both the federal and provincial levels to support inclusive growth and safeguard vulnerable populations,” she said.
She further said that efforts were underway to enhance revenue mobilisation, broaden burden-sharing between federal and provincial governments, and strengthen public financial management.
“In particular, recognising the provinces’ vital role in domestic revenue mobilisation, the federal authorities will continue deepening collaboration with provincial counterparts.
“The authorities are also making important progress in strengthening tax policy design, with the newly established tax policy office, which will lead medium-term reforms to simplify the tax code and reduce reliance on ad hoc measures,” she said.
The IMF official noted that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was committed to a prudent monetary policy stance, guided by incoming data, including the impact of recent floods and the evolving economic recovery, to ensure inflation remains durably within its target range of five to seven per cent.
“While the floods are likely to have a temporary impact on prices, the SBP stands ready to adjust its policy stance should price pressures intensify or inflation expectations become unanchored. While the sustained buildup of international reserves is welcome, further steps are needed to deepen the foreign exchange market to facilitate transactions, support price discovery, and cushion external shocks,” she said.
On the issue of circular debt, she said that Pakistan remained committed to preventing its accumulation through timely tariff adjustments that ensure cost recovery and maintaining a progressive tariff structure.
“Structural reforms continue to focus on enhancing the performance, efficiency, and governance of distribution companies, including through privatisation; upgrading the transmission system; privatising inefficient generation companies; and completing the transition to a competitive electricity market,” Petrova said.
She further said that authorities were making progress in delivering structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity, strengthening governance, and improving the business environment to support private sector development.
“Further effort is needed to advance the state-owned enterprise reform agenda and scale back the state’s footprint in the economy. The authorities are also planning reforms to reduce government intervention in commodity markets to foster a productive, diversified, and internationally competitive agricultural sector that meets food security needs. Efforts to boost international trade continue, including with the implementation of the new national tariff policy,” she said.
Petrova went on to say that the recent floods and those of 2022 had underscored the need for building Pakistan’s climate resilience.
“Policies supported by the RSF and aligned with national commitments are helping to strengthen resilience, including recently implemented reforms to promote green mobility and transport decarbonisation,” she noted.
“The authorities remain committed to advancing future reforms, including strengthening the climate information architecture and financial risk management, improving water system resilience, establishing a framework for coordinated disaster risk financing, and aligning energy sector reforms with national mitigation commitments,” she added.</p><small>2025-10-15 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68eebcd761a3b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948940/transgender-community-decries-police-led-evictions-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Transgender community decries ‘police-led evictions’ in KP</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Leaders of transgender persons on Tuesday accused the police of evicting their community members from various districts of the province.
They also complained about the police’s failure to act against extortionists, kidnappers and the killers of transgender persons across the province.
Addressing a press conference at Peshawar Press Club, Transgender Community Organisation president Farzana Riaz condemned “persecution” of her community.
Accompanied by vice president of the organisation Mahi Gul, she said that despite numerous appeals for justice, the killers, extortionists and kidnappers of transgender persons were roaming free, often under police protection, but the police were busy evicting her community members from their homes.

Complains about lack of action against kidnappers, killers of its members

“Transgender persons have repeatedly been targeted with death threats and extortion calls, and those who refused to pay were killed.
“We are not asking for charity or police ration packages; we are demanding our legitimate right to live,” she said.
Farzana Riaz lamented that despite court cases, police officers and influential people had joined hands to forcibly remove transgender persons from Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda and other areas in the province.
“It seems as we are citizens of an enemy country, so we’re being treated like that,” she said.
The organisation leader said when her community’s members approached the relevant government offices for support, they’re turned away.
She, however, said the Peshawar High Court heard the community’s plea and stopped forced evictions.
“The court had sought an explanation from the provincial inspector general of police and the capital city police officer but the latter have yet to submit a response despite multiple hearings, with the court granting them time until November 4,” she said.
According to Farzana Riaz, police officials in multiple districts held meetings with local elders and clerics, encouraging them to drive transgender persons out of their communities.
“In places like Swabi, transgender women such as Naseema were given 15 days to leave their homes and were physically assaulted before being expelled,” she said.
 
 

She said such incidents were reported in Charsadda, Mingora, Haripur, Buner and Nowshera as well.
Farzana Riaz alleged that police often demanded participation in their events or private functions, and those who refused faced harassment and eviction.
 
 

“We approached every institution but justice remains elusive,” she said.
Farzana Riaz complained that six years ago, the PTI government announced special hospital wards for transgender persons but they continued to be examined in general wards for men.
She added that the government didn’t keep its promise of providing jobs to her community on the pretext of data unavailability.
Mahi Gul said that the Peshawar High Court had ordered police not to evict any transgender person and ensure their basic human rights.
“We only seek dignity and humanity,” she said.
She condemned announcements from mosques for targeting transgender persons.
Mahi Gul said her community helped police eliminate drug trafficking and other crimes but even then, it was subjected to eviction.
She demanded intervention of the provincial police chief to check violation of her community’s rights in Swabi and Nowshera.

But in the case of Panjnad Barrage, they do. From Jalalpur Pirwala to Shujabad, people have spoken of the same strange sight during the last floods: the river flow was super slow. A peak flood wave that previously would cross the barrage in a few days, now lingered. One peak remained high for four to five days, and even after falling, the river stayed at flood-level flow for nearly 20 days.
Though there were indeed two flood peaks, this unexplained sluggishness left upstream areas inundated for much longer than expected. Jalalpur Pirwala town in particular bore the brunt. Why did the flood ebb so slowly, and who was responsible? An independent inquiry committee must be set up immediately to find out.
We should recall that rehabilitation and remodelling works on the barrage were completed as recently as March 2025. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the joint rehabilitation of Trimmu and Panjnad Barrages involved a loan of millions of dollars. These works were mea­nt to enable the barrage to allow a flood of 850,000 cusecs to pass safely and smoothly. Yet, flood peaks stayed mostly around 550,000 to 680,000 cusecs — high enough to cause the water to head up and pass sluggishly. What went wrong with a structure recently overhauled for enhanced flood levels?
The official design documents describe the chosen interventions in detail. The major works included: strengthening and replacement of gates, construction of a new stilling basin with a reinforced end sill, and the addition of “four depressed bays utilising the existing junction groyne with increased High Flood Level [HFL]”. The same report says: “River training embankments will be remodelled according to the raised HFL.” Briefly, the new design accepted a deliberate raising of the HFL upstream.
Here lies the core issue. As floodwaters have to rise higher upstream before depressed bays and end sills can work effectively, the river’s slope flattens and its speed decreases. Instead of rushing past, the flow starts to crawl. Combined with a concrete divide wall that alters flow patterns and adds turbulence, the entire system risks behaving like a secondary weir. Far from aiding the flood passage, these structures may have, inadvertently, throttled it. The result is prolonged inundation, higher upstream levels and misery for people in Jalalpur Pirwala and beyond.

What went wrong with a structure recently overhauled for enhanced flood levels?

Some explanation of these technical terms is ne­­­eded. A depressed bay is a lowered gate bay mea­­nt to allow more water. If too few are provi­d­­ed, or if they are not deep enough, they only start operating when the water has risen dangerously. An end sill is a raised block at the end of the stilling basin to control the hydraulic jump; if too high or abrupt, it acts like a mini-dam. A divide wall separates different bay flows; if extended im­­p­r­o­perly, it can create eddies and backpressure.
Col­lectively, these features can raise upstre­­am water levels instead of lowering them. The ADB re­­port itself concedes that the selected opt­ion in­­volved “increased HFL”. This is a smoking gun: the risk of upstream flooding was built into the design.
The case of Panjnad is not isolated. South Asia has a long history of engineering ‘solutions’ that turn into disasters. The World Bank-financed Left Bank Outfall Drain failed to drain stormwater and worsened sea intrusion in Sindh’s tidal reg­ions. The ADB-funded Chashma Right Bank Can­al Phase III had faulty cross-drainage and flood carrier channels; and hill torrents in 2022 dro­wned Taunsa Sharif.
Similarly, the World Bank-financed Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation Project added a secondary weir downstream, which pro­ved to be a blockage and broke the left marginal bund, submerging Kot Addu and Muzaffargarh during the 2010 flood. These failures were later partially acknowledged by World Bank and ADB inspection panels. Yet, people continue to pay the price through floods, lost livelihoods and the very loans that financed these disasters.
 
 

We now see the same pattern in Panjnad’s case. The rehabilitation design that was supposed to secure 850,000 cusecs has faltered even under 680,000 cusecs. The specific choices — depressed bays in the groyne, a reinforced end sill, and a divide wall — may have combined to slow the river and raise the HFL. Millions have been affected, and once again, foreign loans will have to be repaid for a project that may have worsened the disaster instead of preventing it.
Similarly, the case of the construction of the motorway across the drainage plains where the Sutlej and Chenab meet upstream of Panjnad Barrage is also intriguing. It has complicated and prolonged the flood event. The motorway obstruc­ted the natural cross-drainage of the Sutlej, slowing its flow, forcing massive silt deposition, and eventually diverting the river’s course towards the eastern side of Jalapur town. This created breaches in the motorway at several points, leading to extended closures and inundation of lands that had never been flooded before.
The trapped water formed an artificial lake stretching 12 to 15 kilometres. So, why did the motorway’s design fail to account for the cross-drainage challenges of this complex hydrological region? Why was a route chosen through flood-prone terrain instead of the safer eastern corridor along the railway and National Highway? These questions again expose systemic failure in infrastructure planning — projects conceived in offices without field-level understanding of the local geography, river behaviour, or community vulnerability.
Accountability is essential. An independent inquiry must assess the role of barrage remodelling and construction of the motorway in the complex Panjnad hydrology in this prolonged flood. But beyond accountability lies a larger question: must we continue with our colonial-era hydraulic thinking that treats rivers as machines to be throttled?
The Indus basin needs not just barrages and loans; it needs a new imagination of river ecology. Natural drainage must be restored, rivers must be given more room, and climate change adaptation must be central to planning. Above all, local communities and regions like Seraiki Wasaib must have autonomy to shape their water future, instead of being drowned in the name of mega development and infrastructure projects.

It was not the first time both forces have clashed, but the latest fighting was certainly the fiercest.
For several hours Pakistan’s ground and air force pounded targets inside Afghanistan along the entire stretch of the long border. It was said to be in response to the attack on Pakistani border posts by Taliban forces. Heavy casualties have been reported on both sides. The latest round of skirmishes started after Pakistan Air Force jets and drones reportedly struck alleged militant sanctuaries across the border.
The main targets of the airstrikes were believed to be TTP leaders, particularly Noor Wali Mehsud, the alleged mastermind of the recent attacks on Pakistani security forces. There are conflicting reports about whether he was killed in the raid.
Although Pakistan did not say if it was behind the blasts in Kabul and other places, it has repeatedly declared that the country has the right to defend itself against surging cross-border militant attacks on its security forces. In this month alone scores of Pakistan security personnel, including army officers, have been martyred in the attacks by various factions of the TTP. This year has been the bloodiest in the past decade.

The worsening conflict between the two neighbours carries serious implications for regional security.

It seems Pakistan has lost patience with the Afghan Taliban administration refusing to act against the TTP sanctuaries being used to stage cross-border attacks. The tension further heightened after Pakistan claimed it had evidence about Afghan Taliban men also being involved in some of the terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.
It was not the first time the PAF has targeted militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan — some of which were officially acknowledged — but the latest strikes were said to be the most devastating. Declaring the incursion as an attack on Afghanistan’s sovereignty, Taliban forces retaliated by attacking multiple Pakistani security border posts, claiming to have killed dozens of soldiers.
The fighting has stopped but the situation remains extremely volatile. The borders are closed completely, stopping trade and travel between both countries. The worsening conflict between the two neighbouring nations carries serious implications for regional security.
Interestingly, the latest clashes occurred when some positive developments had taken place after Ishaq Dar’s recent visit to Kabul, and Pakistan had decided to upgrade diplomatic relations between the two countries. China also played a significant role in cooling the tension. Kabul and Islamabad had since been holding regular official-level talks to ease tension.
Meanwhile, Islamabad had also decided to reopen some of the trading routes closed down for months. The two foreign ministers had recently met under the aegis of the so-called Moscow Format on Afghanistan. But the situation has changed completely in the past few days with the border clashes. Kabul refused to receive a Pakistan delegation led by the special envoy for a regular weekly meeting.
Curiously the latest flare-up happened when the Afghan Taliban foreign minister was on a visit to India. The relations between Kabul and New Delhi have improved greatly over the last few months at a time when India and Pakistan were locked in bitter conflict.
Although New Delhi has not recognised the Taliban administration, it has now announced to upgrade its office in Kabul to the level of a full-fledged embassy. The development signifies a remarkable shift in India’s position on the conservative Islamic movement. In the past India had described the Taliban as proxies of Pakistan.
But the dramatic changes should not come as a surprise in the current regional geopolitics where “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seems to be the guiding policy. The growing relations between New Delhi and Kabul, however, reinforce Pakistan’s concern about revival of the old nexus threatening its western border. Pakistan’s security institutions have long been accusing India of backing the TTP and other militant groups involved in terrorist activities.
There may be no denying the security threat emanating from the militant sanctuaries across the border. But it’s not the only reason for the surge in militancy in the country. One must not gloss over the failure of our own counterterrorism policies. Arguably, we have never had a long-term and coherent policy to deal with this existentialist threat. Our inconsistency in dealing with the threat has been a major cause for the current surge in militancy.
The military’s spokesman in his recent press conference in Peshawar tried to shift the blame to the then political leadership for allowing thousands of armed TTP fighters back home. But the fact is that all state institutions were on board at the time.
TTP fighters were allowed to return without any precondition, including some ‘jet black’ terrorists. It was all reportedly done on the pressure of the new Afghan Taliban administration, which was then seen as a close ally. Could it have happened without the approval of the state?
Most importantly, the political instability in the two strategically located provinces — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which are the main centres of militant violence — has given huge impetus to the outlawed groups to operate.
 
 

What the state is not willing to accept is that the rise of militancy is directly linked with political instability. Only kinetic operations cannot defeat militancy. The growing political alienation in KP and Balochistan is most alarming. There is a huge trust gap between the local population and the security forces in the troubled areas, making it much more difficult to fight militancy.
Putting the entire blame on external forces is not enough; we must put our own house in order. No country can successfully fight insurgency without public support.

Published in Dawn, October 15th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-15 03:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949021/mideast-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Mideast peace?</strong></a><br><p>AS some of the world’s most powerful leaders gathered in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, geopolitical theatre and hyperbole replaced substance, as the assembled luminaries celebrated ‘peace’ in the Middle East. Leading the pack was US President Donald Trump, as he declared, in a moment of self-congratulation, with reference to the Palestine-Israel conflict and his Gaza peace plan, that the “long and painful nightmare is finally over”.
While the genocide in Gaza has certainly stopped, achieving a just and permanent peace in occupied Palestine is still a very distant goal. Despite the effusive praise Mr Trump has received over the Gaza plan, including from Pakistan’s prime minister, who again called for giving the Nobel Prize to the US leader, and declared that he had “saved millions of lives”, there is little of substance in the Trumpian scheme.
For one, there is no clear path towards a sovereign Palestinian state, even though Egypt’s president claimed that the deal paves the way for the two-state solution. We must remember that the Oslo Accords of 1993 — which offered a much more detailed, if flawed, framework for peace — collapsed in the chaos of the Second Intifada, mainly because of Israel’s insincerity towards genuine peace.
Moreover, the idea of a foreign-administered, colonial-style administration to oversee Gaza, including the deployment of foreign troops, sounds deeply flawed. Those familiar with the region should remember the involvement of American and European ‘peacekeepers’ during the Lebanese civil war; that experiment ended in disaster. The ‘nation-building’ debacle in Iraq should also not be forgotten.
In short, neither Gaza nor the West Bank should be ruled by foreign forces. Palestinian factions of all persuasions should come together and manage their land till the conditions are created for credible elections.
It is also a fact that amidst the celebrations of ‘peace’ in Sharm el-Sheikh, there was no mention of accountability for Israel’s crimes during the Gaza genocide. Unfortunately, the Zionist state has for decades acted as if it is above the law, killing, maiming and stealing from the Palestinians since the time of the Nakba. It is because Israel was not punished for its past impunity that it felt confident enough to carry out the Gaza slaughter.
If there is to be genuine peace in the region, two things are essential. First, those in Tel Aviv responsible for the murder and starvation of tens of thousands of Gazans must be held to account. The world must pledge that ‘never again’ will there be another genocide like Gaza. Secondly, a firm roadmap towards a sovereign and viable Palestinian state must be drawn up. Anything less than this will only perpetuate the cycle of violence, as Israel continues to deny the Palestinians their legitimate rights.

PHC Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive, further instructing that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati should administer the oath if the governor did not.
The court’s decision, which was reserved earlier today, came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.
Afridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position. The two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who is also from the PTI and stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — have been returned over “disparate signatures”.
 
 

But, the PTI maintains that a chief minister’s resignation does not require the governor’s approval under the Constitution. With this contention, the party elected Afridi in a session boycotted by the opposition.
The same day, in a pre-emptive move, it approached the PHC with the request pertaining to Afridi’s oath-taking.
In its written order on the application released today, the court noted that Gandapur had “unequivocally affirmed” on the floor of the provincial assembly that he had tendered his resignation on Oct 8. “In light of the certified copy of the transcript of the speech, […] it is manifest that the office of the chief minister stood vacated with effect from” Oct 8, the order stated.
It further said that consequently, a new chief minister was elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Constitution.
Citing Article 130(5) of the Constitution, the court observed that it required a newly elected CM to be sworn in by the governor before assuming office.
“Correspondingly, it is the constitutional obligation of the worthy governor to administer the oath of office to the newly elected chief minister without delay or obstruction.
“Certainly, upon his failure to administer oath to the newly elected chief minister within a reasonable time, it would be construed that such circumstances have arisen rendering the administering of oath to the newly [elected] chief minister impracticable in terms of Article 255 of the Constitution,” the order read.
It further stated that keeping in view the assurance given by Additional Attorney General (AAG) Sanaullah, who was representing the governor, the court expected that Kundi “shall fulfil his constitutional obligations” and administer the oath to Afridi in accordance with the Constitution without further delay.
“This forum further trusts that no impediment shall be caused in the administration of oath, and that the process will be completed without any further delay.”
It added that if the governor failed to administer the oath to the CM-elect by 4pm tomorrow, in terms of the authority conferred under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, the PHC chief justice was nominating the KP Assembly speaker to administer the oath to Afridi tomorrow.
“This direction is issued to uphold the sanctity of the Constitution, to ensure continuity in governance, and to prevent the constitutional vaccuum in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the order said.
Court proceedings
The court had directed AAG Sanaullah yesterday to confirm whether the KP governor had received the summary related to Afridi’s oath-taking from the assembly secretariat and submit a reply today.
The AAG informed the court today that the governor was out of city. He said the governor had told him that his flight to Peshawar was scheduled for tomorrow. “He said he does not have a private plane […] and the provincial government could send him helicopter to arrive in the city today.”
Moreover, the advocate general requested the court to nominate a person to swear Afridi in and ensure that the oath-taking took place today.
Counsel for the PTI Salman Akram Raja and the KP governor’s lawyer, Amir Javed, also presented their arguments.
Raja contended that why did the governor want to verify Gandapur’s signatures. Accusing the opposition of intending to “create difficulties”, he argued that after a CM’s election, matters could not be delayed any further.
CJ Shah, who was presiding over the proceedings, observed that Article 255 of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of oath of office, had been amended to address issues as the one presently under consideration.
For his part, Kundi’s counsel Javed informed the court that he spoke to his client multiple times over the phone yesterday. The lawyer told the court that the governor stated that he would decide on Gandapur’s resignation if legal conditionalities were met.
The chief justice then enquired whether the opposition parties had not participated in the election. He observed that the opposition had boycotted the election at the last minute.
Javed requested the court to wait until 3pm tomorrow on the matter.
At that, the PHC CJ observed that under Article 255, a chief minister’s resignation did not require any approval.
Then, addressing Javed, he asked: “Can you guarantee that the governor will be present tomorrow and administer the oath?”
He went on to observe that the governor had raised objections over Gandapur’s signatures on his two resignation letters. “[Even though], Ali Amin Gandapur confirmed on the assembly floor that he had resigned.”
Arguing further on this, Javed cited multiple provisions from the Constitution.
He said “everything is clear” in Article 130(7), which states: “The chief minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor, but the governor shall not exercise his powers under this clause unless he is satisfied that the chief minister does not command the confidence of the majority of the members of the provincial assembly, in which case he shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence from the assembly.”
Moreover, he said the governor’s powers were also made clear in Article 48 (president to act on advice, etc.).
He assured the court that the governor would make a decision tomorrow in accordance with the Constitution.
At that, the CJ asked, “Who is running the province at the moment?”
He also enquired whether the election schedule for the CM’s post had been challenged.
Saturday and Sunday were off days for the court, which was why the schedule wasn’t challenged, Javed replied.
Eventually, the court reserved its decision on the matter and later ruled that the KP governor should administer the oath to Afridi by 4pm tomorrow.
Kundi says never refused to administer oath
Following the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.
Kundi said he was in Karachi on an official engagement, and “as governors don’t have special planes, I have requested the [Sindh] chief minister for one.”
Asked whether he would reach Peshawar tonight, he replied: “God willing, I will reach any time tonight.”
PTI hails ‘great news’
Meanwhile, PTI leaders hailed the court decision, with party Chairperson Barrister Gohar Ali terming it “great news from [the] judiciary”.
In a post on X, he expressed the hope that the transition would be completed tomorrow and the new KP government would “stay focused on public issues”.
 






Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, he said the chief minister’s election was a democratic process and the PTI’s mandate in KP should be respected with the process completed smoothly.
He said the PTI delegation met Imran for the first time since the transition in KP, adding that the PTI founder appreciated the fact that everyone showed unity throughout the process.
PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said every child in the province knew the chief minister’s election was in accordance with the law and the Constitution.
“In the current situation, we want everyone to move forward together, but if someone thinks that they will snatch our mandate from us, it would be their wishful thinking,” he said on X. “No matter how much they try, they cannot break a single worker of Imran Khan.”
 






Speaking to the media outside the PHC, he said democracy and the law had won today.
He thanked the PHC chief justice for serving “justice”, saying that if the courts would issue rulings with such “courage”, the entire nation would stand with them.
 






Plea filed in PHC against chief minister’s election
Earlier today, JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman also filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.
Rehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.
In a petition filed today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.
In his petition, he requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as the it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman questioned how an election could be held if Gandapur’s resignation had not yet been accepted. Citing Article 130(8) of the Constitution, he stressed that elections for the post can not be held unless it was vacant.
Article 130(8) states that “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the governor, resign his office”, and is the same clause that the PTI has been citing to contend that the CM’s resignation does not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
Rehman’s petition further asked the court to declare decisions taken by the assembly and the speaker with regard to the chief minister appointment as “without lawful authority, void, and of no legal effect.”
 


The petition further urged the court to “declare all consequential notifications and actions, including the impugned notification, as illegal, arbitrary, capricious, without jurisdiction and having no legal effect.”
Rehman requested the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
It concluded by requesting the PHC to suspend the election result in order to “prevent chaos and ensure preservation of the rule of law.”
Speaking to the media outside the court, Rehman reiterated the opposition’s stance over the validity of the elections.
“We said this yesterday as well that the former chief minister’s resignation has not been accepted yet, and the governor has summoned him on Oct 15.
“Until the seat becomes vacant, the election can not be held,” he said.
Responding to a question that why the opposition chose to field candidates for the CM election if it believed the election was not in line with the law, he said, “At first, we were under the impression that the resignation had been finalised, but then the governor’s letter came to light, detailing that the resignation had not yet been finalised.”
From resignation to election
Prior to the PHC’s decision today, the barely two-year-old KP Assembly seemed to be facing a constitutional crisis, which originated from events following Imran’s decision on October 8 to change the command at the helm in the province.
 
 

In line with his directive, Gandapur resigned from his role on Oct 8 while the party’s general secretary confirmed that the party had picked Afridi as his potential replacement.
The resignation letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House initially denying ever receiving it.
But, a copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff.
Subsequently, Gandapur sent another handwritten resignation to the governor, which was acknowledged by Kundi on Oct 11. He said in a post on X that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
Late at night the next day, Governor Kundi returned the two letters submitted by Gandapur over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (tomorrow) to settle the matter.
For his part, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X, stating: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further said that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
By that time, Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election yesterday. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N recieved zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.</p><small>2025-10-15 03:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1508155051e81d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949000/ajk-information-minister-pir-mazhar-saeed-resigns-from-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>AJK information minister Pir Mazhar Saeed resigns from cabinet</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: A cabinet member in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”.
Pir Mazhar Saeed, the minister for information in the Chaudhry Anwar­­ul Haq-led coalition government, also shared a copy of his handwritten resignation letter addressed to the prime minister during a press conference at the Press Information Department. He was flanked by PID directors Am­­­jad Hussain Minhas and Mirza Bashir.
The outgoing minister expressed gratitude to the media fraternity acr­oss the state for extending full cooperation during his tenure. He asserted that he had made every possible effo­­rt to discharge his duties in accordance with national priorities and public interest.
“Despite numerous challenges, I st­­rived to make the Information Dep­a­rtment active and effective,” he said. “Whether it was the Bunyan al-Marsous issue or last November’s campa­ign (by a civil society alliance), we suc­­ceeded on every front by the grace of Allah.”

Pir Mazhar Saeed cites ‘some unavoidable reasons’ for the decision

He said that during his tenure he not only worked on internal fronts but also highlighted the Kashmir issue at the international level. “I presented the case of both Gaza and Kashmir before audiences in 45 countries and also participated in the Global Samud Flotilla, where I raised my voice for the people of Gaza,” he said.
He also thanked officers and staff of PID for their cooperation throughout his tenure, adding that several important initiatives had been achieved through the teamwork. He said his decision to step down was personal and made after due consideration, but vowed to continue his efforts for the national interest and public service in future.
Mr Saeed was elected by PTI lawmakers against a special Legislative Assembly seat reserved for religious scholars. When the PTI government plunged into crisis following the disqualification of then-prime minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas in April 2023, he joined the party’s so-called forward bloc.
In May last year, he was inducted into the cabinet as minister for information after serving as chairman of the prime minister’s inspection and implementation commission.
Recently, a seven-member federal negotiating committee had signed an agreement with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee, which, among other things, pledged to reduce the size of the AJK cabinet from 36 to 20 members as part of steps to curb “elite privileges”.
Rumours are also rife that Mr Haq may be replaced by a PPP lawmaker with the support of the PML-N.
It was being speculated that Mr Saeed resigned in anticipation of a possible change in the government or a downsizing of the cabinet. Though he arrived at the press conference in a private car, there was no immediate word from the government regarding the acceptance of his resignation.
However, a senior official at the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”.

• Anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan
ISLAMABAD: The legal team of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi is likely to conclude its final arguments before the Special Court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in the Toshakhana case related to the alleged unlawful retention of a Bulgari jewellery set, after the prosecution wrapped up its arguments on Tuesday.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand resumed the hearing at Adiala jail, where Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi and defence counsel Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry were present.
Special Prosecutor Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Barrister Umair Majeed completed the prosecution’s final arguments following the recording of statements by the PTI founder and his wife under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The court adjourned the proceedings till Wednesday (today), when lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar is expected to conclude the defence’s arguments. The prosecution may then seek brief time for a rebuttal, after which the court could either reserve or announce its verdict.
Earlier, the prosecution had closed its evidence after presenting 20 witnesses, including the PTI founder’s former military secretary, whose testimony was described as “damaging”. The court later summoned Mr Khan and his wife to record their statements before the conclusion of proceedings.
The case concerns the alleged unlawful retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — reportedly gifted by the Saudi royal family. The couple allegedly acquired the set at a nominal price, causing a loss to the national exchequer.
According to the prosecution, the jewellery set, valued at around Rs80 million, was retained after paying only Rs2.9m. The former military secretary testified that Mr Khan had instructed him not to deposit the set in Toshakhana, in violation of official rules.
During his statement under Section 342, Mr Khan had denied all allegations, terming the case “fabricated, malicious, and politically engineered” to disqualify him from politics. He said the case was politically motivated and violated due process.
Mr Khan argued that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code and maintained that even as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he claimed was presented to his wife. He said the jewellery set was lawfully retained under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 after proper valuation and payment.
Rejecting allegations of undervaluation, he said neither he nor his wife had influenced any official appraiser and described prosecution witnesses — including former comptroller Syed Inamullah Shah and appraiser Sohaib Abbasi — as “unreliable and politically compromised”.
Mr Khan also challenged the jurisdiction of both NAB and the FIA, asserting that the investigation was “extra-legal” and that the FIA had acted merely as a conduit for NAB. He questioned the admissibility of evidence obtained from abroad, including from Bulgari Italy.
In her separate statement, Bushra Bibi also pleaded not guilty, denying charges of illegal retention and undervaluation of the same jewellery set. She said the gift was declared, assessed, and retained according to Toshakhana rules. She too challenged the jurisdiction of NAB and FIA and termed the proceedings “political victimisation”.
Arrest warrant
Meanwhile, the Special Anti-Terrorism Court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in the Nov 26 protest case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.
The court noted that Ms Khanum had failed to appear twice and directed the Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Wednesday. The court rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that Ms Khanum was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the protest.

The calm waters of the Indus crossed beneath the Thatta-Sujawal bridge — the last structure over the Indus river system in the deltaic region, before it meets the Arabian Sea.
A group of fishermen had just anchored their vessel near the right bank of the Indus at the Dando jetty, after a week-long fishing trip at sea. They had their catch on ice, ready for onward transport to Karachi.
“Freshwater from the river is entering the sea. I believe river flows lead to growth in fish when freshwater meets the sea for a few months,” said Mohammad Khan Katyar, who sends his fresh catch to Karachi.
The peak of the monsoon floods had passed the last big barrage on the Indus — Kotri.

For those whose livelihoods are tied to the Indus delta, the recent monsoon floods were a boon, not a bane

“Floods are blessings of God for us as they repulse intruding sea”, remarked 68-year-old Haji Ahmed Murgur, a Keti Bander resident who remembers area from its heyday, before the sea began to encroach on the ecosystem here.
Sindh’s coastal belt faces never-ending seawater intrusion, which is rendering subsoil water brackish at a rapid pace. The taluka has 31 Dehs, spread over 124,000 acres. But just over half of this area is now un­­­der water, according to the Thatta deputy commissioner.
 
 

Besides Keti Bander, Kharochan is another small city that has almost been devoured by the sea, leading to large-scale migration from the area over the last several years.
 
 

After Thatta’s bifurcation, Kharochan now falls in Sujawal district, whose incumbent DC Zahid Rind told us that out of 32 Dehs, 29 have been swallowed by the Arabian Sea.
“The three Dehs that are left are fighting for their survival,” Rind said.
Thanks to the monsoon floods, the Indus has been taking freshwater flows to its delta for over three months now. These are entering the sea through one of the active creeks — Khobar, around Keti Bander.
“It is an hour’s boat ride to Khobar creek, and then another hour or so to reach the Arabian Sea,” said Moor Mallah, a young fisherman.
“You can see Kharochan city from here,” said Moor Mallah. Standing on the jetty of Keti Bander, he pointed towards a plantation on the other side of the river. Behind those mangroves, lies Kharochan, in the shape of an island.
The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) has been involved with a study titled ‘Monitoring Sea Water Intrusion, Sea Level Rise, Coastal Erosion and Land Subsidence along Sindh and Balochistan Coast’ to monitor water quality in the coastal areas.
The study is being led by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), in collaboration with Suparco, the Pakistan Navy and PCRWR.
According to PCRWR expert Ghulam Murtaza Arain, “as far as the water quality component is concerned, we have found saline/seawater intrusion up to 135-140 km from the southern coastline towards Kotri during testing.”
He explained that the same value of intrusion was found around 45-90 km from the southwest coastline towards Kotri.
“This study revealed that seawater intrusion intensifies with depth and is more widespread below 100 meters,” he said.
Besides Khobar, Khar was another active creek, according to research on seawater intrusion covering the period 1972-2017 by Dr Altaf Siyal, the acting vice chancellor of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU).
The research indicated that the shoreline has moved landward on the Indus’ left bank (currently Sujawal) more than on its right bank (Thatta). He had divided the right and left bank sides into four shoreline zones.
The research showed that in zones I and II on the left side of the Indus, the shoreline has moved landward by approximately 1 km and 1.24, km respectively. On the Indus’s right, the sea has intruded by 0.68 km and 0.4 km in zones III and IV, respectively.
“This substantial landward movement of the shoreline in Sujawal district is due to flat land there and coastal wave energy, strong south-westerly winds energy, supplementing fast erosion of land by increasing the pace of waves,” said Prof. Siyal, whose findings showed that the rate of shoreline change was noticeably more between 1990-2017 than the 1972-1990 period in Sujawal. Thatta also reports similar changes in its shoreline.
Until October 6, the flows downstream of Kotri Barrage had dropped to 84,000 cusecs and would continue to drop as winter approaches. The situation will remain discouraging for those dependent on river flows until May and June next year.
“The NIO study proved that land subsidence is quite clear in the Indus delta. But it is not limited to the delta, and has been reported from Pasni and Makran in Balo­ch­­istan, and even in Karachi,” according to one expert associated with the study, which has been shared with the Senate’s Standing Committee on Science and Technology.
The land subsidence phenomenon was not investigated in Sindh and Balochistan, and this is the first time it is being studied, he said.
According to his observations, land subsidence was mostly being found in tail-end areas of the Indus delta, i.e., areas like upstream Kharochan, Daboo Creek, etc.
It is caused by the extraction of groundwater and hydrocarbons, and due to the movement of micro-tectonic plates, he explained, adding that when groundwater extraction is carried out on a massive scale, a vacuum is created and the area becomes prone to land subsidence, making it easily prone to erosion.
A large portion of the coastal region is subsiding, with some areas dropping by several centimetres. The most critical subsidence, he said, was observed south of Dabbo Creek, with negative vertical displacement ranging from -178 mm to -332.6 mm, the report stated. This makes such areas more vulnerable to flooding, sea level rise, and coastal hazards.

• Global growth forecast to slow to 3.2pc in 2025, 3.1pc in 2026
ISLAMABAD: Without accounting for the yet-to-be-finalised losses from the recent floods, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday estimated Pakistan’s economic growth rate at 3.6 per cent for the current fiscal year, along with higher inflation and widening current account deficit.
The Fund’s growth projection — following its recent two-week review of Pakistan’s economy — is notably higher than the 2.6pc GDP growth and 7.2pc inflation projected by the World Bank earlier this month, which were based on its own estimates of flood-related damages.
In its flagship World Economic Outlook (October 2025) report, released at the outset of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the international lender projected global economic growth to slow from 3.3pc in 2024 to 3.2pc in 2025 and 3.1pc in 2026. While this represents an improvement over the IMF’s July estimates, it remains 0.2 percentage point below the forecast made in October last year — before the recent shifts in global trade policies. “On an end-of-year basis, global growth is projected to slow down from 3.6pc in 2024 to 2.6pc in 2025,” the report stated.
The IMF projected Pakistan’s CPI-based average inflation rate to rise to 6pc this year from 4.5pc last year, and the current account balance to shift from a 0.5pc surplus last year to a 0.4pc deficit next year. However, the Fund clarified that its projections “do not yet reflect the impact of flooding in summer 2025, whose impact is still being assessed”, making the estimates tentative.
World trade volume
The WEO forecast growth of about 1.5pc for advanced economies in 2025-26, with the United States slowing to 2pc, while emerging market and developing economies are expected to moderate to just above 4pc. Global inflation is projected to decline to 4.2pc in 2025 and further to 3.7pc in 2026.
The world trade volume is forecast to grow at an average rate of 2.9pc in 2025-26, boosted by front-loading in 2025 but still slower than the 3.5pc growth rate in 2024, as persistent trade fragmentation continues to limit gains.
“Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside,” the IMF said, warning that prolonged policy uncertainty could dampen consumption and investment. It said further escalation of protectionist measures, including non-tariff barriers, could suppress investment, disrupt supply chains, and stifle productivity growth.
The report also highlighted that larger-than-expected shocks to labour supply — particularly from restrictive immigration policies — could reduce growth, especially in economies facing ageing populations and skill shortages. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial market fragilities could interact with rising borrowing costs, increasing rollover risks for sovereigns.
The IMF also noted that an abrupt repricing of tech stocks could be triggered by disappointing results in earnings and productivity gains related to artificial intelligence, potentially marking an end to the AI-driven investment boom.
 
 

The Fund advised member countries to address strains on public finances.
“With lower growth prospects, higher real interest rates, elevated debt levels, and new spending needs — such as defence and national security — the fiscal equation is becoming more challenging to solve and leaves countries vulnerable should a large external shock occur,” the IMF warned.
Reduced aid flows
It added that low-income countries were even more vulnerable due to reduced official aid flows. For a growing number of nations, the lack of job opportunities could quickly lead to rising social unrest, particularly among unemployed and disenfranchised youth. The WEO also noted mounting pressure on policy institutions such as central banks — including in Pakistan.
“Should these pressures succeed, many of the hard-won credibility gains achieved in policymaking over many decades could be lost,” it cautioned. “Trust in central banks and in their ability to deliver price stability allows inflation expectations to remain well anchored, even when the economy is hit by large shocks such as during the recent cost-of-living crisis.”
The IMF advised that policies should aim to restore confidence and predictability, stabilise trade relations, reduce uncertainty, and rebuild fiscal space credibly. Monetary policy, it said, should remain independent yet transparent, with a key objective of maintaining price stability.
Over the longer term, the Fund emphasised that economies should invest in innovation, productivity, and multilateral cooperation, empowering private enterprise and favouring broad-based policies such as education, infrastructure, and smart regulation over costly sectoral subsidies.

• European and Arab nations, Canada and US appear willing to help fund $70bn reconstruction plan, says UN
JERUSALEM: Israel will only allow half the agreed number of aid trucks into Gaza starting Wednes­day, in a setback to hopes food and supplies would be quickly ramped up to ease famine in the enclave.
COGAT, the Israeli military arm that oversees aid flows into Gaza, also notified the UN that no fuel or gas will be allowed into the enclave except for specific needs related to humanitarian infrastructure.
It blamed Hamas for the slow release of deceased prisoners’ bodies for the decision to limit aid trucks, but the group maintains that locating the bodies is difficult.
 
 

So far, Hamas has handed over four coffins of dead hostages, leaving at least 23 presumed dead and one unaccounted for still in Gaza. The group informed mediators it will begin transferring four more bodies to Israel later on Tuesday.
Tel Aviv has also delayed plans to open the southern Rafah border crossing to Egypt.
“We are still witnessing only few trucks coming in, and large crowds approaching these trucks in a way that does absolutely not conform to humanitarian standards,” ICRC spo­­kesperson Christian Cardon told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Hamas tightened its grip on Gaza’s ruined cities, launching a crackdown and executing alleged collaborators, even as President Donald Trump warned that Hamas will be disarmed, even if it means violence.
A Palestinian security source in Gaza told AFP that Hamas’s security body, a recently established unit whose name translates as “Deterrence Force”, was conducting “ongoing field operations to ensure security and stability”.
“Our message is clear: There will be no place for outlaws or those who threaten the security of citizens,” he said.
 
 

For many Palestinians rebuilding their homes and lives Tuesday amid Gaza’s rubble, the sight of Hamas patrols was reassuring.
“After the war ended and the police spread out in the streets, we started to feel safe,” said 34-year-old Abu Fadi Al-Banna, in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.
“They began organising traffic and clearing the markets, removing the street vendors who were blocking the roads. We felt protected from thugs and thieves.”
Separately, European and Arab nations, Canada and the US appear willing to contribute to the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, a UN official said on Tuesday, adding that the two-year war there had produced rubble equal to 13 times the pyramids of Giza.“We’ve heard very positive news from a number of our partners, including European partners… Canada” regarding their willingness to help, he told a press conference, adding that there were also discussions with the US.

• FIA says outfit’s financiers will be placed on stop list
• Punjab police register over 20 FIRs against TLP leadership, say Rizvi escaped during crackdown
• Mufti Muneeb, HRCP call for probe into ‘excessive force’ against protesters
LAHORE: The authorities have launched a money-laundering investigation against Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Rizvi after “huge sums” of foreign currency were allegedly recovered from his residence in Lahore during a raid by the law enforcement agencies.
The Punjab police said the raid was conducted by the provincial police, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), adding that all items, including the gold ornaments, were confiscated. The raid at the residence of the TLP chief came after the crackdown on the outfit’s march on Sunday night. Police said Mr Rizvi had escaped during the crackdown in Muridke.
A senior police official said the law enforcers were shocked to find such a large amount of foreign currency, gold, and silver at the residence, as the TLP chief did not run any business before the formation of the radical outfit.
In light of these findings, the authorities expanded the scope of their investigation to acquire details of bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, his son, and other family members to assess the total movable and immovable assets he had obtained under the TLP banner.
The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees.
In a separate statement, the FIA said it has initiated legal and financial actions against a religious group involved in anti-state protests and violent activities, adding that the accounts and assets of several important officials and workers of the religious group were being examined based on evidence.
According to the statement, “The FIA has frozen several bank accounts that were allegedly being used to fund violent protests.” Similarly, key individuals involved in fundin­g the TLP were being placed on the stop list.
TLP headquarters ‘no-go’ area
According to a police official, who shared initial findings with Dawn, the TLP purcha­sed dozens of properties in the vicinity of its headquarters — the hub of its activities — on Multan Road, making it a ‘no-go area’ for the LEAs and the general public. He said that the TLP chief had created a team of his loyal extremists and accommodated them by purchasing various houses at throwaway prices.
 
 

“Several streets connected to the TLP’s main office have become a hub of the organisation’s trusted workers/supporters,” he said, adding that a separate team of the TLP was provided an office equipped with the latest gadgets to run and handle social and regular media campaigns. He said a dedicated team of highly trained activists was made available by the TLP to respond quickly to police operations. The Punjab police officially shared the detailed inventory of recovered valuables from the TLP chief’s residence.
They included 1.92kg of gold, 898g of silver, 69 branded wristwatches, 28 gold bangles weighing 445g, 12 bracelets (490g), 24 necklaces, chains, and lockets, and 46 gold rings (355g). Similarly, the raiding team also recovered one silver crown and 32 silver rings from the house.
22 FIRs against TLP
On the other hand, the Punjab police lodged at least 22 FIRs against TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his violent supporters across the province on various serious offences. In the primary FIR, Muridke police booked over 300 suspects on serious charges, ranging from terrorism to murder.
Besides Mr Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi and many central leaders were also booked for inciting hate and instigating workers to raise anti-state slogans. The FIR said Ins­p­e­ctor Shahzad Nawaaz was allegedly kidna­p­ped and thrashed by a TLP mob, leaving him injured. It also accused Saad Rizvi of shooting the inspector in his abdomen, leaving him critically injured. The police officer later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital.
 
 

It said that the TLP mob attacked the policemen with clubs, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons containing nails and injured several, adding that the TLP supporters were armed with lethal weapons and they opened indiscriminate fire at policemen, injuring many of them.
As per the reports, the Pakpattan, Sahiwal, and Chichawatni police lodged three cases against Mr Rizvi, his supporters and workers under the anti-terrorism law and other offences. Another FIR alleged that Mr Rizvi’s speech, broadcast live via social media from Burawla Chowk, incited his followers to block roads, shut down markets, block traffic, and disrupt public order.
Separately, the Gujrat police also booked at least 120 TLP activists on terrorism char­ges. The FIR was lodged with the Reh­m­ania police on the report of SI Aftab Rasool.
Calls for probe
Meanwhile, renowned cleric Mufti Mun­eebur Rehman urged the formation of a judicial commission, led by a serving superior judge, to investigate the crackdown on the TLP to disperse the protesters.
“There is a growing demand that a judge of the high court or the SC should lead a thorough and independent investigation into this heart-wrenching and brutal incident. The aim is to identify those responsible and to recommend appropriate punishments based on the findings,” he said while reading out a joint declaration issued at the conference of clerics in Karachi. He also urged the Punjab government and administrations across the province to hand over the bodies of the deceased TLP workers to their families and to cease raids on the homes of its activists.
Mufti Muneeb also urged the TLP leaders to reconsider their strategy and refrain from resorting to violence, instead focusing on securing their rightful place through the democratic parliamentary system. The Human Rights Comm­ission of Pakistan said the it was deeply concerned by the events that had unfolded since Oct 8, culminating in violent cla­shes between security forces and the TLP, causing multiple deaths and casualties among protesters and policemen.
 
 

“We are equally concerned by the lack of transparency and credible, independent infor­mation surrounding the operation, providing which was the government’s responsibility. While state authorities have neglected to address the TLP’s consistent role in promoting hate speech and inciting mob viole­nce against individuals and groups, particularly religious minorities, this does not justify the alleged use of excessive force,” it said.
Both the Constitution as well as international law mandate that security forces, even when dispersing violent assemblies, use the minimum necessary force, it said.

“Afghan Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources on X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
It added that Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their posts.
 






In a subsequent post, PTV said: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.’’
 






PTV added that a fourth tank position at Shamsadar post was destroyed. “There are reports of the killing of an important commander of Fitna al-Khawarij in this important operation of the Pakistan Army.’’
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch gave a ‘‘comprehensive briefing’’ to resident ambassadors in Islamabad on recent developments along the Pak-Afghan border.
‘‘She underscored Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.’’
 






Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The Inter-Services Public Relations said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
Speaking on Geo News, Asif had said a day ago that there were ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.</p><small>2025-10-14 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14232100d06d3c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948914/action-similar-to-may-9-will-be-taken-againt-tlp-talal' target='_blank'><strong>Action ‘similar to May 9’ will be taken againt TLP: Talal</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday that the government has decided to take a firm stand against the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), and that action against the protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of May 9.
Speaking to Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the state minister said that since the formation of the current administration under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, TLP has attempted to march on Islamabad twice.
“In every march, the government signed agreements with them; many of the terms of were not favourable for the state,” he said.
However, he added, the state has taken a decisive stance.
“We have to move forward and learn from past mistakes. We will not be blackmailed anymore. Those who bring extremism and violence into politics, whether it’s May 9, November 26, or the TLP dharnas, will not be tolerated. Action against them will be similar to what was taken after May 9,” he said, referring to the 2023 protests following Imran Khan’s arrest.
The minister maintained that the state had exhausted all peaceful options before acting against the group.
“They say no dialogue was held, but backdoor channels were open. One of Pakistan’s major political and religious leaders was involved in those talks; they embarrassed him, too. Even when they stayed for two days, they were given a way to withdraw peacefully, and women and children who had been arrested were released.”
Rejecting claims that the protests were about Gaza or Palestine, he termed the TLP’s actual demands as “shocking”.
“They wanted money, demanded government positions for their clerics, and called for the release of their members convicted in criminal cases,” he said.
He accused the group of emotionally exploiting religious sentiments and trying to weaken the state at a time when Pakistan was “fighting on both its eastern and western borders”.
“Even when Afghanistan attacked, they did not call off their sit-in,” he said.
Responding to reports that he had received over 1,700 threats online, Chaudhry said state institutions were taking legal action.
“Cybercrime, FIA, and police are all active. Around 2,800 people have been barred from travelling,” he said, warning that fake news was again being spread in a manner similar to the November 26 events.
Talal also mentioned that a large number of TLP members had been deported from Saudi Arabia for misconduct. “They are ruining the name of both the country and religion abroad,” he said.
Law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.</p><small>2025-10-14 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/142231151c87ab8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948908/pakistan-elected-to-unhrc-for-2026-28-term-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan elected to UNHRC for 2026-28 term: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday.
The United Nations General Assembly also announced 13 other countries for the term beginning on January 1, 2026, namely: Angola, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, India, Iraq, Italy, Mauritius, Slovenia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Viet Nam.
 






“My profound gratitude to all UN Member States for their support!” FM Dar said on X. “Pakistan’s election is a recognition of its strong credentials and contributions in strengthening the global human rights framework.”
 






 






Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to work with the international community on the basis of “TRUCE”, i.e., tolerance, respect, universality, consensus-building, and engagement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed delight at the development, saying it reflected Pakistan’s effective and active role at the United Nations.
“We reaffirm Pakistan’s strong commitment to play an active role in the council for the promotion and protection of human rights across the globe,“ he added.

“The two countries have maintained high-level strategic mutual trust and close communication on major issues concerning each other’s common interests. From what I’ve learned, the two countries have been in communication on Pakistan-US mining cooperation,” said spokesperson Lin Jian.
US Strategic Metals, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation, includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
Pakistan also exports nearly $1.2 billion worth of copper ore to China annually and is expanding cooperation in the mining and mineral sectors as well with the close ally. China produces over 90 per cent of the world’s processed rare earths and rare earth magnets. The 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars. Exports of 12 of them are restricted after China’s commerce ministry added five — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — more last week, along with related materials.
Lin Jian, spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was asked about the mineral shipment to the US and its alleged link to China’s curbs.
He stated that Islamabad and Beijing have been in communication regarding the mining activities and “Pakistan stressed that its interactions with the US will never harm China’s interests or its cooperation with China”.
Furthermore, in an apparent reference to a photograph circulating on social media that showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir displaying an open case containing minerals samples to US President Donald Trump, the spokesperson said: “The samples that the Pakistani leaders showed and gave to the US leader are gem ores purchased by staff in Pakistan. The reported stories that you mentioned are either misinformed or invented, or even designed to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan. They are just baseless.”
The photograph was released by the White House, after a September meeting in the US, and showed Field Marshal Munir pointing to the contents of the case and Trump looking at them.
The spokesperson said China’s recently released export control measures on related rare earth items “have nothing to do with Pakistan”.
“It is a legitimate action by the Chinese government to refine its export control system in accordance with laws and regulations. It aims to better defend world peace and regional stability and to fulfill non-proliferation and other international obligations,” he added.
He reiterated that China and Pakistan were “all-weather strategic cooperative partners” whose iron-clad friendship “has stood the test of time’’.
Last week, China expanded its export controls over rare earths and related technology in a move to further tighten its grip and dominance on the critical minerals key to the energy transition.
Five more medium to heavy rare earth elements — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — and related material will be added from November 8, China’s commerce ministry said.
The rare earths will join over twenty elements and related materials already listed, in each case forcing exporters to apply to Beijing for licences before selling overseas. China has also separately banned exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States.</p><small>2025-10-14 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/142043210aace2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948902/bangladesh-garment-factory-fire-kills-16-toll-may-rise-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh garment factory fire kills 16, toll may rise, official says</strong></a><br><p>A fire at a garment factory in Bangladesh and a chemical warehouse adjacent to it on Tuesday killed at least 16 people and injured several, with the death toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continued, an official said.
“Sixteen bodies have been recovered from the second and third floors of the garment factory,” fire service director Tajul Islam Chowdhury said, adding that the number of deaths could rise as recovery operations were continuing.
He said the cause of the blaze wasn’t immediately known.
The fire broke out at around midday on the third floor of the seven-storey factory in the Mirpur area of the capital Dhaka, before spreading to a chemical warehouse storing bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, Talha Bin Jashim, another fire department official said, citing witnesses.
Grief-stricken relatives gathered in search of their loved ones, some clutching photographs.

History of industrial disasters
Chowdhury said the factory owners had not yet been identified. “The police and the army are looking for them.”
Asked whether the chemical warehouse had a license to operate, he said: “We don’t know about the license yet. However, as far as we have heard, it is illegal. We will be able to confirm once the investigation is completed.”
In a condolence message, Bangladesh’s interim government head Muhammad Yunus expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy. He directed authorities to investigate the cause of the fire and to ensure that victims and their families receive all necessary assistance.
Poor fire and building safety standards lead to dozens of such disasters in Bangladesh each year, and past accidents have tarnished the country’s textiles sector, which employs 4 million people and makes up more than 10 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.
In 2013, more than 1,100 people were killed when the multi-story Rana Plaza building housing garment factories suddenly collapsed.
On Tuesday, 12 firefighting units brought the blaze at the factory under control after nearly three hours, though the fire at the warehouse continued.
Members of the Bangladesh Army, police and border guard joined the rescue operation, officials said.

On Sunday, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
It said clashes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, after Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“In the past, I played a role in reducing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can do it now, too,” Fazl told reporters in Islamabad.
The JUI-F chief, the only Pakistani political leader who has met the Taliban supreme leader, Shaikh Hibatullah, has an influence on the Afghan Taliban.
“I have been in contact with the Afghan leadership, and they want to resolve the issues through understanding,” the JUI-F chief said.
Fazl said that with a ceasefire now in place between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both sides should refrain from blaming each other for the recent hostilities.
“Both countries should try to cool things down instead of provoking each other, including on social media,” he added.
Talking about Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to India, the JUI-F chief insisted that instead of “making a fuss over Muttaqi’s statement on Kashmir being part of India, “we should also look at our own role in Kashmir.”
“How many policies has Pakistan changed on Kashmir? Does Pakistan want a solution to Kashmir in accordance with the spirit of UN resolutions, and what progress has it made on this?“ Maulana asked.
He said Afghanistan’s intelligence and other military capabilities were still in their initial phase. On Sunday, Afghan Taliban Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had said that Pakistani strikes on Kabul “will have consequences” and that the country had “weapons to respond.”
“Pakistan has a world-class army and capability. Our state should think whether opening a western front is somehow the right war strategy at this time,” the JUI chief maintained.
The increased activity of armed groups within Pakistan since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 has remained a common source of tensions between the two neighbours. Pakistan maintains that armed groups, particularly the TTP, operate from within Afghan soil, a claim that Afghan officials have denied, maintaining that no one can use Afghan soil against any country.
Last year in October, the Taliban government had extended assurances to Pakistan that it would not allow terrorist groups to use its soil against Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-14 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141756252109c67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948850/first-pakistan-south-africa-test-finely-poised-after-spinners-run-riot' target='_blank'><strong>First Pakistan-South Africa Test finely poised after spinners run riot</strong></a><br><p>The first Test between Pakistan and South Africa was set for a thrilling conclusion after rival spinners Noman Ali and Senuran Muthusamy wrought destruction on day three in Lahore on Tuesday.
Muthusamy took a maiden 10-wicket match haul to help bowl Pakistan out for 167 in their second innings on another day dominated by spin to give South Africa a target of 277 for victory.
But Noman, following up his 6-112 in the first innings, dismissed captain Aiden Markram for three and Wiaan Mulder (nought) to keep the visitors down to 51-2 at the close.
 






Ryan Rickelton, 29 not out, and Tony de Zorzi, unbeaten on 16, fought till stumps with South Africa needing another 226 runs.
Pakistan need eight wickets for a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.
With the threatening spin duo of Noman and Sajid Khan the home team will fancy their chances, especially because no visiting team in Pakistan has ever chased more than the 220-8 Sri Lanka did in Rawalpindi in 2000.
Pakistan head coach Azhar Ali was in buoyant mood.
“We will definitely defend this target,” said the former Pakistan all-rounder.
“The state of the pitch and our spinners make us favourites, despite our batting not up to the mark in the second outing.”
De Zorzi, who hit a century in South Africa’s first innings, acknowledged the pressure was on.
“These are tough conditions for batting, but hopefully myself and Rickelton can build tomorrow,” he said.
“We will definitely give our best tomorrow, knowing that partnerships will be like gold.”
As a gripping match approaches its climax, Muthusamy destroyed Pakistan with figures of 5-57 to add to his 6-117 while fellow spinner Simon Harmer took 4-51 as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 17 runs.
The hosts were fairly well placed at 150-4 but Saud Shakeel holed out for 38 off Muthusamy to trigger a collapse in the last over before tea.
Harmer bowled Mohammad Rizwan for 14 before Muthusamy ran riot.
He dismissed Salman Agha for four, Noman Ali for 11 and Shaheen Shah Afridi for nought to finish with match figures of 11-174, taking four wickets off 21 balls.
Harmer ended Pakistan’s sloppy batting display by removing Sajid Khan for one.
Earlier, South Africa were dismissed for 269 an hour before lunch, conceding a lead of 109 after Pakistan’s first-innings 378.
Noman took 6-112 for his ninth haul of five wickets or more in Tests.
With the Gaddafi Stadium taking big turn, South Africa tossed Harmer the new ball in Pakistan’s second innings.
The 36-year-old had Imam-ul-Haq stumped by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne for nought before trapping captain Shan Masood lbw for seven.
Muthusamy then had Abdullah Shafique for 41 and pacer Kagiso Rabada trapped Babar Azam leg-before for 42.
Azam has now failed to score a hundred in 28 Test innings dating back to December 2022.
Earlier, South Africa’s De Zorzi resumed on 81 at the start of the day and carried the fight to Pakistan, completing his second Test century with a six and two singles off Noman.
The left-hander finally holed out for 104 to long-on off Noman, where Shaheen Shah Afridi took a low catch, ending a 208-minute innings containing 10 fours and two sixes.
Noman, who bowled a probing 35 overs, also removed Prenelan Subrayen for four during the session.
Fellow spinner Sajid took the first wicket of the day when he had Muthusamy caught by Salman Agha for 11.
He then wrapped up the innings when he bowled Rabada for nought to finish with 3-98 off 33 overs.</p><small>2025-10-14 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14185541867b05c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948889/looking-to-perform-better-with-bat-says-aroob-ahead-of-england-world-cup-encounter' target='_blank'><strong>Looking to perform better with bat, says Aroob ahead of England World Cup encounter</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s all-rounder Syed Aroob Shah said on Tuesday that the team was looking to “perform better with the bat” ahead of the pivotal encounter with England in the ICC Women’s World Cup.
Last week‘s defeat against Australia left their knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot.
A superb century from Beth Mooney dragged defending champions Australia back from the brink of disaster after being 76-7 before they completed a crushing 107-run win over the Green Shirts.
“We’re working hard in the nets, and our main focus is for our batters to fight as much as possible on the ground.
“It’s very important for us to post a big total — around 200+ — because that will increase our chances of winning. We’re working on this, and hopefully, in the next match, you’ll see us perform better,” the spin all-rounder said.
She was answering a question about Pakistan’s batting struggles amidst high-scoring encounters in the rest of the tournament.
The Green Shirts are yet to cross the 200-run mark after being bundled out for paltry scores in all three matches so far.
Speaking about the advantage of playing at the same venue for all the matches, Aroob said it was down to them playing good cricket to make use of the familiarity.
“Yes, we do have the advantage of playing at the same venue for all matches, but obviously, the other teams are also coming well-prepared. So, that point isn’t very valid anymore — that we’re getting an advantage,” the 21-year-old leggie said.
She added that when the side plays good cricket, only then will we get the benefit of the venue, adding, “We’re working on that and will try to play well in the next match.”
“Yes, the tournament is still open, and we have full hope. It happens that some teams lose their first few matches and then come back strongly,” Aroob added on an optimistic note.
“So, we believe we can do the same. We’ll take each match as it comes, play well, and try to win all four remaining games to stay in the tournament,” she said.
Fatima Sana’s charges endured a tough start to their campaign, slumping to heavy defeats against Bangladesh and India.
Their batting has wavered, although their bowling has been exceptional in short phases but has lacked the punch to finish innings well, and lapses in the field — a combination that has left them bottom of the eight-team table with little margin for error.
Pakistan need their batting to fire going into the England encounter if they are to avoid an early exit from the marquee event.
Opener Muneeba Ali is one of the batters who need to come good — having come into the tournament in decent nick but unable to provide the Green Shirts with good starts at the top of the order.
England go into the encounter with three wins in three matches — adding to the peril of the Green Shirts’ task.
Speaking ahead of the match, England’s Alice Capsey said that Pakistan had been involved in some “exciting games of cricket”.
“I think what we’ve seen by Pakistan so far is that they’ve been involved in some really exciting games of cricket, and they’ve had teams kind of on the back burner a little bit,” the 21-year-old batter said.
She added that England were making sure that they were really specific with what their plans were for each individual bowler — whether that be seam or spin.</p><small>2025-10-14 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14182219d702401.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948893/iran-says-us-presidents-invitation-to-dialogue-is-contradictory' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says US president’s invitation to dialogue is contradictory</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s foreign ministry on Tuesday criticised US President Donald Trump’s call for dialogue, accusing Washington of “hostile and criminal behaviour” after his remarks to Israel’s parliament about being ready to strike a deal with Tehran.
The ministry said in a statement that Trump’s call for peace is in conflict with his actions towards Iran.
“Mr Trump can either be a President of Peace or a President of War, but he cannot be both at the same time,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a separate comment on X on Tuesday.
 






In June, the US joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities after five rounds of indirect nuclear talks with Tehran that stalled over issues like domestic nuclear enrichment.
The foreign minister reiterated his position that Tehran has always been open to “respectful and mutually beneficial diplomatic engagement”.
US demands that Tehran stop enriching uranium were rejected earlier this year as “excessive and outrageous” by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said Tehran’s issue with Washington was currently “unsolvable” as the other side wants “Iran to be obedient to America.”
Western countries accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, but Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes.</p><small>2025-10-14 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14162817272ff29.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948876/big-win-for-rano-shc-directs-karachi-zoo-to-move-distressed-brown-bear-to-sanctuary-within-2-days' target='_blank'><strong>‘Big win for Rano’: SHC directs Karachi Zoo to move distressed brown bear to sanctuary within 2 days</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday ordered the Karachi Zoo administration to move the female brown bear Rano to a sanctuary within 48 hours, amid uproar over her worsening condition.
On October 7, a two-judge SHC bench directed the senior zoo director and Sindh Council for Conservation of Wildlife (SCCW) secretary to appear in court today along with a report about the health of the brown bear.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC and submitted that he approached the court in the public interest to seek a declaration of recognition of animal cruelty to the female brown bear, currently confined at Karachi Zoo, in violation of relevant law.
A two-member bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and including Justice Syed Fiazul Hassan Shah, resumed hearing the petition today.
Justice Kalhoro expressed his anger at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
“How could the bear be kept in such conditions,” he asked, in reference to Rano’s condition, and ordered the handing over of the bear to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that the “bear had been kept in one place for seven years.”
The counsel further argued that Rano was in “extreme distress, as a result of which she often hits her head on the cage, causing injury.”
“Rano has developed worms in her wound,” the counsel added.
 
 

Earlier this month, it had emerged that Rano had suffered a head injury, and the wound was infested with maggots due to a lack of care.
Addressing the respondents, Justice Kalhoro questioned, “What was the fault of this speechless animal that she has been kept in the same place for seven years?”
Criticising the conduct of the respondents, the judge further said, “Why do you need to wait for a court order to do your work?
“Why was the bear not transferred to a better place, and why was she not treated at the zoo?”
Responding to the judge’s comments, the SCCW secretary blamed KMC, saying “SSCW has no authority over the Karachi Zoo as it is under the management of KMC.”
Activist Jibran Nasir appeared as the counsel for Pereira, while Advocate Hasnain Abidi attended as the lawyer for KMC. The hearing was adjourned till October 17 (Friday).
In a post on X, Nasir said: “KMC extended the argument that if the bear is shifted, it will impact the entertainment avenues for citizens of Karachi. On this, the Honourable Bench remarked that ‘KMC must realise we live in the 21st century and we should act civilised and with empathy’.
“Animals are not a source of entertainment. Animals belong in national parks or jungles and forests. Cruelty to animals is also forbidden in Islam,” Nasir quoted the bench as saying.
 






‘Big win for Rano’
Speaking to Dawn.com, petitioner Pereira termed the decision a “big win for Rano.”.
“Today is a big win. But not for me. It’s a big win for Rano,” he said, expressing the hope that Rano would not be subjected to noise pollution, exploitation, and disease anymore.
“She will learn to smell grass, play, get genuine love and an environment best suitable for her well-being,” Pereira said.
 
 

“We owe her that. It’s the least we could do.”
He continued, “I am not here to get involved in politics. I don’t have a fight against government institutions. I’m only here to ensure captive wildlife get a chance at freedom…because freedom cannot be selective. It’s their right.”
Rano ‘under stress’ in barren cage
Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
 
 

While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.
Earlier this month — nearly eight months after the committee’s recommendations — it emerged that KMC still had no plans to implement any of the recommendations made by its own committee, as per sources.</p><small>2025-10-14 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1411560473a1160.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948849/shares-at-psx-rebound-as-kse-100-index-climbs-by-7000-points' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX rebound as KSE-100 index climbs by 7,000 points</strong></a><br><p>A day after experiencing a significant downturn, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index rebounded by 7,000 points on Tuesday, recouping the previous day’s losses.
Bearish sentiment had taken hold of the market on Monday, with the 100-Index plummeting 4,600 points, wiping out Rs534 billion from market capitalisation, amid rising tensions with Afghanistan, political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and violent protests in Punjab. The market had closed at 158,443 points, lower by 4,654 points, or 2.85 per cent.
Today, the KSE-100 index surged 7,032.6 points, or 4.44pc, to close at 165,476.02 points.
Of 483 active scrips, 391 advanced , 69 declined while 23 remained unchanged.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market had rebounded today as “tensions with Afghanistan and domestic unrest following the breakup of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protests had eased overnight”.
“After entering a corrective phase following the trade data released on October 2, participants are now focused on next week’s current account print and progress toward a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” he said.
Stating that 12,334 new investor accounts were opened in the month of September, Farooq suggested that retail investors take a “long-term approach, build positions gradually, and consider exchange-traded funds or mutual funds if inexperienced”.
“While valuations are reasonable, potential slippage on the current account and fiscal side could pose near-term headwinds, and a repeat of the last two years’ returns over the next two years appears unlikely,” he added.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market had “rebounded after correction”.
He also said the “easing of geopolitical conditions” had supported the market.
Intense border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse yesterday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Separately, a crackdown against protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in multiple cities and political uncertainty in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had added more pressure.</p><small>2025-10-14 11:23</small></div><hr>
