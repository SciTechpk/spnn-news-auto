Nepra’s state of industry reports for 2024 and 2025 show that electricity sales from the grid fell for two straight years. They dropped three per cent in 2023-24 and another 2.8pc in 2024-25, even while the economy grew. This is the paradox we now face: even as economic activity increases, the amount of power drawn from the national grid is falling.
This shrinking grid marks a historic reversal. For decades, Pakistan’s energy story was one of rising demand and crippling shortages. The policy response was a wave of large thermal IPPs. At the time the IPPs under CPEC were planned nobody could foresee a 90pc collapse in solar panel prices — from two dollars to 20 cents per watt. That black swan event triggered one of the world’s most spectacular solar booms, rendering the legacy thermal fleet of power plants a costly albatross. It’s nobody’s fault. It was a timing mismatch. But we are living with the consequences.
How we got here is the first half of the story. Now to get out of this hole we need to reimagine a grid for the future. The old system was built for the last century. It assumed power would always flow one way, from large central plants to passive consumers, and that demand would keep rising. That world is gone. In the new system most of the generation is decentralised, vast amounts of power can be stored and exchanged at the local level and the grid is democratised — a true network for electrons. The footprint of electric vehicles will grow larger, with every 3kWh of EV charging displacing one litre of gasoline.
Yet, our regulatory framework stubbornly clings to the past. Nepra’s recent Prosumer Regulations of 2025 explicitly prohibit selling power to anyone but the utility, banning peer-to-peer energy exchange and blocking ‘wheeling’ — the essential mechanism that allows generators to sell power directly to any chosen consumer across the grid, using the utility’s lines as a common carrier for a fee. This is a deliberate and regressive policy to protect the revenue of a dying system. It attempts to suppress the very innovation — local storage, smart exchanges, microgrids — that could solve the crisis of unaffordable energy. We are trying to force a 21st-century technological revolution into a 20th-century regulatory box, and the economy is paying the price.

Our regulatory framework stubbornly clings to the past.

The question now is how to manage the transition so that the old system does not drag the economy down while the new one takes its place. And so if we imagine our economic objective to be to provide Rs20 per unit electricity to everyone then the sensible way forward is to retire the remaining high-cost legacy plants through negotiated settlements. Two exercises need to be done: 1) Prepare a phased retirement schedule for the legacy IPPs. 2) On a blank whiteboard sketch out the reimagined grid Pakistan needs for this century.

 

Here is a hypothesis I have not seen tested: what if high power costs are silently shaving 2pc off Pakistan’s GDP each year, through lost output, weak aggregate demand and eroded competitiveness? Consider the corollary. If average tariffs fell to Rs20 per unit, could annual growth rise from 3pc to 5pc?
Run a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation. Assume early IPP retirement costs Rs500 billion. Pakistan’s GDP is roughly Rs110 trillion. An extra 2pc growth yields Rs2.2tr in additional output annually. Of that, roughly 9pc flows to the government as tax revenue, about Rs200bn per year.
That is a two-and-a-half-year payback on the buyout cost. The numbers are indicative; the direction is not. The question is not whether we can afford to retire the old system. It is whether we can afford not to.
In finance there is a clear rule: the investment decision and the financing decision are separate. First decide whether the move makes economic sense. Only then worry about how to pay for it.
Such terminations have been done elsewhere. Some years ago Malaysia retired a significant portion of its aging IPP fleet through negotiated buyouts, lowering tariffs and accelerating its renewable transition. Germany tackled its stranded coal assets through a structured phase-out with compensation and freeing the grid for renewables. These weren’t painless exercises, but they recognised a fundamental truth: clinging to legacy infrastructure for fear of near-term costs can inflict far greater long-term damage.
I have not yet seen a white paper that sets out this trade-off clearly. Yet the choice is simple. We can let the old system linger and bleed the economy, or we can manage its orderly exit and unshackle the economy for higher growth. It is time to take the decision on economic logic alone.

Published in Dawn, February 14th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-14 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698fd819d2d63.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973146/hierarchy-of-failure' target='_blank'><strong>Hierarchy of failure</strong></a><br><p>WITH the 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences being awarded to Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt “for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction”, the idea that only a constant process of innovation and disruption can inject dynamism in an economy, a new mantra has gripped Pakistan’s policy elite and commentariat. This follows the official pressing of the panic button on the economy by none other than the incumbent prime minister, in a brutal violation of the narrative spun by the Ministry of Finance.
An elite panel was constituted, and furthering earlier work, it concluded in essence that “creative destruction” will be the silver bullet that will save the economy from its current nosedive. To achieve this will require reform of the import tariff regime, which will ultimately force inefficient firms to either ‘swim or sink’.
The elegant prescription applied to Pakistan, unfortunately, stems from a complete misdiagnosis — and a dangerous one at that. It is yet another example of transplanting ideas without a country-specific context or a nuanced understanding of initial conditions.
At the core of the elite policy recommendations is the implicit assumption that the inefficiency and lack of competitiveness in the economy are all endogenous to firms — that is, internal to the way firms choose to operate, inherent in their business decisions, and independent of external factors. The assumption is that firms have agency over their environment, or that the environment in which they operate is neutral and does not exert any negative influence.
This is obviously a heroic assumption in the case of Pakistan. And completely off the mark. Formal sector firms in the country operate under the following dizzying set of constraints: the most expensive electricity in the region (with frequent interruptions); the highest tax burden (up to 50 per cent plus with the super tax); an over-valued exchange rate; widespread smuggling and under-invoicing that produces a $68 billion supposedly underground (but very much above-ground) parallel economy that undercuts the formal economy; executive overreach and regulatory burden; cost of corruption and bribes; non-availability of a skilled workforce; training costs for an unskilled and semi-skilled labour force, the product of chronic under-investment by the state; paying for water, security, extortion by local criminal gangs, forced hiring of political appointees, and dealing with frequent policy reversals. This set of constraints is not even exhaustive.

The country’s policy elite has discovered the Holy Grail. Too bad they are holding the wrong end.

The net effect is that, according to calculations by the Pakistan Business Forum, the cost of doing business is 34pc more expensive in Pakistan than in regional peers. As a consequence, formal sector firms, including supposedly ‘protected’ ones operating behind high tariff barriers, have been exiting in droves and Pakistan is experiencing a silent economic scarring (or hysteresis), with the real possibility of permanent de-industrialisation.
Many of the missing essential elements are public goods on paper. The complete absence of basic building blocks of a thriving business environment — policy stability, law and order, a healthy and productive labour force, affordable and available electricity, gas and water, protection from executive overreach, including from predatory taxation, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment and risk of appropriation, predictable contract enforcement, copyright protection, recourse to independent courts — is entirely ignored in the policy recommendations. None of the above inefficiencies are endogenous to firms. And each of these is a necessary condition for a successfully functioning market economy.

 

Virtually all the constraints facing businesses represent a catastrophic system failure, of environment design, not of individual firms. While firm productivity in Pakistan is low by any measure, and does need to improve ultimately through less protection and more competition, the proximate cause of the abysmally low overall national competitiveness is the myriad negative externalities produced by a malfunctioning and extractive political system. Exhibit A in this regard is the political corruption in IPP contracts that has led to the power crisis.
Imposing the costs of failure of the state onto firms is a bad idea and will not bring about the desired results. A simple thought experiment should make this clear. If we assume the process of creative destruction runs its course, and many ‘inefficient’ firms are forced to exit, which new firms will replace them under the existing constraints listed earlier? Is it realistic to imagine new investment from the private sector under conditions of the highest regional electricity tariffs or predatory taxation or policy inconsistency? Instead, we will most likely end up attracting shadowy crypto firms and chasing government-to-government deals with sovereign guaranteed rates of return, while the rest of the industrial base dissolves into non-existence.
An economic system is perforce a product of the political system. The political system is higher in the hierarchy than all the other sub-systems; hence, any malfunction there affects all the constituent sub-systems. The degenerating economic order cannot be viewed in isolation from the political economy. It is a function of the political order, kept in place to support the extraction and rent-seeking. The two go hand in hand. As I have argued previously, for this reason, the economy cannot be fixed without fixing the politics first — and the sequencing is important. Politics first, economy to follow. Any entity, be it an elite institution or an elite panel of experts, talking about “deep” economic reform while ignoring or implicitly ruling out reforming the corrupt and misgoverning political order is fooling itself and us. The bottom line is that economic reform requires political reform.
Genuine fresh investment that brings about innovation and efficiency, and improves the country’s overall competitiveness, will remain a pipe dream until the extractive, rent-seeking political order that shapes and produces the underlying current economic order is cast aside.
Stefan Kanfer writing in Time magazine in the 1980s had a famous paraphrase of a Kafka autobiographical thought: “there is only one illness, and medicine hunts it blindly like a beast through unending forests.” In Kafka’s case, the malady was life itself. In our case, it is our political order and system of mis-governance. Pakistan desperately needs creative destruction — but not just the kind being advocated.

Published in Dawn, February 14th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-14 04:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973151/delayed-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Delayed treatment</strong></a><br><p>IT is unfortunate that the Supreme Court was forced to intervene to order authorities to form a medical team for examining and treating an 85pc loss of vision in the right eye of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. That the apex court felt compelled to appoint lawyer Salman Safdar as amicus curiae to personally visit the PTI leader in jail to assess his health condition speaks volumes about the government’s failure to adequately respond to his persistent complaints about his deteriorating eyesight, reportedly due to a blood clot, since October and to ensure timely treatment.
For over three months, the only treatment administered to him consisted of eye drops, which yielded no improvement. Requests for access to his personal physicians were not entertained. Regular blood tests were reportedly not conducted. It is therefore hardly surprising that a condition which might have been managed or even reversed with timely medical intervention has now led to a sudden and near-complete loss of vision in one eye.

 

The provision of specialised medical care to Mr Khan is no longer a question of his demanding “privileged” treatment. It is about fulfilling the state’s legal obligations; it is a health and rights issue. Even the incumbent attorney general has acknowledged medical care to a prisoner is the state’s responsibility. The loss of sight in one eye is not a minor issue. It can be life-altering. Delayed diagnosis and treatment in such cases can result in irreversible damage.
The fact that the affected individual happens to be a former PM and the head of a major political party adds another dimension in terms of national significance. Pakistan’s history offers numerous precedents where politicians such as Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, among others, were hospitalised while incarcerated and, in some cases, allowed to travel abroad for treatment both on humanitarian and medical grounds, even when similar facilities were available locally. Fairness demands that the same standards apply for Mr Khan: he must not be denied any required medical facility. Not just that, he should be permitted to consult with doctors of his choice.
Political polarisation must not be allowed to obscure the principle that even an ordinary prisoner is entitled to timely and adequate healthcare. But when the detainee is a major political leader, any official neglect only deepens mistrust in the government and fuels political instability.

While the capital enjoys plenty of sunny afternoons, night temperatures frequently drop to between 1°C and 4°C. On rare occasions, a strong cold wave will even leave a delicate dusting of snow atop the Margalla Hills, drawing crowds to catch a glimpse of white-capped peaks.
Over the years, however, winter in the capital has become progressively shorter and warmer due to a combination of global warming and human-induced factors. Weather data from the Pakistan Meteorological Department between 1981 and 2025 shows a noteworthy shift in Islamabad’s climate profile.

According to an analysis of mean maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures during December and January, the warming trend is specifically asymmetric. While the overall climate is warming, minimum (nighttime) temperatures are increasing at a much faster rate than maximum (daytime) temperatures.

Danish Baig, the head of Meteorology at WeatherWalay — an Islamabad-based private weather company — described this pattern as widely recognised in climate science as “a strong indicator of anthropogenic climate change”. “[Such a weather pattern] suggests a transition towards a more thermally moderated winter climate regime,” he said. Dawn obtained the dataset from the Met department and shared it with Baig for analysis.

Baig’s assessment has been supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 6th report (AR6), in which the leading scientific body noted that the “frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain). This also applies at the regional scale, with more than 80 per cent of AR6 reference regions showing similar changes.”
Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes, the IPCC confirmed.
It may be noted that the global temperature in the post-industrial age has risen more than the 1°C to 1.5°C threshold agreed under the Paris Agreement has been breached twice – in 2024 and 2025.
According to Baig, the changes in winter temperature reflect the impact of climate change in Pakistan. “The pronounced rise in winter minimum temperatures relative to daytime maxima reflects enhanced longwave radiation trapping during nighttime hours and is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations, elevated aerosol loading, and changes in winter cloud cover,” he said after analysing the dataset.
“This asymmetric warming is a well-documented characteristic of climate change across South Asia and is particularly evident in urban and peri-urban environments,” he said. The expert added that warmer night-time temperatures “reduce the occurrence of radiative cooling, leading to fewer frost events and persistently warmer winter nights”.
He said a similar warming pattern was visible in Lahore and Peshawar as well. Meanwhile, a report prepared by the Karachi Urban Lab, which reviewed a 60-year dataset, reached a similar conclusion for Karachi.
Pakistan Met Department Chief Meteorologist Dr Muhammad Afzaal told Dawn that local factors, particularly deforestation, were also responsible for this “observed rise” in temperatures.
“Climate change drives broader warming trends, with Pakistan’s mean annual temperature rising over a recent decade, prolonging heatwaves and elevating both daily highs and lows,” he said.
Another factor making the city hotter is the urban heat island effect, he said, adding that rapid expansion since the 1990s has “significantly enhanced Islamabad’s urban heat island effect”.
“Increased built-up surfaces, reduced vegetation cover, and continuous anthropogenic heat emissions have particularly amplified night-time warming during winter,” Dr Afzaal said.
“Locally, rapid urbanisation replaces green spaces with concrete, intensifying the urban heat island effect; tree cover has dropped as housing expands, trapping heat and preventing nighttime cooling. Deforestation exacerbates this, reducing shade and carbon sequestration,” he added.
Islamabad’s residents are experiencing firsthand how the winter season is changing around them.
Nasir Jamil, a schoolteacher from Gokina village in the Margalla Hills, told Dawn that the capital city used be colder in the 1980s. He said that some peaks in the Margalla would regularly receive snow in the winter, but he has not seen these snowcapped peaks for a long time.
“There were hardly any vehicles or roads, and the city’s air was pristine, but now, deforestation and infrastructure expansion, particularly in the Margalla Hills area, have taken their toll,” said Jamil.
Climate policy expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh agreed that winters were getting warmer, saying this was evident even through “observational science”.
“The changes in weather patterns did not occur abruptly, but rather took decades, and the solutions would also need to be tailored, keeping long-term planning and sustainability in mind,” he said.
Sheikh suggested that Islamabad’s urban planning should include more indigenous solutions, such as ‘doongi grounds’ for groundwater recharge. Urban landscaping, he noted, must prioritise plants that are resilient to rising temperatures, have broad leaves to absorb carbon and support local fauna, ensuring that urban plantations can withstand increasing heat.

He added that expanding tree canopies across the city as green ringtones can help reduce the urban heat impact, while minimising asphalt surfaces can decrease water runoff and heat absorption.
Some solutions that can be deployed to adapt to a changing climate include reducing built-up areas where possible, increasing porous surfaces to support groundwater recharge, implementing rainwater harvesting, and designing better storm drains to manage urban flooding, he said.
“One thing is certain: the current developmental model cannot keep pace with changing weather patterns, and policymaking must adapt to reflect the realities of climate change and its effects on urban environments,” Sheikh said.
For adaptation, planting trees is not the answer. It requires local solutions, such as shelters for the poor and vulnerable, Dr Nausheen H Anwar, who heads the Karachi Urban Lab, said.
According to Dr Anwar, the fundamental problem is that extreme climate impacts, including cold and hot, will not cease without risk mitigation, while risk mitigation requires a global-scale intervention to reduce fossil fuel consumption.
Scientists and policy experts have suggested that to protect the public from heat, the government should have a proactive approach in the form of early warning systems, introduce more green spaces, and use innovative techniques, such as coal coatings, to reduce heat absorption. “Adaptation and risk mitigation go hand in hand,” Dr Anwar, however, noted.
Besides making cities hotter, the rising temperatures have broader “environmental and socioeconomic” ramifications.
“It changes winter energy demand patterns, increases winter smog potential, reduces the frequency of frost events, and alters agriculture chilling requirements” across northern Pakistan, according to Baig. “Winter temperature trends in Islamabad, when examined alongside Lahore and Peshawar, reveal a structurally consistent warming pattern across northern Pakistan.”
The impact on agriculture is also confirmed by the IPCC scientists, who warned that fluctuating rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, an effect of global warming, were expected to reduce yields of staple crops in the region.
In an email to Dawn, Dr Mukesh Gupta, science officer of IPCC Working Group II, said that the increased frequency of extreme weather events, like floods, directly threatens crop production and disrupts food supply chains. He proposed crop diversification and climate-resilient seeds, among other measures, to address this looming food crisis.
“Adaptation strategies, including the development and use of climate-resilient seeds, can mitigate some impacts, but financial and technological barriers limit their adoption in low-income countries like Pakistan,” he said, adding that equitable resource use and enhanced access to technology are essential to deal with this problem.

Washington Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded at approximately 3:33am on Wednesday to a report of smoke in a hallway in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue NW. Firefighters entered an apartment, extinguished a small fire, and found an adult male unconscious and not breathing.
The victim was later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as 40-year-old Syed Hammad Hussain. Officials said he showed signs of blunt-force trauma as well as thermal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene after responders found no signs consistent with life.
The apartment is located near Logan Circle, a busy residential area about 1.1 miles northwest of the White House.
In an official statement issued on Friday, police said that following an initial assessment, the matter was referred to police and taken over by homicide detectives. As of Friday, no suspects had been identified.
Investigators are reviewing security camera footage from a neighbouring building. Sources familiar with the investigation told local media the footage shows Hussain entering the building with three other individuals, including a possible woman, shortly before the fire. The same individuals were later seen running from the building.
Authorities have appealed to the public for information and urged anyone with knowledge of the incident to contact police. The Metropolitan Police Department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
The Hussain family is from Lahore and is settled in Washington.

ISLAMABAD: Sitting on mammoth liabilities of Rs9.2 trillion — equivalent to half of Pakistan’s annual budget — and facing ever-rising losses and negative equity, the power sector leadership remains clueless about its business operations as a going concern and the consequential challenge to the state.
This damning charge sheet has been issued by the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance in its FY25 aggregate report on the performance of State-Owned Entities, as required by the IMF, posing a serious question mark on the credibility of power sector planning.
This is despite the fact that the power sector remains the top recipient of equity injections, while continuously bleeding the economy and consumers at large. National Highway Authority (NHA) comes as the second biggest financial black hole after the power sector.
Worst still, the business plans submitted by power sector distribution companies (Discos) tend to be descriptive rather than analytical. These plans often list intended activities, such as improving recoveries or reducing losses, but fail to model the financial impact of these interventions.
“The absence of clear financial causality undermines the credibility and effectiveness of these plans,” the CMU observed in its report released on Friday with the approval of the federal government as required under the IMF programme.
The report noted over Rs2tr of unfunded liabilities of all federal SOEs, including more than Rs1.5tr of unfunded pension liabilities in the power sector alone, in addition to around Rs1.9tr circular debt, despite around Rs800bn capital injection during FY2025.
Not only the Discos but generation companies (Gencos) typically present outdated and defensive business plans, focused on preserving existing capacity rather than optimising the asset portfolio. There is a notable lack of cost-benefit analysis of refurbishment versus decommissioning, as well as little evaluation of asset-disposal or privatisation options. Consequently, capital remains tied up in low-yield assets.
A recurring theme in Gencos plans is the sunk cost fallacy — the notion that prior investments justify continued capital expenditure. However, in a reform-oriented context, sunk costs should be viewed as historical facts, not as valid grounds for further investment. “Without rationalisation modelling, capital continues to be misallocated”, the report observed.
The report said the Discos’ plans frequently omit essential financial planning elements, such as capital prioritisation, sequencing investments aimed at loss reduction, and modelling of returns on investment. There is little consideration of indicators such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), or leverage.
“As a result, these plans lack the rigor needed to serve as tangible restructuring roadmaps and instead remain mere wish lists”, the report said pointing out “a broader challenge of Discos following an activity-based planning approach — plan, spend, and hope for positive outcomes — rather than a value-based approach that emphasises modelling, prioritisation, and strategic allocation based on return on investment”.
Overall, the CMU reported that fiscal support to SOEs increased by 37pc to Rs2.079tr in FY25, compared with the previous year’s Rs1.513tr. The expansion of fiscal support was driven by significant changes across various components, including equity injections totalling Rs729bn, led by a one-off circular debt payment.
Government loans to SOEs also grew, climbing by 34pc from Rs263.3bn to Rs354.1bn, underscoring the government’s ongoing commitment to providing direct financial resources to support SOE operations and restructuring.
In contrast to increases in guarantees, loans, and equity, both grants and subsidies declined. Grants fell by 27pc to Rs269.2bn, while subsidies dropped by 7pc, reaching Rs726.3bn. These reductions “reflect shifting government priorities or improved operational efficiencies in certain areas”.

 

Sovereign guarantees increased markedly, from Rs1.412tr in FY24 to Rs2.164tr in FY25, reflecting a 52pc rise. This change is not due to the addition of new guarantees, but rather accounting for self-liquidating guarantees on stock.
During FY25, SOEs experienced a decline in their overall profitability. Aggregate profits decreased by 13pc, falling from Rs820.7bn in FY24 to Rs709.9bn in FY25. This downward adjustment was primarily attributed to reduced financial contributions from profit-making SOEs in the oil sector, a consequence of declining international oil prices.
On the loss side, there was a slight improvement, with cumulative losses across SOEs declining by 2pc to Rs833bn in FY25 against Rs851.4bn in the previous fiscal year. “The net result of these changes in profits and losses was a total net adjusted loss of Rs122.9bn for FY25 from Rs30.6bn in FY24”, it said, putting the NHA at the top with Rs295bn loss and over Rs315bn power sector loss.
Total SOEs equity increased by 7pc, rising from Rs5.865tr in FY24 to Rs6.246tr in FY25, but this growth was primarily driven by recapitalisation efforts and significant equity injections, particularly in the power sector, to clear the circular debt stock.
On the liabilities side, there was a moderate improvement, as total liabilities decreased by 3pc to Rs31.742tr in FY25 from Rs32.57tr. Total assets value remained largely unchanged, exhibiting only a marginal decrease of 1pc to Rs37.988tr from Rs38,44tr a year earlier.
During the year, the federal government collected Rs12.97tr in tax revenue, of which approximately Rs2.1tr (about 16pc) was channelled back to SOEs through subsidies, equity injections, grants, and loans. In practical terms, every Rs6 collected in taxes results in Re1 being absorbed by SOEs.
The SOEs’ debt stock, circular debt, pensions and quasi-fiscal flows showed that total debt portfolio rose by 4pc, increasing from Rs9.196tr to Rs9.571tr, reflecting a clear re-profiling of the funding architecture among SOEs. Cash Development Loans saw a significant expansion, up 21pc to Rs2146tr. Similarly, Foreign Re-Lent exposure increased by 24pc to Rs2.16tr.
“These changes confirm a shift toward sovereign-intermediate financing, in which the federal government assumes the credit risk and SOEs act as pass-through borrowers”, the report deplored. Bank borrowing remained nearly unchanged at Rs2.8tr, suggesting a credit-saturated environment and sector-wide tightening of exposure limits.
Contributing factors include elevated leverage, a deterioration in debt service coverage, and higher expected losses. Unfunded pensions stand at Rs2.03tr, including Rs1.5tr in the power sector, and excluding the pensions of Pakistan Railways, which reports pensions on a cash basis annually rather than on aggregate pension unfunded obligations.
Statutory compliance standards were found to be weak and uneven across SOEs, with approximately 36pc of SOEs having finalised audited financial statements as of the reporting cutoff. This constrains the timeliness of performance analysis, valuation assessments, and comprehensive fiscal-risk evaluation.
The CMU called for continued strengthening in these areas — including board composition, audit timeliness, disclosure quality, and performance-linked accountability — which would support greater strategic discipline and help SOEs progress toward sustained value creation for the state.

• DP World CEO Bin Sulayem ousted as investors stop funding over ties to disgraced financier• Goldman Sachs lawyer Ruemmler resigns due to her extensive ties to Epstein in documents• PM urges probe into top Norwegians’ links to dead felon
DUBAI: The chairman and chief executive of DP World Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem’s resigned on Friday following pressure over his alleged ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, making him one of the highest-profile figures to step down after the recent release of documents.
The fallout also prompted the resignation of a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and has sparked official inquiries into political and royal figures in Norway.
Bin Sulayem’s departure from the Dubai-based logistics giant was announced the same day the emirate’s ruler appointed a new chairman for the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, another role Bin Sulayem held.
Pressure mounted on the state-owned firm after two major investors, the UK development finance agency British International Investment and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, said this week they would suspend new investments with DP World over the matter.
Both organisations welcomed the resignation. The UK agency said it looked forward to continuing “our partnership to advance the development of key African trading ports”. In a statement, La Caisse said “the company took the appropriate measures” and it would “move quickly to work with DP World’s new leadership”.
DP World appointed Essa Kazim as the new chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, the Dubai Media Office reported. Kazim is the governor of the Dubai International Financial Centre, while Narayan was the company’s deputy CEO.
The documents, released by the US Department of Justice, revealed frequent correspondence between Bin Sulayem and Epstein for more than a decade after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
The correspondence allegedly includes business discussions, plans for Bin Sulayem to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island, and exchanges of an intimate nature. While being named is not evidence of wrongdoing, the contents prompted immediate scrutiny.


Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem

US Rep. Thomas Massie, who reviewed unredacted files, referenced the resignation in a post on X on Friday.
“DOJ red­acted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”







Bin Sulayem was a key architect of Dubai’s transformation, having established the developer behind the emirate’s palm-shaped islands and helping build DP World into one of the world’s largest port operators.
Top lawyer resigns
The repercussions also rea­ched Wall Street, where Gold­man Sachs’ general counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, anno­unced she will resign at the end of June.
The decision followed the release of emails showing her extensive relationship with Epstein long after his conviction.
The interactions reportedly included career advice, questioning of his sex crimes, and personal messages where Ruemmler called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey.”
Before joining Goldman Sachs in 2020, Ruemmler held senior roles at the Department of Justice and served as a legal advisor in the White House under then-President Barack Obama.
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he accepted her decision.
‘Shocking connection’
Meanwhile, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Friday it was crucial to fully investigate the relationships between prominent Norwegians and Epstein.
“I think it has been quite shocking for people to get this insight into this world and the connection between people with power. And how it has affected people without power, who have been abused and subjected to assault,” Stoere told public broadcaster NRK. “As prime minister, I have a responsibility to speak clearly about this.”

These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023.
UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters.
According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025.
The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country. UNHCR’s recent survey of returnees highlights the scale of challenges they face. Just over half reported being able to find some form of work, even if informal. For women, this figure drops to less than a quarter. More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day.

More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day

“We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said. While 5 per cent of returnees surveyed say they intend to leave Afghanistan again, more than 10 per cent know a relative or community member who has already left since returning. These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life.
“This year, our focus is on supporting the reintegration of returnees. We have the access, presence and experience of the last four decades in Afghanistan to deliver the assistance that communities say they most need, including protection services, housing and livelihood support, particularly for women.”
Along with other UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is closely monitoring the regional situation, where asylum space continues to shrink and regulated migration pathways are narrowing. Afghans increasingly feel compelled to undertake dangerous onward journeys.
“We remain prepared to respond to population movements into Afghanistan, while also continuing to call on states to uphold access to asylum, protect and assist Afghan refugees, and ensure that no one is returned to a place where their rights and freedoms are at risk,” the UN refugee agency said.
Given the dire humanitarian situation and rapidly increasing population, additional support is urgently needed in 2026 to scale up assistance and invest in reintegration, enabling people to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope and stability.

AMMAN: More than a week after he walked away from Human Rights Watch over its blocking of a report on Palestinians’ right of return, the organisation’s former country director says he is still fuming over the lack of a transparent explanation.
Omar Shakir, ex-HRW Israel and Palestine director, resigned in February after the executive director withdrew a report on Palestinian return rights before its December release.
“The report finds that Israeli authorities’ longstanding policy denying Palestinian refugees the right of return, a fundamental right well-established in law, has caused serious harm and amounts to a crime against humanity,” Shakir told AFP in Amman.
Shakir, who resigned alongside his research colleague Milena Ansari, said the organisation has not provided a written reason for pulling the report. When the story became public, Shakir said, HRW stated the report had been “paused to give them more time to conduct additional factual and legal analysis”.
Meanwhile, HRW told AFP the report’s release was delayed due to its complexity. Their review revealed the need for stronger research to meet standards, leading to a pause for further analysis, which is ongoing.
Shakir believes the decision was due to political backlash, as HRW’s new leadership worried the report might be perceived as a call to eliminate Israel’s Jewish identity.
“So, ultimately, this was not about the law or the facts,” he said. “This was a decision motivated by concerns of how the organisation would be received when issuing this report.
The “right of return” is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dating back to the 1948 war. Approximately 760,000 Palestinians were displaced in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, with descendants now numbering six million according to the UN. Israel sees this demand as a threat to its Jewish identity.
Smear campaign
Meanwhile, a UN human rights spokesperson on Friday expressed concern about attacks on independent UN experts after several European governments criticised Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for Palestine, and called for her resignation.
“We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing.
The Czech Republic’s Foreign Minister Petr Macinka on Friday quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a “common enemy of humanity”, and he also called for her resignation.
Subsequently, Germany, France, and Italy criticised Albanese this week for remarks against Israel, accusations she refutes.
Albanese’s February 7 remarks in Doha did not label Israel as such although she has regularly criticised its actions in the Gaza conflict, Reuters confirmed.
Albanese said on X: “Three European governments accuse me — based on statements I never made — with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days.” She was citing figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000.







Though unprecedented, it’s theoretically possible to introduce a motion to dismiss a special rapporteur, however, diplomats said strong support for Palestinian rights within the UN Human Rights Council means such a motion is unlikely to pass.

In a statement, GB Police said the CTD had begun work with 250 officers and personnel, while recruitment for another 600 posts would be completed during the current year to strengthen the unit’s capacity.
The statement said assistance would be sought from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for basic training and professional skills development of CTD personnel in GB.
SSP Tanveerul Hassan has been appointed head of CTD Gilgit-Baltistan. All counterterrorism-rela­ted FIRs registered so far have been transferred to the CTD police station in Gilgit.
Mr Hassan said the CTD had four wings, including investigation, intelligence and operations, and would handle terrorism-related cases across the region.
He said the case relating to Thursday’s attack on a Frontier Works Organi­sation (FWO) vehicle in the Tangir valley of Diamer had been registered with the CTD.
The federal government had approved the establishment of a CTD unit in Gilgit-Baltistan in September last year, authorising the creation of 613 new posts to combat terrorism and violent incidents, particularly along the strategic Karakoram Highway (KKH).
However, federal and regional officials were facing funding challenges, with recurring expenditure for the new posts placed on the resource-strapped Gilgit-Baltistan governm­ent and uplift funds for construction deferred until the next fiscal year.
A Central Development Working Party (CDWP) meeting on July 25, 2025, reviewed the GB government-sponsored project, titled “Raising of CTD police in GB”, estimated to cost over Rs1.5 billion. The initiative followed a directive by the prime minister to establish the CTD in GB within six months.
According to official documents, the project aims to enhance the capacity of GB Police by addressing “critical gaps in human and technical resources” to enable effective responses to terrorist incidents and comprehensive investigations. The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions is to sponsor the project.
The Ministry of Planning had cited “reduced fiscal space in PSDP” and a “substantial” existing financial commitment to GB as reasons for delays.

Talking to a select group of media persons in the federal capital, he said that Iran was countering the “Zionist and Western narrative” alongside military aggression, adding that the US and Israel had a history of “deception and backstabbing”.
“But they have seen the response in the recent 12-day conflict, and Israel was almost on its knees when the US intervened,” the envoy said. He added that wars were not fought merely with weapons but with national determination and the resilience of the whole society.
He said that the West had used all its cards in the June 2025 attack by the Zionist regime and the recent conspiracy when riots were held, and acknowledged that the resistance movements in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria had been weakened.

Moghadam urges Muslim unity, lauds Islamabad’s support for Tehran during 12-day war with Israel

“While there are ups and downs in wars and broader conflicts, the US, Israel and others have seen the advanced military capabilities as well as the strength of the Iranian nation — it is less likely there will be a war soon,” Mr Moghadam said.
‘War may affect region’
“If, God forbid, war breaks out, regional countries will have to make their own decisions, as such a war would affect the entire region,” he added.
He stressed that Iran had always called for greater unity and cooperation among Muslim countries since the Islamic revolution.
He said that all the Muslim nations were targets on their list but the priority was different. “Today it is Iran and tomorrow it will be Saudi Arabia,” he added.
Referring to the “12-day war” with Israel last year, he lauded Pakistan for supporting Iran and said that despite strong propaganda and huge networks, the Western narrative had weakened over the decades and resistance to the policies of Zionism was visible globally.
He also lauded Pakistan’s stance at regional and international forums, claiming Islamabad had supported Iran diplomatically during the recent conflict. “There is a clear understanding in Pakistan that any harm to Iran is harm to Pakistan,” he added.
The ambassador said that US President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan for Gaza was a mockery, as all the funding for the restructuring of the Palestinian territory would be in the hands of the American president, “who has no credibility”.
“Whereas the establishment of the [international stabilisation]force [for Gaza] was a dangerous move as its target was to disarm the resistance group Hamas through Muslim countries,” he added. “Pak­istan’s decision to distance itself from this force is encouraging.”
Balochistan
Speaking on common issues, he expressed concern over terrorism in Balochistan province and said that it was a bilateral matter between the two countries.
He observed that there was a need to look into the root causes of the problems faced by Pakistan’s Balochistan province and Iran’s adjoining Sistan province. He said that militant activities could not be countered through the use of force alone.
“Lack of opportunities and discontent among the people of Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan provinces has to be addressed through economic development and cooperation to neutralise the hostile designs of the common enemies of both countries,” he added.
Women empowerment
Responding to a question on the status of women in Iran, the envoy said that while Iran had laws regarding the hijab, there was no coercion in public spaces, and women continued to play a prominent role in education and professional sectors.
He said that recent rallies on the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the revolution held across Iran witnessed participation by both veiled and unveiled women.
“There is a law regarding the hijab in our country, and that is enforced in government offices, but there is no strictness in public gatherings,” he said, adding that similar social variations were visible in other Muslim societies, including Pakistan.
He clarified that certain dress codes applied within government institutions, as was the case in many countries, but only Iran was targeted by the Western media.
“Western media never showed the progress made in this regard, as women’s participation in Iran’s higher education is huge. There are more female students in Iranian universities than male students, and women are scientists and hold senior posts even in highly technical projects,” he said.
“But nobody compares the representation of women across professions in Iran with other Islamic countries, or with what it was before the Islamic revolution,” Mr Moghadam added.
“Nobody among us would like to see the status of women as commercial products or be named in those notorious file[s of late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein],” the envoy maintained, and concluded that the status of women should be seen in the context of Iran’s social laws and societal norms.

The sit-in started after Friday prayers and was ongoing till midnight.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Subsequently, the TTAP announced the sit-in outside the Parliament House on Friday (today).
The protesters were still present at the Parliament House late at night on Friday, having shifted from outside to the main hallway of the premises.







In a video shared by the opposition alliance on X, TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said they planned to spend the night at the Parliament House.
On a lighter note, he added, “In the morning, we will sit [here] again after changing clothes and shaving. And if the [protest] is prolonged, the entire Ramazan will be spent staging sit-ins.”







Earlier, the opposition alliance vowed that the sit-in would “continue until Imran is admitted to Al-Shifa Hospital“.
“No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health,” the TTAP said.







Ahead of the sit-in, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that PTI lawmakers reached the parliament “after overcoming all the obstacles in their way”.
Qaiser said that he, along with Achakzai, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shahram Khan Tarakai, and Shandana Gulzar, reached the assembly. He added that the “group discussed the present situation and deliberated on the future course of action”.







He later shared a video of the sit-in outside Parliament House, saying that they were demanding the provision of medical facilities for Imran in the presence of his family and personal physician.
“Providing the best medical facilities is Imran Khan’s legal and constitutional right. No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health. If our demands are not met, we will announce our next course of action,” he said.







TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, had earlier claimed that the government “has cordoned off all roads leading to Parliament” ahead of the sit-in.
Khokhar had also claimed that “gates of parliamentary lodges have been shut, trapping MNAs and Senators inside.”
He stressed that the measures were being taken to “stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan.”
“This doesn’t reflect strength, rather weakness,” he added.







Protest outside KP House
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was also in Islamabad, but his Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi alleged in a post on X in the evening that “Islamabad police forcibly stopped” the CM and other members of the provincial assembly from reaching the Parliament House.
Consequently, they staged a sit-in outside the KP House in the federal capital, he said.
It was also alleged in the post that police personnel “pushed and roughed up” the protesters.







The PTI also alleged in a post on X that Special Assistant to the KP CM on Information Shafi Jan “had his collar grabbed by a police officer.”







Jan later appeared on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, where he said a large contingent of police and prison vans reached the KP House as they were leaving for Parliament.
He said he and others with him were stopped by police at a barrier near the KP House. The law enforcement personnel later “grabbed my collar and … threw me into a prison van, due to which [I suffered a minor] head injury”, Jan alleged.
He said this behaviour of the “federal police and government was unfortunate”.
The sit-in at the KP House was also under way after midnight.
PTI asks SC to issue written orders; seeks probe into ‘use of force’ against parliamentarians
Meanwhile, the PTI alleged in a statement that its parliamentarians had been “forcibly barred” from participating in the protest at Parliament and subjected to torture.
“There have been reports of misbehaviour towards women and them being roughed up,” the party alleged.
The party also decried the delay in the fulfilment of its demand that the Supreme Court (SC) issue written orders regarding Imran’s examination.







“We demand that … Imran Khan be provided access to his personal and specialist physician without any delay, that he should be allowed to meet his family immediately and that he be immediately shifted to the hospital for the treatment of his eye,” the PTI said in its statement on X.
The party further demanded an investigation into the “use of force against parliamentarians” and legal action against those responsible.
Earlier, PTI, in a post on X, addressed the CJP, demanding “formal written directions” for the PTI founder’s health examination.
“CJP, we require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” the party said.
It called on the CJP to “issue and release the written orders,” stressing that Imran needed “urgent eye treatment.”
“This is not politics, this is not about power. This is about Imran Khan’s life,” PTI added.







Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, in a post on X, also said that the family had not yet received a written order from the SC regarding the PTI founder’s eye inspection.
“It is 3:40pm on Friday, February 13, nearly 30 hours after the jail visit report was presented before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Yet, no orders have been issued for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad for examination and treatment by specialist doctors under the supervision of his personal medical team,” Aleema said.







In an earlier post, she said that despite the court’s deadline of February 16, the “directive cannot be implemented without a written order from the court.”
“Given the urgency and the risk to his eyesight, why has the CJP delayed issuing the written orders?” she added.







Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry spoke to the media ahead of the sit-in outside Parliament. He was asked about the blockade during the media talk, at which he maintained that the opposition had a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.”
He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”.
“There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added.
Chaudhry, during his media talk, gave assurance that the PTI founder would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”.
Addressing the media outside Parliament, Chaudhry said: “Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.”
“If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added.
He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.”
He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”.
Addressing the claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.”
“The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said.
He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”.
He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC.
He added that a new medical report will be issued soon.
The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”.
Awaam Pakistan to join TTAP’s sit-in
Separately, the leadership of Awaam Pakistan — Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail — announced that it will participate in TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament House.
“The peaceful protest is being staged in response to the alleged deprivation of vision in Imran Khan’s one eye, and the government’s refusal to allow access to his personal doctors and family.”







The TTAP further said the decision was made last night in a meeting also attended by Awaam Pakistan’s leadership.
“Denying any prisoner timely and appropriate medical care is immoral, inhumane and illegal,” the opposition alliance said, adding that Imran Khan was Pakistan’s former prime minister and the leader of the “country’s largest political party”.
“The Awaam Pakistan party will join TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament immediately after Friday prayers today.”
“We firmly believe in the rule of law, the people’s constitutional rights, free and fair elections, and true democracy, and we will always stand with the people in their struggle for these principles,” the post said.
Dr Zafar Mirza, central spokesperson of Awaam Pakistan party, in a social media post on X, said, “Imran Khan’s eyesight is at risk without urgent medical treatment! Awaam Pakistan is part of the peaceful protest of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and will stay until he receives the medical care he legally deserves.”







Later, Ismail shared on X that Mirza had “rushed to Lahore to attend the Namaz-i-Janaza of our party’s founder and Punjab Convenor Syed Zaeem Hussain Qadri sahib. But, he will attend the dharna tomorrow morning”.

The Gerald R. Ford carrier, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, US President Donald Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The Gerald R. Ford will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere”.
Trump had said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if a deal is not reached with Iran.
On Friday, he told reporters he thought that talks with Iran would be successful but warned that “if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran”.
Long deployment
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also includes sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</p><small>2026-02-13 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/132306366857346.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972947/un-security-council-condemns-suicide-attack-on-imambargah-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council condemns suicide attack on imambargah in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: The 15-member United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Friday condemned the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad in the “strongest terms”.
On February 6, a suicide bomber had ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident and more than 150 were injured.
In a press statement issued by UNSC President James Kariuki, the 15-member body described the February 6 attack as a “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing terrorist attack”.
The UNSC expressed “its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan” and wished “a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured”.
Reaffirming its long-standing position, the UNSC said that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”.
The statement further stated that UNSC members stressed the need to ensure accountability, underlining “the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
They urged all states to cooperate actively with Pakistan “in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions”.
Last week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also strongly condemned the attack.
“The secretary general reiterates that attacks against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” his spokesperson said, stressing that those responsible “must be identified and brought to justice”.</p><small>2026-02-13 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/131832225a9527c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972932/12-killed-6-injured-in-traffic-accident-on-m9-motorway-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>12 killed, 6 injured in traffic accident on M9 Motorway in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Twelve people were killed and six others were injured in a traffic accident involving an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 Motorway at Ansari Bridge near DHA City, according to officials.
Police and Rescue 1122 had initially stated that 13 people were killed and nine were injured. Later, however, Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed confirmed to Dawn that 12 people had been killed and six were injured.
After the accident, a significant quantity of oil spread on the M9 Motorway, causing difficulties for rescue workers who avoided using electrical equipment for fear of fire. As a result, they had to manually cut apart the vehicles to retrieve the bodies of the injured.
It is worth mentioning that authorities gave different reasons for the traffic accident. While Malir police attributed it to the bus travelling in the wrong direction, motorway police said that the tyre of the oil tanker had burst.
Malir Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Abdul Khaliq Pirzada told Dawn that 13 people had died in the accident and nine others were injured. He said that the initial investigation showed that the oil tanker was on its way to Karachi, while the passenger bus was Sanghar-bound.
He said that the bus was coming from the wrong direction, which led to the accident. He said that as a result, the oil tanker overturned and fell onto the van.
The police official said that the rescue operation had been completed; however, combustible material was being removed from the oil tanker.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that four vehicles were involved in the fatal accident: an oil tanker, a passenger bus, a passenger van and a trailer carrying goods. He also corroborated the SSP’s statement regarding the passenger bus travelling in the wrong direction.
However, Motorway police, in a statement, said the accident was caused by the oil tanker’s tyre bursting. The statement also confirmed the four vehicles were involved in the accident.
In this connection, Communication Minister Abdul Aleem Khan took notice of the accident and directed the Motorways inspector general to conduct an immediate investigation and submit a detailed report.
In a statement, he said that the tyre quality of every vehicle — large or small — entering the motorway must be strictly inspected. He categorically instructed that vehicles equipped with expired or substandard tyres must not be allowed onto the motorway under any circumstances.
Sindh CM orders inquiry
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed regret over the lives lost in the incident and ordered an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the accident.
In a statement, he vowed that action would be taken against those responsible. He also directed the strict implementation of traffic laws for the protection of citizens.
In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar expressed deep sorrow and grief over the accident. Lanjar directed authorities to ensure immediate and the best possible medical treatment for the injured.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep sorrow and grief over the accident, according to a statement by the President’s Secretariat.
“The president prayed for the forgiveness of those who lost their lives in the incident and extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” it said.
It further added that President Zardari also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed the Sindh government to ensure the provision of immediate and best possible medical treatment to those wounded in the accident.</p><small>2026-02-13 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/132210478c2c4c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972944/journalist-in-lahore-released-after-being-detained-for-questioning-by-nccia' target='_blank'><strong>Journalist in Lahore released after being detained for questioning by NCCIA</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The National Cyber Crime Agency (NCCI) on Friday released a journalist a few hours after detaining him for questioning.
As per initial reports, Khurram Iqbal, a producer with Hum News, was reportedly picked up by unidentified men from his sister’s home in Lahore around 1pm. Subsequently, there was an uproar on social media, with many demanding information on the journalist’s whereabouts.
The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) had called on federal and provincial authorities, including the interior and information ministries, to take urgent action for Iqbal’s safe release.
The Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors had also condemned the journalist’s alleged abduction and called for his release.
The statement said that, according to Iqbal’s family, armed men in plainclothes whisked him away from his sister’s residence. It also expressed concern over the “growing trend” of harassment of journalists.
Meanwhile, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director General Usman Anwar and Lahore Operations Deputy Inspector General Faisal Kamran had denied any action against the journalist in question when contacted.
Similarly, officials from the provincial government had also not issued any public statement regarding the matter.
However, it later emerged that Iqbal was in the custody of the NCCIA, which released him around 9pm.
Requesting anonymity, a senior official of the NCCIA confirmed to Dawn that Iqbal was with the agency for questioning.
However, he did not give any information regarding the charges the journalist was facing or why he was questioned.</p><small>2026-02-13 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/130739398d2b555.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s BNP wins sweeping election majority, promises stability</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming two-thirds majority on Friday in general elections, a result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in 2024.
Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said.

The opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.
The Election Commission put the BNP at 181 seats, the Jamaat-i-Islami at 61 and others at 7, with full official results not expected before noon (11am PKT) on Friday.
The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.
“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.
A clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.
“A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,” Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told Reuters.
BNP leader Tarique Rahman is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party’s founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, he returned in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.



In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.
“If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, thats what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,” Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told Reuters after the results.

BNP supporters celebrate overnight
The Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was “not satisfied” with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.
Now in exile in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
The BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina’s Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.
But elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.
Overnight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party’s landslide became clear.
Turnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with media nearly 60pc of registered voters participated in the election on Thursday.

More than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Broadcaster Jamuna TV said more than 2 million voters chose “Yes”, while more than 850,000 said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.
The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.
President, PM felicitate BNP on election win
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.
According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.







Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.
President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.
He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.
The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”







The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.
In a later post, he said he held a phone call with Rahman following the BNP’s “historic and resounding victory in the general elections”.
“Pakistan looks forward to strengthening its brotherly ties with Bangladesh, building on the legacy of Begum Khaleda Zia, and advancing our  shared goals of peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.
“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.







India’s Modi congratulates Bangladesh’s BNP
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the BNP led by Tarique Rahman on Friday on its “decisive victory” in elections.
“This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” Modi said in a statement posted on social media, referring to Rahman.







“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh.”

“The two leaders also exchanged views on other matters of mutual interest and agreed to remain in close contact,” the statement said.
In a post on the social media platform X, PM Shehbaz said, “Had a most warm and cordial telephone conversation with my dear brother His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.”
He said the two reaffirmed the shared resolve to further strengthen the historic, fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE and to expand mutually beneficial cooperation.

The Indonesian president made his interest known during a meeting with Pakistan’s chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, who called on the former during an official visit to Indonesia, a statement by ISPR said.
“During the meeting, the air chief underscored the shared values and longstanding brotherhood between Pakistan and Indonesia, and President Prabowo expressed keen interest in leveraging PAF’s state-of-the-art training ecosystem and aerospace development infrastructure to enhance Indonesia’s defence capabilities,” the statement read.
Earlier, the statement said, the air chief held separate high-level meetings with Indonesian Defence Minister Lieutenant General (Retd) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, the commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces and the Indonesian Air Marshal.
He was accorded a guard of honour at all venues, the statement added.
“During discussion with the Indonesian air chief, both sides discussed enhanced air force-to-air force cooperation, joint training from basic to advanced levels, professional exchanges, and collaboration in emerging aerospace domains,” the ISPR statement said.
It further stated that the Indonesian air chief sought the PAF’s support in advancing operational and flying training, acknowledging its rich combat experience.
The highest award of the Indonesian Air Force, the Medal of Honour, was conferred upon ACM Sidhu in recognition of his role in strengthening bilateral air power cooperation, the statement added.
ISPR said ACM Sidhu also held a joint meeting with the Indonesian defence minister and chief of defence forces, during which a wide range of defence and security matters were discussed.
“The Indonesian leadership appreciated the PAF’s professionalism, modernisation drive, and lauded the advanced technological infrastructure of the National Aerospace Science & Technology Park,” the ISPR statement concluded.
The Indonesian defence minister, who was leading a delegation, also met ACM Sidhu when he visited Pakistan in January.
During that meeting at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the air chief briefed the delegation on the PAF’s modernisation drive, including infrastructure development, revamped training and the induction of niche capabilities to enhance readiness for multi-domain operations.
For his part, the Indonesian defence minister praised the PAF’s professionalism, combat readiness and indigenisation achievements under the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park, expressing strong interest in expanding cooperation in training, aviation and aerospace domains.
Separately, the defence minister had also met Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
“The meeting focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” a statement by ISPR said at the time.</p><small>2026-02-13 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13205823f03291a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941/t20-world-cup-india-and-pakistan-fans-flock-to-colombo-windfall-for-tourism' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: India and Pakistan fans flock to Colombo, windfall for tourism</strong></a><br><p>Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan on Sunday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.
The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan reversed a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.

 

The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.
“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.
Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.

 

It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told Reuters that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.
“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.
Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”
Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.</p><small>2026-02-13 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1320481756dfb2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972940/k-electric-appoints-adeeb-ahmad-interim-chief-executive-officer' target='_blank'><strong>K-Electric appoints Adeeb Ahmad interim chief executive officer</strong></a><br><p>K-Electric (KE) on Friday appointed Adeeb Ahmad as the company’s interim chief executive officer (CEO) with immediate effect.
Last week, Moonis Alvi had stepped down as the company’s CEO, days after getting a clean chit from the Sindh governor in a workplace harassment case.
According to a press release issued on Friday, the KE board of directors held a meeting and decided that Ahmad would be appointed the CEO in place of Alvi with immediate effect.
Further, a disclosure submitted by the company to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) also stated the same.
“The board has commenced an accelerated search for a permanent CEO,” the disclosure said.
According to KE’s website, Ahmad’s career spans 34 years, including C-suite roles. He has been involved in managing private equity funds, mergers and acquisitions, and transformation focused on energy and other infrastructure sectors. He recently served as the CEO of Hascol Petroleum Limited.
In a post on X last week, Alvi had confirmed that he had “decided to step down”.
“It has been an honour to serve an institution so central to Karachi’s life, alongside some of the most resilient and committed professionals I know,” said the former KE CEO, adding that he will “support a smooth transition”.

The development came a day after Barrister Salman Safdar submitted a report in the Supreme Court, which stated that the former premier had only 15 per cent vision in his right eye due to a delay in imparting treatment.
The resolution, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was moved by PTI Senator Aon Abbas Buppi. It demanded that the ex-premier be moved to a “premier, high‑standard hospital for comprehensive medical examination and treatment”.
It also demanded that Imran’s personal physicians and private medical team be granted immediate and regular access to evaluate his health and oversee his clinical care.
It also sought to ensure Imran’s family had consistent access to him and was kept fully informed of his medical status and treatment progress.
However, the resolution was rejected through a voice vote. The opposition demanded a vote count but that request was also rejected by the presiding officer, Shahadat Awan.
Subsequently, opposition lawmakers gathered in front of the chairman’s podium in protest and chanted slogans against the government for what they called the inhumane treatment of a high-profile prisoner.
During the session, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed that the PTI founding chairman complained for the first time about an eye issue in the first week of January, contrary to the claim of PTI that their founder had been complaining about this for the past four months.
He emphasised that medical treatment was provided promptly, without any delay. He further noted that the treatment administered was properly documented. Sanaullah advised PTI not to do politics on the health of its founding chairman.
“Jail doctors examine the PTI founding chairman every second day as part of routine medical care,” he asserted. He said separate medical boards had reviewed his health condition 25 times.
Sanaullah said there was no reference to his eye ailment in the medical board held on December 9, 2025.
He further said that the counsels met the PTI founding chairman on December 20 on the occasion of the Toshakhana-II Case verdict and at that time, he did not refer to the eye ailment. He pointed out that PTI lawyer Safdar was also present on the occasion.
“If the PTI has any suggestions regarding the medical care of its founding chairman, it should approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” the PML-N leader said, assuring that any directions issued by the apex court would be fully implemented.
Sanaullah said the report submitted to the Supreme Court clearly established that the PTI founding chairman himself was satisfied with the living conditions in the prison.
Senate opposition leader, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, noted that the PTI founder’s health issue should be viewed on humanitarian grounds.
“Let’s go together and meet him. We will go see him and report back to the Senate. Let people meet him, things will normalise,” he remarked.
Abbas called for burying dirty politics and said new traditions should be set. He insisted that criminal negligence had been committed while treating Imran.
He asserted that the doctor who examined the PTI founder was not a retina specialist.
However, PTI Senator Ali Zafar, who is also the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said, “Enough is enough.”
He said that at first, illegal and false cases were instituted against Imran, lamenting that the situation had now escalated beyond legal proceedings to deliberately endangering the PTI founder’s physical health.
Citing the report submitted by Safdar in the court on Thursday, he said Imran had first complained about an eye problem three months ago.
Despite repeated complaints and the worsening of his condition, the prison superintendent failed to ensure proper medical treatment and merely provided ordinary over-the-counter eye drops, Zafar said.
“Even when his condition deteriorated significantly and he reportedly lost vision in one eye, he was quietly taken to a hospital and brought back without transparency or proper disclosure,” he said.
Zafar stated that such conduct amounted to gross negligence and a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
He referred specifically to Article 9 (the right to life and liberty), Article 14 (the inviolability of the dignity of man) and Article 25 (equality before the law and equal protection of the law).
He emphasised that the right to life included the right to proper medical care, particularly when a person was in state custody.
“When the state detains an individual, it assumes full constitutional responsibility for his life, safety, and health. Any failure in this regard is a direct breach of the Constitution,” he said.
He demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a fully equipped hospital where qualified specialists, including his personal doctors, could examine and treat him properly.
He also demanded immediate and regular access to Imran for his family, and transparent and independent monitoring of his medical condition and care.
“This is not a political issue but a constitutional obligation. The protection of life and human dignity is a fundamental right, and the state must be held accountable for ensuring it,” he remarked.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl parliamentary leader Senator Kamran Murtaza said that the former prime minister’s eyesight was under threat. He endorsed the proposal that representatives from the opposition and government meet him.
Murtaza said that while injustices may have been committed in the past, they should not be committed now.
He said the options available included parole, bail, moving Imran to a hospital or declaring his house a sub-jail.
“Take the path that earns us respect in global democracies,” he said.
He said medical treatment was the constitutional right of every citizen, including the former prime minister under Article 9.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI’s Senator Dost Muhammad said he wanted to donate one of his eyes to the PTI founder. He also expressed serious concern over the health of the former premier.</p><small>2026-02-13 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13184758b0ff78e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972933/envoy-to-uae-denies-reports-of-gulf-country-suspending-transit-visas-for-pakistanis' target='_blank'><strong>Envoy to UAE denies reports of Gulf country suspending transit visas for Pakistanis</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday denied reports that the Gulf country has suspended the issuance of 96- and 48-hour transit visas for Pakistanis.
“It’s not true,” he said in response to Dawn’s query about reports circulating on social media.
The 96- and 48-hour transit visas are sponsored by the UAE-based airlines — Emirates and Etihad Airways — and must be processed and approved before entering the UAE, according to the information available on the government’s website.
“If you are not eligible for a visa on arrival or a visa-free entry to the UAE, and intend to step out of the airport, then you need a pre-arranged transit visa,” the website says.
Several users shared screenshots on social media that stated: “As per the latest information from USE immigration transit visas (96 Hours and 48 Hours Visa) for PAKISTAN nationals has been temporarily suspended. Hence, kindly do not apply for this 96 Hours and 48 Hours visa category.”
Others, meanwhile, just mentioned the reported suspension of the transit visas on X, citing a “notice”.
Past visa issues
Pakistanis have faced difficulties obtaining UAE visas over the past year. In January 2025, Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
He said that the UAE had concerns about Pakistanis travelling on visit visas and resorting to begging. However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the UAE.
In April, UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al Zaabi said visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could avail a five-year visa.
However, in early July, reports of visa rejections prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart. In a meeting that month, UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens, according to an official account of the talks.
On November 27, 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chau­dhry told a Senate functional committee that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis. He had also said Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
But that same day, UAE Amba­ssador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al-Bawab Al-Zaabi shared what was described as “major UAE visa facilitation refo­rms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said.
Last month, Pakistan and the UAE agreed to pursue a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals travelling to the Gulf country, the interior ministry said.
Under the proposed arrangement, immigration formalities wo­u­ld be completed in Pakistan before departure, allowing passengers to avoid routine immigration processing on arrival in the UAE.</p><small>2026-02-13 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1318485752857f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972927/ramazan-2026-this-planner-helps-you-slow-down-and-stay-balanced' target='_blank'><strong>Ramazan 2026: This planner helps you slow down and stay balanced</strong></a><br><p>This planner blends weekly structure with daily mindful actions, helping you move through Ramazan with balance, intention, and calm.

Week 1: Adjusting the rhythm
In a world where notifications never stop, and timelines dictate our moods, the first week of Ramazan is about consciously slowing down.

Social media may be filled with elaborate iftar spreads and productivity checklists, but this week reminds us that Ramazan is not a performance.

It is a personal reset. Step back from comparison, ease into the month gently, and focus on setting intentions rather than chasing perfection.
Day 1 – Set the pace
Plan sehri and iftar timings and aim for an early night. Begin the month with a sincere intention, reminding yourself why this month matters to you.
Day 2 – Stock and simplify
Buy fruits, dates, and vegetables that will sustain you through the week. Accept an invitation for iftar or share a meal, as Ramazan is also about connection.
Day 3 – Light iftar living
Prepare simple, homemade iftar items to avoid heaviness. Share food with someone fasting, even if it’s just a small portion.
Day 4 – Gentle movement
Take a short walk after iftar to aid digestion and clear your mind. Feed a stray animal or leave water outside. Remember, small acts of mercy matter.
Day 5 – Cut back carefully
Reduce tea and coffee to prevent dehydration. Be mindful of your words and actions, and keep every promise you make today.
Day 6 – Eat with awareness
Slow down at iftar and stop before feeling full. Show appreciation to someone serving you by giving a little extra or offering kind words.
Day 7 – Reflect and reset
Notice which foods suit your body best and adjust your meals accordingly. Spend time supporting or visiting children in need or an orphanage, if possible.

Week 2: Building Balance
By now, Ramazan has found its rhythm, but modern life continues to compete for attention. Online sales, Eid outfit launches, and social invitations begin to pick up pace. This week is about staying relevant and prepared without letting shopping or social obligations overshadow the spirit of the month. Plan mindfully, buy early if needed, but remember that balance is the goal.
Health focus: Add light exercise and focus on hydration between iftar and sleep.
Day 8 – Nourish better
Add a fresh salad to your iftar for balance. Forgive someone and feel the emotional weight lift.
Day 9 – Hydration check
Sip water regularly throughout the evening. Be conscious of your speech and guard your tongue from gossip or negativity.
Day 10 – Moderation day
Limit fried foods to one portion. Check in on an elderly relative or neighbour who may be feeling overlooked.
Day 11 – Home-cooked comfort
Plan one fully homemade iftar this week. Lend a hand in the kitchen and share the workload with family.
Day 12 – Quiet minutes
Spend ten calm minutes after taraweeh in reflection. Offer a couple of extra rak’ahs, focusing on presence rather than speed.
Day 13 – Rest intentionally
Sleep earlier to avoid burnout. Give charity quietly, without seeking recognition.
Day 14 – Simple sehri
Prepare a nourishing, uncomplicated sehri. Make du’a for someone who has hurt you. This is a powerful act of healing.

Week 3: Mindful Living
As the days move faster and Eid-related content fills screens and storefronts alike, this week invites conscious disengagement from constant stimulation. Endless scrolling, impulse buying, and comparison can quietly drain spiritual focus.

This is a good time to shop only with intention, reduce digital noise, and redirect attention inward as the most sacred nights approach.

The focus now shifts to awareness, kindness, and preparation for the last ten days.
Day 15 – Waste less
Be mindful of portions and avoid food waste at iftar. Appreciate every bite.
Day 16 – Digest and smile
Choose fruits after meals for digestion. Remember that a sincere smile is also an act of charity.
Day 17 – Ease the sugar
Reduce sugar in drinks and desserts. Share useful knowledge or advice kindly with someone who needs it.
Day 18 – Screen break
Step away from screens earlier at night. Practice listening patiently without interrupting others.
Day 19 – Gentle stretching
Do light stretching or walking before sehri. Offer water or snacks to workers you encounter.
Day 20 – Light iftar, clear mind
Keep iftar simple to improve focus during taraweeh. Reflect deeply on one Qur’anic verse.
Day 21 – Enter the last ten
Adjust your schedule for late-night prayers. Seek Laylatul Qadr on odd nights with sincerity.

Week 4: Reflection and continuity
The final days often arrive with a rush — last-minute shopping, tailoring deadlines, travel plans, and social expectations.
While preparation for Eid is necessary and joyful, this week is a reminder not to let consumption overpower contemplation.

Keep celebrations modest, hearts attentive, and intentions anchored in gratitude.

Day 22 – Plan rest
Schedule short rest periods during the day. Walk away from anger whenever it arises.
Day 23 – Simplify further
Keep meals minimal to conserve energy. Help someone financially if you are able.
Day 24 – Stillness
Spend extra time in quiet reflection or prayer. Make heartfelt du’a for those facing hardship.
Day 25 – Organised giving
Finalise zakat or charity distribution plans. Thank someone whose efforts often go unnoticed.
Day 26 – Digital detox
Limit social media after iftar. Try to avoid complaining throughout the day.
Day 27 – Rest for the night
Prioritise rest before long night prayers. Gently wake or remind someone for sehri or prayer.
Day 28 – Carry it forward
Reflect on habits you want to keep after Ramazan. Seek forgiveness from someone you may have hurt.
Day 29 – A modest Eid
Plan a simple, thoughtful Eid celebration. Pray for acceptance of all your efforts this month.
Day 30 – Beyond Ramadan
Reset your routine gently for life after Ramazan. Commit to carrying at least one Ramazan habit forward.

Palestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly taken “direct action” against Israel-linked defence companies in Britain, often blocking entrances or spraying red paint.
Britain argued the group’s actions amounted to terrorism, citing a 2024 raid on a factory of Israel’s largest defence firm Elbit Systems, in which prosecutors said activists caused around £1 million ($1.4 m) of damage and a police officer was hit with a sledgehammer.
Ban followed break-in at air base
Palestine Action was banned shortly after a June break-in at the Royal Air Force’s Brize Norton air base, in which activists damaged two planes, an action described by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as “disgraceful”.
Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest.
Judge Victoria Sharp said Palestine Action “promotes its political cause through criminality and the encouragement of criminality”.
The High Court nonetheless ruled the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression, though the ban was not lifted ahead of a further hearing to decide whether it should remain pending an appeal.
Interior minister Shabana Mahmood said in a statement: “I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
Government defeat follows ‘not guilty’ verdicts
The ban put Palestine Action on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and made it a criminal offence to be a member, carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence.
More than 2,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group though Friday’s ruling could lead to any criminal charges being dropped.
London’s Metropolitan Police said following the judgment that it would focus on gathering evidence where people expressed support for Palestine Action rather than making arrests.
Civil liberties groups, including Amnesty International, had called for the ban to be lifted and Irish novelist Sally Rooney said it could even lead to her books being withdrawn from sale due to her public support for Palestine Action.
The British government argued proscription only prevented support for Palestine Action and had not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian cause.
The High Court, however, said it could cause pro-Palestinian protesters to “exercise self-restraint in terms of what they say and what they do”.
The judgment was announced two weeks after six people charged over the 2024 raid on Elbit were all acquitted of aggravated burglary.
Prosecutors have said they will seek a retrial on those counts on which the jury could not reach a verdict, including the alleged assault on a police officer.</p><small>2026-02-13 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13180039ed349df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972931/dubais-dp-world-replaces-leader-after-he-is-named-in-epstein-emails' target='_blank'><strong>Dubai’s DP World replaces leader after he is named in Epstein emails</strong></a><br><p>Dubai’s DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.
“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,” the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
The statement did not mention Sulayem.
Described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends”, Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.
He is cited more than 9,400 times in the documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which revealed close ties between the two men.
They maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.
The correspondence suggests he visited the US sex offender in his home several times, including on his island.</p><small>2026-02-13 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13165013bed13e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972925/short-term-inflation-decreases-059-per-cent' target='_blank'><strong>Short-term inflation decreases 0.59 per cent</strong></a><br><p>Short-term inflation in Pakistan, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending on February 12, decreased 0.59 per cent, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
The SPI-based inflation has been on an upward trend for the past few weeks, mainly driven by a surge in prices of perishable products, pulses, and meat.
Major decreases noted during this time period were in the prices of eggs (17.61pc), followed by tomatoes (12.02pc), chicken (6.34pc), onions (2.73pc), potatoes (2.49pc), salt powder (1.69pc), LPG (1.57pc), wheat flour (1.31pc), and sugar (1.12pc).

The year-on-year data show a 4.26pc increase.
The major influences contirbuting to this annual trend were an increase in tomatoes (73.36pc), wheat flour (33.82pc), gas charges for Q1 (29.85pc), chilli powder (15.20pc), beef (12.70pc), eggs (11.76pc), bananas (11.67pc), firewood (11.40pc), LPG (10.73pc), powdered milk (9.89pc), shirting (8.82pc) and gur (8.81pc).

The Pakistan National Report 2025 was released by the GMMP’s Pakistan partner, Uks Research Centre. It was based on the monitoring of the news landscape on May 6 last year — a day “marked by severe military and political tensions along the Line of Control with India” — which shaped the news content and the visibility of women across different platforms.
“The data captures not just a single day’s news, but the outcome of decades of institutional and societal factors that shape women’s visibility in Pakistani media,” the report said, adding, “On a day that was dominated by overwhelming national security coverage, these findings show broader systemic trends.”
According to the report, the monitoring was based on nine print newspapers, six television channels, the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation radio channel, and four news-based websites. Thirteen volunteers participated in the monitoring, including Uks staff and students from various universities.
It found that women constituted only 11 per cent of news subjects across traditional media (print, television and radio), reflecting “their marginalisation in the coverage of politics, economy, crime, and sports”.
Across these platforms, they appeared most frequently in arts, culture, and celebrity reporting (60pc) and science and health (28pc), but were nearly absent in the hard-news areas highlighted above, ranging from 0-10pc in each area as well as in Gender-Based Violence (GBV) coverage.
However, digital media platforms highlighted greater inclusivity, as women made up 26pc of subjects in internet news. They were also visible in politics (23pc), science and health (33pc), social and legal issues (33pc), and were “central” to all monitored GBV stories (100pc).
“These findings illustrate a consistent platform-based gap, with online news offering women a higher likelihood of visibility,” the report stated.
It further said that the role of women in news production remained “extremely limited”, with men dominating reporting roles across all media.
Notably, in print, bylines by women comprised 5pc of the total, while radio showed 100pc female reporting on the monitoring day — although the report warned against generalisation due to a small sample size.
The report added that of the 29pc of news reported or presented by women, 96pc of them served as anchors or presenters and only 4pc were field reporters.
“Women reporters were largely absent from producing stories about men as subjects. On the other hand, men reported almost all the stories that featured women subjects,” it added.
GBV coverage on the monitoring day was limited, with only a single story recorded in traditional media. Online outlets, however, addressed sexual harassment and technology-facilitated violence and often also talked about broader gender inequality and rights-based perspectives, it said.
Meanwhile, women’s visibility as central subjects was limited, with only 15pc of news stories featuring women as the main focus, according to the report. Women’s news subjects primarily represented government officials or politicians and were rarely in roles providing personal experience or as experts.
In addition, the report highlighted that women were identified by their family roles or status in 15pc of cases compared to only 2pc for men.
A greater percentage of men were reported as victims, while photographs “disproportionately showed men” over women, and direct quotes were overwhelmingly given by men, with only 10.5pc of quotes attributed to women.
“Overall, only 1pc of the news content challenged gender stereotypes, and only 1pc of stories highlighted issues of gender equality or inequality between women and men,” it said.
According to the report’s executive summary, the findings “confirm patterns that have continued to endure in Pakistani news”.
However, they also highlighted the potential of digital media platforms to “create professional opportunities for women in journalism and to frame issues through a gendered and rights-based lens”, which in turn would improve their visibility and representation in media.</p><small>2026-02-13 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13150604a50758d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917/first-day-of-ramazan-likely-to-fall-on-february-19-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>First day of Ramazan likely to fall on February 19: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said on Friday that the first day of Ramazan is “likely to fall” on February 19, 2026.
The new moon is expected to be born on Feb 17, 2026, at 5:01pm, according to the statement by the space agency.
“At the time of sunset on Feb 18, 2026, the age of the new moon will be approximately 25 hours and 48 minutes. The time duration between sunset and moonset is expected to be 59 minutes along the coastal areas of the country,” added the Suparco statement.
“Consequently, the 1st of Ramazan may likely to fall on 19 Feb 2026.”
However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.
Earlier this week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) stated that there is a “fair chance” of sighting the new moon of Ramazan on the evening of February 18.
“According to astronomical parameters, there is a ‘fair chance’ of sighting the new moon of Ramazan 1447 AH on the evening of February 18, 2026,” it said.
Furthermore, the weather is expected to be partly cloudy or fair in most parts of the country on Feb 18, it added.</p><small>2026-02-13 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1309104982c0ead.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972897/un-extends-mandate-of-taliban-sanctions-monitoring-team-amid-regional-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>UN extends mandate of Taliban sanctions monitoring team amid regional security concerns</strong></a><br><p>The UN Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Taliban.
All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation.
Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone.







“Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations.
“It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said.
The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said.
“Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.”
The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP.







The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups.
While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.”
Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions.
On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region.
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat.
Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban.
TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat.
The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region.
ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions.
Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources.
The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime.
Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.</p><small>2026-02-13 05:38</small></div><hr>
