<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2614013563c0587.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957489/brazils-bolsonaro-begins-27-year-jail-term-for-coup-bid' target='_blank'><strong>Brazil’s Bolsonaro begins 27-year jail term for coup bid</strong></a><br><p>Brazil’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a failed coup, after he exhausted all appeals.
The brash former army captain, who fired up Brazil’s right and reshaped the country’s politics, is ending a divisive career jailed in a small room at police headquarters equipped with a TV, mini-fridge, and air-conditioning.
Bolsonaro, 70, was convicted in September over a scheme to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office as president after the 2022 elections, a plan that included a plot to kill the veteran leftist.
Prosecutors said the scheme failed only due to a lack of support from military top brass.
 


The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month and ruled the judgment final. The court also ordered a military tribunal to decide whether Bolsonaro should be stripped of his captain’s rank.
Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron.
Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said there were signs Bolsonaro planned to flee during a vigil organised by his son outside his home.
The justice cited the nearby US embassy and Bolsonaro’s close relationship with former US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have sought political asylum.
Bolsonaro said he acted out of “paranoia” induced by medication and denied attempting to escape.
The court ruled Bolsonaro will remain detained in the officers’ room, a secure space for protected prisoners, in Brasilia.
Five of his co-accused, including military generals and former ministers, also began serving sentences of between 19 and 26 years on Tuesday.
Former intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, sentenced to 16 years, was declared a fugitive after fleeing to the United States.
Bolsonaro’s defence lawyer, Paulo Cunha Bueno, called the closure of the case “surprising” and said he would file an appeal regardless.
Brazilian congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son, was also charged on Tuesday with obstruction of justice after promoting Trump-era measures seeking to interfere with his father’s trial.
‘Extremely fragile’
Bolsonaro is the fourth former president to be imprisoned since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985.
In May, Fernando Collor de Mello was allowed to serve his nearly nine-year sentence for corruption at home due to health concerns.
Bolsonaro’s defence team argues he should receive the same treatment, warning that detention endangers his life.
He suffers the consequences of a stab wound sustained during a 2018 campaign attack and has required several follow-up surgeries.
He also experiences persistent “uncontrollable hiccups” linked to gastric issues, leaving him breathless and fainting, according to doctors.
 
 

Bolsonaro’s family has highlighted his poor mental and physical state. After visiting him on Tuesday, Carlos Bolsonaro described his father as “extremely fragile and psychologically devastated,” adding: “He’s eating very little — there’s no way for someone who knows he didn’t commit a crime to see this as normal.”
Bolsonaro, president from 2019 to 2022, maintains his innocence and claims political persecution.
With Bolsonaro sidelined, Brazil’s large conservative electorate lacks a champion ahead of the 2026 presidential elections, in which Lula, 80, has said he will seek a fourth term.
Lula himself was jailed between mandates for corruption but had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court after a year and a half.</p><small>2025-11-26 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26153526afc9a0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957467/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-bahrain-for-2-day-visit-receives-warm-welcome-by-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Bahrain for 2-day visit; receives warm welcome by leadership</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday arrived in Bahrain’s capital Manama for a two-day visit.
According to Pakistan Television (PTV), the premier received a warm welcome at the Manama airport by Bahrain’s Crown Prince and PM Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Deputy PM Khalid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Foreign Minister Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, and senior members of the Bahraini leadership.
 






The delegation also includes Deputy PM and FM Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, and other senior officials.
During the visit from November 26 to 27, PM Shehbaz will hold “high-level” meetings with the Bahraini leadership.
These meetings, as per PTV, will include engagements with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad and Deputy PM Sheikh Khalid bin Abdullah.
“This official visit reflects the longstanding cordial relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and Pakistan, with the aim of promoting a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries,” state media said.
“The visit will strengthen traditionally warm and cordial relations, chart new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people connections, which will contribute to mutually beneficial cooperation,” it added.
Last month, the two countries agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in different fields during the first meeting of the Pakistan-Bahrain Parliamentary Friendship Group.
They also agreed to establish a joint working group to enhance collaboration in areas such as counter-narcotics, counterterrorism, coastguard operations, border security, immigration and police training and decided to sign memoranda of understanding on extradition, mutual legal assistance and specialised battalion training.
In September, the countries had also agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration during a meeting between Interior Minister Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart, Gen Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa.</p><small>2025-11-26 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26160035421f511.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957479/lawyers-protest-in-karachi-demand-protection-and-preservation-of-karoonjhar-mountain-range' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers protest in Karachi, demand protection and preservation of Karoonjhar Mountain range</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers held a protest march in Karachi on Wednesday, demanding “immediate” steps for the protection and preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range.
Located in Tharparkar, the mountain range rises to a height of 305 metres and runs approximately 19 kilometres in length. Karoonjhar alsi has economic significance for the local people as it is rich in minerals and plants having medicinal value.
The Sindh High Court Bar Association had announced a protest today, calling for the preservation of the mountain range, and planned to march from the Sindh High Court to the Chief Minister House.
However, the protesters were barred from reaching the CM House due to the placement of containers to block the routes leading to the building. The measure also created inconvenience for the commuters who asked by the traffic police in multiple advisories to travel on alternative routes.
Police personnel were also deployed in the area.
The SHCBA protesters, meanwhile, gathered at PIDC Chowk, where the president of the lawyers’ body, Barrister Sarfaraz Metlo, addressed the demonstrators.
He accused the Sindh government of having a “dual policy”, saying that the provincial government was “with those leasing out the [mountain site] and, at the same time, was also aligned with those protesting against the move”.
“Karoonjhar Mountain belongs to Sindh. We demand the withdrawal of the [former] caretaker provincial government,” he said, apparently referring to a proposal by the last caretaker Sindh government for initiating a granite excavation project.
He also called for the provincial government to withdraw it appeal filed regarding the matter in the court, warning that the lawyers would hold another protest after 15 days if their demand was not met.
The Sindh government has challenged a two-judge SHC bench judgement on the preservation of Karoonjhar Hills.
Barrister Metlo, along with other representatives of the SHCBA, later visited the CM House for negotiations with the government, following which the lawyers ended the protest.
After the meeting at the CM House, Barrister Metlo said while speaking to the media that they had met Sindh Law Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar. He claimed that the minister had assured him that the Sindh government would withdraw its appeal and committed to declaring the Karoonjhar Mountain range a national heritage site.
He also claimed that the law minister had told him and his companions during the meeting that the Sindh government had “ended the contract for the lease of 21,000 acres” of the mountain site.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the CM Office said the lawyers’ delegation presented a memorandum and their demands in writing to the law minister.
The CM Office’s statement quoted the memorandum as stating that the SHCBA “expresses reservations over existing and potential dangers faced by the mountain range. This mountain is a natural, cultural and historical heritage of Sindh, and its loss is irreparable”.
The lawyers demanded “immediate and concrete” measures for the protection, survival and upkeep of the mountain range, according to the statement.
It said Law Minister Lanjar assured the lawyers’ delegation that his party, the PPP, was determined to protect the natural, cultural and historical heritage of the province.
“The land of Sindh is entrusted to us by our ancestors, and the government considers the protection of [Sindh’s] environment, mountains, natural resources and cultural identity its constitutional and moral responsibility,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
The law minister assured the lawyers that necessary legal, administrative and practical steps would be taken to protect all historical and environmental sites of Sindh, including Karoonjhar.
According to the statement, Lanjar said recommendations of the legal community would be given “serious” consideration.
“Damage to natural, environmental and cultural assets of Sindh will not be allowed under any circumstances,” Lanjar added.
The statement said the two sides also signed a memorandum after the meeting.
Later, lawyers from the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also reached PIDC Chowk. Police deployment was also increased in the area after KBA lawyers arrived at the site.
Police then negotiated with the protesters.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Asad Raza told the media that they were trying to convince the lawyers to end their protest.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261432329705240.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957490/coas-munir-meets-irans-security-chief-stresses-need-for-counter-terrorism-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir meets Iran’s security chief, stresses need for counter-terrorism collaboration</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday met with Iran’s top security official Ali Ardeshir Larijani in Rawalpindi, where he stressed the need for counter-terrorism cooperation between their countries.
Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Secu­ri­­ty Council (SNSC), called on the army chief at the General Headquarters in the garrison city, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, COAS Munir emphasised the “need for closer collaboration with Iran to combat terrorism”.
“He also highlighted the growing importance of strategic cooperation in light of the evolving geopolitical situation,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media affairs wing described Larijani as Iran’s NSA (national security adviser).

Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul amid rising cross-border tensions.
Islamabad and Tehran had also vowed to enhance joint efforts to eradicate terrorism in both countries when Iranian Parliament Speaker Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad earlier this month.
Today’s meeting between COAS Munir and Larijani focused on bilateral cooperation, regional security issues, and the importance of strengthening ties between Pakistan and Iran. “Both dignitaries discussed the prevailing security dynamics in the region,” the ISPR added.
On his part, Larijani acknowledged “Pakistan’s vital role in ensuring peace and security in the region and expressed his commitment to furthering Iran-Pakistan ties”, according to the ISPR.
The Iranian top official also underlined the significance of dialogue and partnership between the two nations in tackling regional challenges and ensuring long-term stability.
Larijani’s visit
Larijani, who arrived in Pakistan on Monday, met with President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq yesterday.
He is also scheduled to meet National Security Adviser Lt Gen Asim Malik, also the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
Larijani’s trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, which Pakistan has supported and is seen as a potential contributor to an international stabilisation force envisioned under it.
 
 

Though Pakistan’s statements on the SNSC official’s meetings did not say much on discussions about the Gaza plan, Larijani, in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s greetings to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
“This reflects the firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people,” he said.
Larijani’s trip also comes on the heels of the Saudi armed forces’ chief visiting Pakistan, with him and Pakistani officials mostly discussing defence partnership and counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26150037a64b342.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957491/in-additional-note-justice-najafi-says-noor-mukadam-case-direct-result-of-vice-known-as-living-relationship' target='_blank'><strong>In additional note, Justice Najafi says Noor Mukadam case direct result of ‘vice’ known as ‘living relationship’</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court, has observed that the Noor Mukadam case is the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”, it emerged on Wednesday.
It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge SC bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Subsequently, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the newly established FCC.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which surfaced today, Justice Najafi, while upholding the sentence awarded to Zahir, observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
Justice Najafi went on to say that engaging in a relationship like that was a “direct revolt against Almighty Allah,” calling on the younger generation to note its “horrible consequences, such as in the present case, which is also a topic for the social reformist to discuss in their circles”.
Justice Najafi further said that in his view, “no mitigating circumstances existed in the present case.
He noted that the “minor discrepancies in the time of occurrence, the delay in postmortem, absence of the finger prints on the knife but matched with the DNA of the petitioner, minor delay in lodging the first information would not affect the credibility of the prosecution evidence, which had circumstantial evidence.”
“One end of the rope is found tied with the dead body of Noor Mukadam, and the other end tied with the neck of the petitioner,” he said.
The case
Noor was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report was registered later the same day against Zahir, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, were indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents.
According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court (IHC), dismissing Zahir’s appeal against the conviction, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
In May of this year, the SC upheld the death sentence of Zahir for the murder of Noor.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26143125f433e13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957492/fo-voices-grave-concern-over-un-report-on-human-rights-violations-in-occupied-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>FO voices ‘grave concern’ over UN report on human rights violations in occupied Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday expressed “grave concern” over a United Nations (UN) report that observed systemic human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.
UN experts on Monday raised the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the government of India in the aftermath of a terror attack in Pahalgam in April this year, for which Delhi blamed Islamabad without any evidence.
A press release issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan notes with grave concern the latest findings by the United Nations Special Procedures experts regarding India’s illegal measures in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).”
It said that the report “once again underscores the severe and systematic human rights violations endured by the Kashmiri people under Indian occupation”.
It noted “with alarm” the UN experts’ observations that India’s actions had resulted in the “extensive arbitrary arrest and detention of nearly 2,800 individuals, including journalists, students, and human rights advocates”.
“The persistent application of draconian legislation, such as the Public Safety Act (PSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), has facilitated indefinite and unjustifiable detentions,” it added.
“Instances of torture, custodial deaths, incommunicado detention, denial of due legal process and family contact, punitive demolitions and forced evictions, recurring communication blackouts, and suppression of press freedom — including the blocking of 8,000 social media accounts — as well as the rise in hate speech, lynching, and harassment directed at Kashmiris and Muslim communities across India, are equally deplorable and deeply troubling,” the statement said.
It added, “These findings reaffirm Pakistan’s longstanding concerns regarding state-sponsored persecution of Kashmiri Muslims as well as discrimination against minorities across India.”
 






The FO called upon India to “cease its coercive measures” and to unconditionally release all arbitrarily detained individuals in India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. It also urged India to take concrete steps to end the persecution of all religious minorities, “particularly Muslims and Christians”.
“Pakistan reiterates its commitment to a peaceful, just, and enduring resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” it said.
The FO urged India to “halt its repressive policies, reverse demographic and legal alterations, restore fundamental freedoms, and engage sincerely in meaningful dialogue”.
“Pakistan will continue to extend moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle against foreign occupation,” it added.
The UN experts’ findings had noted that Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions, forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, and noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members.
“These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261325334cc2ed3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957481/paa-denies-reports-alleging-major-disaster-averted-at-islamabad-airport-says-it-was-standard-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>PAA denies reports alleging ‘major disaster’ averted at Islamabad airport, says it was standard exercise</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday denied media reports alleging that an accident was averted at the Islamabad airport as a foreign carrier narrowly avoided landing on a closed runway, saying that it was “standard and internationally practised safety measure”.
The statement came after multiple media outlets reported  on Tuesday that flight SV278 — operated by Saudia Airlines from Jeddah to Islamabad — narrowly avoided a “major disaster” as the air traffic controller timely prevented the pilot from landing the plane on the wrong runway.
The flight was scheduled to arrive at the airport at 4:05pm, but landed with a delay of more than an hour at 5:13pm, according to the tracker flightradar24.
In a statement issued today, the PAA said, “The recent go-around at Islamabad International Airport involving flight SV728 was a standard and internationally practised safety measure, executed precisely as per established protocols.”
A go-around is a “safe, routine manoeuvre” that discontinues the landing approach and returns the aircraft to an altitude and configuration for another safe attempt, according to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration.
“Go-arounds are common, non-emergency procedures carried out to ensure the highest level of operational safety,” it explained.
In its statement, the PAA requested media outlets to “avoid presenting routine aviation procedures in a sensational manner”.
“Sensational reporting may unintentionally create unnecessary concern among the travelling public and lead to misunderstandings about normal aviation practices,” the authority cautioned.
It affirmed that the PAA “values the media’s role as an important partner in keeping the public informed and encourages continued responsible reporting based on verified information”.
“PAA remains committed to transparency and to maintaining the highest safety standards across all airports in Pakistan,” it added.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261259547d053a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957480/south-africa-condemn-india-to-biggest-test-loss-for-series-sweep' target='_blank'><strong>South Africa condemn India to biggest Test loss for series sweep</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Simon Harmer took six wickets as South Africa thrashed India by 408 runs in the second Test on Wednesday to sweep the series and condemn the hosts to a record loss.
It was South Africa’s first series win in India in 25 years, after bowling the home team out for a dismal 140 in a mammoth chase of 549 on day five in Guwahati.
India suffered their biggest Test defeat by runs and a fifth loss in seven home Tests, having been whitewashed 3-0 by New Zealand last year.
Off-spinner Harmer, 36, returned figures of 6-37 as South Africa clinched a Test series in India for only the second time, the first in 2000 under Hansie Cronje.
“Winning a Test match and series in India is very special,” said left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 6-48 in India’s first innings after smashing a quickfire 93 with the bat.
Jansen, named player of the match, added: “Very well done to everyone for putting their hand up and making this happen.”
India lost the opening Test in Kolkata inside three days on a pitch with uneven bounce before South Africa once again beat the hosts in their own game of spin on a batting-friendly track.
Ravindra Jadeja resisted with 54 before Keshav Maharaj had him stumped and the spinner soon got the final wicket of Mohammed Siraj, with Jansen pulling off a stunning catch in the deep.
The visitors had declared their second innings on 260-5 on day four to hand India a record chase but the hosts’ batting once again failed and they never threatened to get close.
“Whether you’re playing at home or away cricket demands that determination and the extra effort,” said India captain Rishabh Pant.
“As a batting unit you need to capitalise on certain moments. As a team we didn’t do that.”
India rode their luck early in the day when Jansen had Sai Sudharsan caught behind but the delivery was declared a no-ball after the bowler overstepped. The batter was on four.
In the next over Kuldeep Yadav survived a reprieve on four when Aiden Markram dropped him at first slip off Harmer.
But the relief was short-lived for India as a relentless Harmer bowled Kuldeep for five for the first wicket of the day.
Three balls later the spinner dismissed Dhruv Jurel for two and soon sent back Pant for 13 as India slumped to 58-5.
The batters fell like nine pins on a pitch where South Africa posted 489 after they elected to bat.
India were bundled out for 201 to concede a first-innings lead of 288 but South Africa did not enforce the follow-on and decided to bat again.
South African all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy led the batting charge in the first innings with 109, his maiden Test century.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261218450d552be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957477/retired-judge-yar-muhammad-sworn-in-as-gb-caretaker-chief-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Retired judge Yar Muhammad sworn in as GB caretaker chief minister</strong></a><br><p>Retired judge Yar Muhammad was sworn in on Wednesday as the caretaker chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan in a ceremony held at the Governor House.
He was appointed for the role by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the GB Assembly completed its five-year tenure on Monday. According to the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days following the completion of the assembly’s tenure.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah administered the oath to Muhammad in a ceremony attended by federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and Safron Engineer Amir Muqam, other political figures, judges and local administration officials.
During the ceremony, GB Services Department Secretary Usman Ahmed read out the notification for the appointment of the caretaker chief minister.
Assembly’s tenure
After the GB Assembly elections on Nov 15, 2020 across 24 constituencies, the PTI had formed the government in the region with Khalid Khurshid elected as the chief minister.
However, following Khurshid’s disqualification in July 2023, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI, PPP and PML-N parties with Haji Gulbar Khan — an estranged PTI member — as the new chief minister of the region.
Khurshid was disqualified by the GB Chief Court for allegedly obtaining a license from the GB Bar Council on the basis of a fake degree.
During its five-year tenure, the GB Assembly adopted 63 bills. The assembly also passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare GB a provisional province of Pakistan.
A dozen bills were passed in the final session of the assembly on Monday before the completion of its tenure at midnight.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25110504a482a1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957074/perth-a-hara-kiri-in-two-acts' target='_blank'><strong>Perth: A hara-kiri in two acts</strong></a><br><p>The match ended in two days. Two days. What should have been a five-day odyssey, a slow-burning masterpiece of tension, courage, and human drama, collapsed before it began. I was left with grief, disbelief, and an unspent ritual, a void that demanded attention.
I turned to writing as therapy. And thus, days three and four of the intended Test match between Australia and England became research and reflection, a way to wrest meaning from this disappointment. I spoke to friends from Karachi to Oxford, some who had travelled to Perth, all as desperate as I was to make sense of this reality. I spoke to friends in Silicon Valley, untouched by the pains of cricket, yet intimately familiar with the bruises of the design process.
By the time what would have been day five arrived, the fantasy finish that never was, I had poured every ounce of grief and disbelief, with small sparks of hope, into my writing. Rarely have I managed to channel frustration into something meaningful. Perhaps never.

And if this piece has any clarity at all, it is because of my wife, who endured my moping, my long disappearances into this private vortex, and then sifted through every version and carved every sentence until it caught the light. Any polish this piece possesses is hers.
This is my offering: a tribute to the ritual denied, the lessons hidden in sudden failure, and to all those who helped me navigate the hara-kiri at Perth.
The unraveling
It was the hour of 18:20 when my Friday truly began. My body had been awake since morning, but my spirit obeys only the slow-moving sun of Test cricket. Wherever in the world a real Test match unfolds, my internal clock bends to its rhythm, and so at 18:20, when most of Palo Alto was winding down, I was only just coming alive.
I hijacked my nephew’s evening first; a grad student, earnest enough to humour an uncle possessed by cricket madness, he followed me into the dining hall where, without warning or apology, we converted Stanford’s quiet civility into a Karachi sports bar. It was absurd, it was brilliant, and it was ours.
We slipped into memory as easily as one slips into a stance: that cramped Princeton basement, 12-year-old him hurling tennis balls at 28-year-old me, both of us convinced that perfection was a moral duty. Mitchell Starc had been our shared north star then, the left-arm action he tried to imitate, the blueprint of a dream he never quite abandoned. And now, years later, here we were, two adults with allegedly serious lives, cheering and wincing in equal measure at every delivery by Starc.
 
 

By 20:20, the first session closed. England dominant. Calm restored. A brief, golden intermission where life felt almost gracious. We now inducted his wife, a Stegner fellow and brilliant poet, into our improvised support group. She brewed the Darjeeling and infused an intellectual flair into our conversation. Only Test cricket grants such liberties: infinite reflection, five days to think, to ache, to witness a story unfolding at the speed of truth.
And then, 55 minutes later, Steve Smith took that catch. Something in me snapped clean; they needed to be 150 runs ahead before this loss, and I informed my support group that the unravelling had begun.
England, presented with a timid Australian attack, chose wrong over wrong with mechanical consistency. I shifted screens, changed geographies, searched for refuge in another universe: the South Africa-India Test. Stubbs dancing down at Kuldeep, surviving Bumrah … it should have been enough to salvage the evening. But the ache of watching Stokes fail swallowed everything.
And then Travis Head walked in.

“Cricket requires one to assume such indecent postures.” Clearly, Oscar Wilde is watching this with me, because there it was: indecency in motion. Head’s batting, a triumph of utility over grace, is an affront to beauty itself. No flourish, no poetry, no seduction. Just pure, unfiltered productivity. Shot after shot landing like administrative memos. Efficient. Necessary.
I knew I was projecting my grief, unfairly stapled to this man. Yet I stared, transfixed. Travis Head turned elegance into currency, verse into invoice, and I watched him like a willing masochist, fully complicit in my own suffering.
I do not seek pain. I am not self-sabotaging. Yet there I was, forced to live the very doctrine I preach to founders and leaders: great design emerges only through messy, painful prototyping. I leaned on David Kelley and Bill Burnett, my design thinking mentors, who insist that prototypes burn … they must burn. I stitch their wisdom to the lessons imparted by my cricketing ustaads, and the chaos on the screen gained a strange clarity. The unravelling. The absurdity. The sharp sting of disappointment. It hurt. It challenged. It taught.
Perth was not a terminal failure. It was a prototype burning to reveal the questions I had refused to ask.

And this, ultimately, is why I write. Not to teach. Not to instruct. But to survive the blow. To process. To remind myself that walking the talk is brutal, human, and strangely beautiful. Perth is not the end. It is a question that surfaced, a prototype sacrificed so something wiser, braver, and more honest might emerge. And that truth is harder to swallow when the prototype happens to be the only inspiring idea left in modern cricket.
For the last 18 months, Ben Stokes has been attempting something that most sporting leaders never dare to attempt. He has been trying to build a long-format masterpiece inside a short-format world. He is attempting, sometimes very imperfectly, to redesign Test cricket itself. This is why this two-day Test match hurts. This is why the loss feels tragic. And this is why it also feels important.
Because what Stokes is doing is not entertainment. It is designed. And design, as we teach it, is brutal. It demands failure early, failure publicly, failure in ways that look embarrassing before they look beautiful. His defeat matters because the experiment matters. And the experiment matters because Test cricket’s future now depends on the success of a handful of dreamers who still believe that this sport can be a cathedral, not a casino. Stokes is one of them. Maybe the last of them. And Perth was his first real heartbreak.
A 5-day match is a 5-day examination of the human condition
There is a reason it’s called Test cricket. It does not reward brilliance in flashes. It demands the slow burn of genius. It asks for stamina of mind, appetite for suffering, and a near-spiritual commitment to craft. It is the opposite of modern life. It is the opposite of instant reward.
A Test match gives you time to dream, time to recover, time to fight back, time to win ugly, time to unravel, time to reinvent yourself within the same contest. It is a sport designed to examine temperament and talent in the same breath.
And this is where England faltered on day two in Perth. Their aggression, thrilling on day one, suddenly looked cavalier. What had appeared inspired began to look impatient. Their strokes lacked the humility required by a harsh pitch. Their bowlers tried too hard to force miracles. Their nerves betrayed their ideas.

In a five-day contest, this is fatal.
The first truth of Test cricket is simple: brilliance must be sustained, not performed. Grit and imagination must sit side by side. You cannot survive on genius alone. You must endure, iterate, and keep walking through fire long after your confidence has evaporated.
And that is the missing piece in Ben Stokes’s design masterclass. Not courage. Not creativity. The missing piece is longevity.
The T20 imagination crisis: How administrators turned dreamers into accountants
Let us be clear. The crisis of Test cricket is not about Australia or England or even about who loses or wins. The deeper crisis comes from a group of administrators who lacked imagination at the very moment the sport received the greatest financial windfall in its history.
The explosion of T20 leagues brought money, celebrity, and global attention. But instead of building Test academies, long-form coaching pipelines, or 10-year development ecosystems, cricket’s leaders chased the profits of the carnival.
They took the revenue of a golden age and spent it on more carnivals.
 
 

So what happens in countries like Pakistan, the West Indies, and Afghanistan? Countries brimming with raw genius, ferocious young fast bowlers, fearless batters, and a culture of street cricket that produces more imagination per square foot than any high-performance lab?
What happens is tragic.
The youth see only one currency: fast fame, fast money, fast leagues.

At 18, when they should be dreamers, they are told to think like accountants. Their bodies are treated like assets. Their talent is trimmed into something that fits a four-over job description. Their ambition shrinks to franchise contracts because no one around them dares to tell them that Test cricket is worth fighting for.
T20 is TikTok. Test cricket is Tarantino.
If the only filmmaking that exists is TikTok, then the next generation will never learn to appreciate narrative, complexity, tension, or depth. They will grow up believing cinema is fifteen seconds of dopamine.
That is what we are risking with cricket. A dystopia where the sport forgets its soul. And in such a world, the very few who choose the long format are not just players. They are custodians of a cultural inheritance.
Which brings us back to Stokes.
Perth as prototype: Why this failure matters and why it is not final
When Steve Jobs was designing the first iPhone, the early prototypes were disasters. Nothing worked. The screen glitched. The interface collapsed. The team doubted the idea itself. But Steve persisted because he wasn’t designing for the present. He was designing for a future only he could see.
He was designing for longevity, not applause.
This is where Stokes finds himself. He has rewired the spirit of his team. He has attracted brilliant thinkers. He has redefined the culture. He has turned Test cricket into a theatre again.

But the one skill still missing is the slow craft of sustaining genius across five days. That, unfortunately, is the one thing Test cricket does not forgive.
But failure is part of great design. In Silicon Valley, we teach it outright: fail early, fail gracefully, fail without losing your appetite for the next experiment. The prototype only breaks you if you mistake it for a finished product.
Stokes is not finished. England are not finished. They are still in the workshop. And Perth was a reminder that radical ideas need reinforcement, not retreat.
The global stakes: Why the next four Tests are not about England and Australia
This is not an Ashes story anymore. It is a Test cricket story.
The next four matches matter because children in Karachi, Kabul, and Barbados are watching. They are watching to see whether long-form courage still has a place in a world obsessed with short-form comfort. They are watching to see if there is something noble left in the sport.

The child in Karachi wants to believe that he can dream beyond franchise contracts. The child in Kabul wants to believe that his cricket can transcend politics. The child in Barbados wants to believe that the legacy of Marshall and Garner still has a future and will continue to serve as his individual identity.
Test cricket is their Tarantino film in a TikTok world. Ben Stokes is the only director still trying to make it.
And that is why this loss, painful as it is, cannot be the end.
The work ahead: Genius, longevity, and the courage to continue
Steve Jobs said it best: surround A-players with anything less and the whole system dulls.
Not long ago, an Ollie Robinson passed as perfectly acceptable to the establishment and to viewers alike; tidy average, no voltage, the patron saint of ‘good enough.’ His very acceptability said more about the era than the bowler.
Stokes has shattered that era. He has shown the world a new imagination.
Now he must add the last ingredient: the long, sustained mastery that Test cricket rewards.

He must teach his team to hold genius for five days. To absorb pressure. To win ugly. To trust their ideas through fire. To understand that innovation must coexist with attrition.
Because Test cricket is a masterpiece. And masterpieces evolve slowly.
England will rise again. Not because of desire but because of design. And because Stokes, unlike most leaders in sport, is crafting a legacy, not a season.
This defeat is not the end. It is the difficult middle of a great story. And if the story ends well, Stokes will be remembered not as a rebel captain but as the man who saved Test cricket from the poverty of short-term thinking.
The work continues. The design continues. The belief continues.
And so must we.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26122719b5420b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957473/integral-inalienable-part-of-india-new-delhi-responds-to-beijings-claim-over-arunachal-pradesh' target='_blank'><strong>‘Integral, inalienable part of India’: New Delhi responds to Beijing’s claim over Arunachal Pradesh</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi has asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an “integral part” of India in response to Beijing’s claim over the territory as the two countries rowed over the detention of an Indian citizen at Shanghai Airport.
On Tuesday, India had issued a demarche to China over the detention of Prema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based woman from Arunachal Pradesh, at the Shanghai airport. Thongdok had said immigration officials had held for 18 hours and “mocked” her by saying the region was not a part of India.
China says Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Zangnan, is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.
Responding to queries during a press briefing on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said that “Zangnan is China’s territory”.
“The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally set up by India,” she said. She further stated there was “no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’” of the woman at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, adding that authorities carried out checks in accordance with the law.
 






Subsequently, in a statement issued on Tuesday night, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said New Delhi had seen China’s remarks about Thongdok’s “arbitrary detention”.
“Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” Jaiswal said.
 






On the woman’s detention, he said the issue had been taken up strongly with the Chinese authorities, who he said “have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel”.
“The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa-free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,” the spokesperson noted.
Arunachal Pradesh woman’s ‘detention’ amidst attempts to improve ties
The recent row between the two countries, who have been cautiously strengthening ties after four years of hostility, erupted after Thongdok claimed she was held back at the Shanghai airport for 18 hours on November 21.
Thongdok said she was an Indian citizen who had been residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years, and was detained by immigration staff at the Shanghai airport, where she had a layover during her trip from London to Japan.
“They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” she had said on social media platform X on November 23, referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff.
 






She had reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country.
Thongdok said the immigration officials declared her visa unacceptable and “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India. “You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years, where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the two countries were partners, not rivals.
India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.
Ties were ruptured after a 2020 clash in the Himalayas, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261220451704932.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957475/israeli-army-announces-new-operation-in-northern-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli army announces new operation in northern West Bank</strong></a><br><p>The Israeli military on Wednesday announced a new “counterterrorism” operation in the north of the occupied West Bank.
The military and internal security service said in a joint statement that they “began operating as part of a broad counterterrorism operation in the area of northern Samaria”, using the Israeli biblical term for part of the West Bank.
In response to a question from AFP, the Israeli army said the operation was new and not part of its earlier operation launched in January 2025, which, according to Israel, was initiated to counter terrorism. The operation primarily targets Palestinian refugee camps.
Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has soared since the Hamas attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war in October 2023.
It has not ceased despite the fragile truce in effect in Gaza since October 10.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since the start of the onslaught in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures.
At least 44 Israelis, including both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations, according to official Israeli figures.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26103712f375ad5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957468/adb-okays-additional-48m-financing-for-water-project-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>ADB okays additional $48m financing for water project in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved an additional $48 million loan for the Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector Project (BWRDSP), according to a press release issued on Wednesday.
In September, the Central Development Working Party had cleared the Rs49.9bn project for the Zhob and Mula river basins. At the time, participants were told the project would be financed through an ADB loan of $148m (78.99pc), an ADB grant of $5m (2.67pc), and a government contribution of $34.37m (18.34pc).
On Tuesday, the Exe­cutive Committee of the Nat­­i­onal Economic Cou­ncil had approved the project.
In the press release issued today, the ADB said the additional funds would support the completion of critical components of the project, including the Churi Infiltration Gallery subproject, the development of Siri Toi Dam command area, and watershed management activities, adding that work on the components had been “previously delayed due to budgetary constraints”.
“These components are vital for enhancing irrigation efficiency, promoting sustainable water use, and mitigating soil erosion caused by floods,” it said.
The press release further said: “An innovative piped water distribution network will also be introduced in the Siri Toi command area.
“This system promises higher efficiency, reduced conveyance losses, and improved service delivery compared to traditional open-channel systems.”
The ADB projected that once completed, Siri Toi Dam in the Zhob River basin would provide a storage capacity of 36 million cubic metres of water, significantly improving reliable water availability.
“This will ensure efficient and equitable water delivery for domestic and agricultural use across 16,592 hectares of the command area, including 1,839 hectares under khushkaba (rainwater harvesting) farming systems,” the press release said.
It further detailed that “to enhance long-term sustainability, the project incorporates watershed management measures such as afforestation, soil conservation, and the construction of check dams, to reduce land degradation and improve flood management within the dam’s catchment area”.
It further stated that additional financing for BWRDSP was aimed at building on the “project’s earlier successes in strengthening irrigation infrastructure and improving water resource management in Balochistan”.
The press release highlighted that the province faced “severe water scarcity, exacerbated by economic challenges and climate impacts”.
“Agriculture, which forms the backbone of Balochistan’s economy, contributes nearly two-thirds of the province’s economic output and employs 60 per cent of its 13 million residents. However, frequent droughts, water management capacity issues, and climate vulnerabilities have put livelihoods at significant risk, with regional poverty rates nearly twice the national average.”
The press release quoted ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan as saying: “The ongoing project, for which additional financing has been approved, focuses on the Zhob and Mula river basins. This project supports livelihoods and creates improved economic opportunities, particularly for women engaged in agriculture.”
The project is cofinanced by the Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific — funded by the Government of Japan through ADB — and the High Level Technology Fund, the press release said.
It added that the project “aims to establish a climate-resilient and sustainable water resource management system in Balochistan, ensuring long-term benefits for the province”.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26111604b5da20e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957474/professionalism-of-armed-forces-during-marka-i-haq-enhanced-pakistans-global-stature-says-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Professionalism of armed forces during Marka-i-Haq enhanced Pakistan’s global stature, says COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday lauded the “professionalism, resolve and commitment” demonstrated by the armed forces during Marka-i-Haq, stressing that it “enhanced” Pakistan’s global stature.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India, from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, as Marka-i-Haq in May.
The army chief made the remarks while addressing the participants of the National Security Workshop–27 who visited the General Headquarters (GHQ), according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“The professionalism, resolve, and commitment of the armed forces displayed during Marka-i-Haq [have] enhanced the global stature of Pakistan,” the army chief was quoted as saying.
In his remarks, the army chief stressed that Pakistan was a “country of consequence and is destined to reach its rightful place in the comity of nations”.
“Our greatest strength lies in national unity, and together, we shall defeat the nefarious designs of our foes,” the ISPR quoted him as saying.
According to the ISPR, the army chief also highlighted the “fluid regional environment shaped by heightened geopolitical competition, cross-border terrorism, and hybrid threats”.
“He underscored that despite complex challenges, including externally supported militancy and information-centric warfare, Pakistan’s armed forces, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement institutions continue to demonstrate unwavering professionalism and resolve to safeguard national security,” the ISPR said.
COAS Munir also reiterated that the territorial integrity, security, and protection of every Pakistani citizen was “paramount for the Pakistan Army and will not be compromised under any circumstances”.
He also reaffirmed the army’s commitment to supporting federal and provincial governments.
“Coordinated national efforts and institutional synergy are vital for lasting peace, stability, and prosperity,” the ISPR quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile, the ISPR statement said the participants of the workshop were briefed on ongoing national efforts against illegal activities, including the crackdown on smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and organised criminal networks that adversely impact security.
It added that updates were also shared on enhanced border controls and the repatriation of illegal foreigners, aimed at maintaining internal order and protecting national interests.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven.
Following tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.</p><small>2025-11-26 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261055444be17b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957469/taiwan-plans-extra-40-billion-in-defence-spending-to-counter-china' target='_blank'><strong>Taiwan plans extra $40 billion in defence spending to counter China</strong></a><br><p>Taiwan will introduce a $40 billion supplementary defence budget to underscore its determination to defend itself in the face of a rising threat from China, President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday.
Unveiling the T$1.25 trillion ($39.89bn) package, Lai said history had proven that trying to compromise in the face of aggression brought nothing but “enslavement”.
“There is no room for compromise on national security,” he said at a press conference in the presidential office.
“National sovereignty and the core values of freedom and democracy are the very foundation of our nation.”
Lai, who first announced the new spending plan in an op-ed comment in the Washington Post newspaper on Tuesday, said Taiwan was showing its determination to defend itself.
“It is a struggle between defending democratic Taiwan and refusing to submit to becoming ‘China’s Taiwan’,” he added, rather than merely an ideological struggle or a dispute over “unification versus independence”.
China, which views democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, has ramped up military and political pressure over the past five years to assert its claims, which Taipei strongly rejects.
Speaking earlier in Beijing, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said Taiwan was allowing “external forces” to dictate its decisions.
“They squander funds that could be used to improve people’s livelihoods and develop the economy on purchasing weapons and currying favour with external powers,” the spokesperson, Peng Qingen, told reporters. “This will only plunge Taiwan into disaster.”
As Taiwan faces calls from Washington to spend more on its own defence, mirroring US pressure on Europe, Lai said in August he hoped for a boost in defence spending to five per cent of gross domestic product by 2030.
For 2026, the government plans such spending will reach T$949.5bn ($30.3bn), to stand at 3.32pc of GDP, crossing a 3pc threshold for the first time since 2009, government figures showed. Lai had previously flagged extra defence spending, but had not given details.
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties.
But since US President Donald Trump took office in January, it has approved only one new arms sale to Taiwan, a $330-million package for fighter jet and other aircraft parts announced this month.
“The international community is safer today because of the Trump administration’s pursuit of peace through strength,” Lai wrote in The Washington Post</p><small>2025-11-26 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26103411849089a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957299/imrans-sisters-pti-protesters-wrap-up-hours-long-protest-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sisters, PTI protesters wrap up hours-long protest outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI wrapped up its hours-long sit-in against party founder Imran Khan’s sisters being denied a meeting with him outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail late on Tuesday.
The protest, the second in as many weeks, was livestreamed by the party on social media platform X and YouTube.
The protest was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Speaking on the live stream, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said that there was no dialogue with authorities. She said that Nasir had, however, stated that the “focus should be on the martyrs”.
“So he said we should go to their homes … and meet their families. Tomorrow they have called the families of the martyrs in Hayatabad. So we will go there,” she said.
Aleema insisted that the family be allowed to meet Imran, saying: “Who knows, maybe Imran has been shifted. Why are they not letting us meet him?”
In a separate post on X by PTI Islamabad, Aleema said that the protest would be held to express solidarity with the families of those martyred on May 9, October 4 and November 26, all days when the former ruling party had clashed with law enforcement agencies in protests that had turned violent.
 






Noreen Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, also spoke to media and said that the family would continue its efforts to meet the jailed ex-premier.
She said that it was unfortunate that court orders were not being implemented.
Earlier, Islamabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) (Investigations) Rana Tanveer had arrived at the scene to negotiate with Aleema and her sisters to disperse the protesters. However, negotiations between the police and the party supporters had failed, with the PTI adamant on continuing the sit-in.
The PTI livestream showed sloganeering from the crowd gathered outside the jail, with riot police present in the area.
Imran’s sisters Aleema, Noreen and Dr Uzma Khan were initially stopped at Factory Naka by police, upon which PTI supporters started sloganeering and staged a sit-in. At Factory Naka, Aleema had told reporters that she would stay at the sit-in site until she was allowed to meet Imran and questioned the presence of a large number of police personnel.
“At this time, it is the law of the jungle; they (authorities) should be concerned that if they do not proceed according to the constitution and law, Pakistan will face the law of the jungle.”
Aleema also condemned the treatment of her and her sisters last week, calling female police personnel “shameless”.
“These policewomen think that they will make the [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz happy and get promotions by doing this,” she said. “If they want to arrest us, we are not afraid.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh uploaded a video on X showing the party’s Karachi General Secretary Arslan Khalid at the protest.
“The police are doing the same thing again,” he said, referring to the use of force to disperse the protesters.
“Our brothers and sisters are safe and the PTI’s workers are here to protect them,” he added. “Our demand is the release of Imran Khan.”
 






Last week, the party said that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala Jail, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder.</p><small>2025-11-26 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26093219a74fa04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957315/pakistan-is-writing-off-afghan-taliban-with-no-positive-expectations-left-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan is writing off Afghan Taliban, with no positive expectations left: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said Pakistan was writing off the Afghan Taliban and had no further positive expectations from the group, amid consistently tense relations that show no sign of abating.
Earlier today, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, claimed that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. The military spokesperson rejected the allegations.
Asked in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether Pakistan was denying carrying out any strikes or civilian casualties during the alleged strikes, the defence minister replied: “Both things are non-existent at this time. We do react and retaliate, but [targeting] civilians is not at all our manner. We have a disciplined force that has traditions and a code of conduct; we are not a ragtag group like the Taliban, who neither have a code of conduct nor religion nor traditions.”
“But you know, hope should always be present unless all limits are crossed. But today, we are completely writing them off and we have no good hope from them.”
A question about the Taliban’s stated intent to retaliate according to Islamic law irked the defence minister, who asked which Islamic law the Afghan Taliban follow that requires them to live in their neighbour’s home for decades and then spill blood.
“Is this some self-invented Shariah of their own? This is not the Shariah of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).”
When asked about the timing of any retaliation, Asif said Pakistan’s well-wishers, including Turkey, Iran and Qatar, were urging regional peace, arguing it would benefit everyone and create jobs for all, including Afghans.
He added that the Afghan Taliban were more than welcome to pursue and open up trade with India through whichever route they wanted, adding that Pakistan did not care for it.
“All these goods are ultimately sold in our market.”
Pushed for a response on the Taliban’s threat, the defence minister downplayed it as merely words and said it was meaningless to take them seriously or trust them. “There will be no greater idiocy than trusting them,” he added.
Asif maintained that Pakistan had pursued cordial relations, adding that he himself welcomed the Afghan Taliban after they retook Kabul and made frequent visits to Afghanistan, but “I don’t think we have gained any dividends, successes, or changes in their behaviour from these visits; there has been no change in their attitude.”
The defence minister reiterated that the Afghan Taliban were ultimately destroying their own country.
He expressed the belief that the situation would eventually escalate to a point where regional neighbours seeking peace would intervene..
“It won’t take long; otherwise, they will be isolated and their total isolation will ultimately result in a collapse,” he added.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-26 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/260915029f67bec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957444/petition-against-27th-amendment-lands-in-federal-shariat-court' target='_blank'><strong>Petition against 27th Amendment lands in Federal Shariat Court</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A lawyer has invoked the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) against the recently passed 27th Amendment to the Constitution, asking the court to set it aside since the legislation is “repugnant to the injunctions of Islam”.
The petitioner also asked the FSC to declare that the state and its organs were under a continuing obligation to ensure that all laws, constitutional provisions and institutional arrangements remain consonant with the injunctions of Islam as enshrined in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah.
Citing the Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs as respondents, petitioner Barrister Ali Tahir stated in the petition that the impugned amendment has fundamentally altered the balance of power among the country’s institutions and that it has centralised authority in the executive, weakening judicial independence and entrenching military supremacy in constitutional law.
He submitted that Islamic governance was founded on the principles of justice, trust and accountability and the Quran repeatedly commanded the rulers and judges to uphold justice and to be accountable to Allah and the people and that Islamic jurisprudence mandated that the judiciary must be independent from executive and legislative interference.
The petitioner stated that lifetime immunity for the president of the country and military leaders creates a privileged class above the law, violating the Quranic command for equality and accountability and this erodes public trust in institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the state.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s unemployed population surged by a staggering 31 per cent, or 1.4 million, rising from 4.5m in 2020-21 to 5.9m in 2024-25, highlighting mounting challenges in the country’s labour market.
The rise in unemployment was observed across all age groups and both genders over the past four years, indicating a broad-based deterioration in labour market conditions, according to a government report released by Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday.
The unemployment rate also showed an upward trend across all age groups. For the prime age group of 15-24 years, it was estimated at 12.6pc in 2024-25, up from 11.1pc in 2020-21.
Among individuals aged 15-29, the rate rose to 11.5pc from 10.3pc, reflecting growing joblessness among the youth. Overall, the average unemployment rate increased to 6.9pc, compared to 6.3pc in the previous labour force survey.
Among males, the unemployment rate climbed from 5.5pc to 5.9pc, while for females it increased more sharply from 8.9pc to 9.7pc. In rural areas, unemployment rose from 5.8pc to 6.3pc, and in urban areas, it edged up from 7.3pc to 8pc.
 
 

The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) conducted the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2024-25 at the provincial level. This was the 37th round in the series of surveys, with data collected electronically using tablets.
The findings revealed a notable rise in the Labour Force Participation Rate, indicating greater engagement of the working-age population in economic activities. The proportion of people aged 10 and above, who are either employed or actively seeking employment, increased from 44.9pc in 2020-21 to 47.7pc in 2024-25.
A sex-disaggregated analysis showed increases in participation rates for both males and females. Male participation rose from 67.9pc to 69.8pc, while female participation increased from 21.4pc to 24.4pc. Rural participation rose from 48.6pc to 52.3pc, and urban participation from 38.8pc to 40.8pc, reflecting broader workforce inclusion across regions.
The labour force, encompassing all persons aged 10 and above who are employed (including own-use producers) or unemployed, increased from 71.8m in 2020-21 to 85.6m in 2024-25, adding roughly 3.5m people per year.
For the first time, the LFS provides estimates of gig-economy labour supply. For primary jobs, 2.9pc of workers are engaged in gig-based work, while for secondary jobs, gig (short-term) work rises to 10.6pc, with women playing a more prominent role — 15pc of women with secondary jobs rely on gig work, compared to 9.8pc of men.
The share of agricultural employment declined from 37.4pc in 2020-21 to 33.1pc in 2024-25, while the services sector grew from 37.2pc to 41.2pc. Industry’s share declined slightly to 24.9pc from 25.4pc.
The report highlighted robust wage growth, with average monthly wages rising from Rs24,000 to Rs39,000. The gender wage gap fell from Rs4,500 per month in 2020-21 to less than Rs2,000 in 2024-25.
The share of own-account workers increased from 35.5pc to 36.1pc, driven largely by women. Female entrepreneurship rose sharply from 19pc in 2020-21 to 25.2pc, while the share of contributing family workers — predominantly unpaid women — declined from 21.1pc to 19pc, reflecting greater female entry into paid labour.
Out of 179.6m working-age individuals in 2024-25, 117.4m are engaged in unpaid domestic and care activities. Among 92m men, 50.7m (55pc) perform unpaid work, while among 87.6m women, 66.7m (76pc) are engaged in unpaid domestic and care responsibilities.
Employees constitute the largest group (43.5pc), followed by own-account workers (36.1pc), contributing family workers (19.1pc), and employers (1.3pc). Nearly half of female workers are contributing family workers (49.7pc), while almost half of male workers are employees (49pc). Between the two surveys, the share of employees rose from 42pc to 43.5pc, and own-account workers from 35.5pc to 36.1pc, while contributing family workers declined from 21.1pc to 19.1pc, and employers from 1.4pc to 1.3pc.
In non-agricultural work, the informal sector continues to dominate, accounting for 72.1pc of jobs — 75.5pc in rural areas and 68.3pc in urban areas. Formal sector work is more common in cities, reaching 31.7pc.
Female participation is higher in the formal sector at 33.7pc, while male participation in the informal sector reaches 73pc. Formal work has grown slightly over time.

Speaking at a presser along with VBMP leader Hooran Baloch, he said that a few days ago security forces personnel raided a house in Hub Chowki and detained Nasreen Baloch, the daughter of Dilawar and a resident of Tirtaj, before shifting her to an undisclosed location.
 
 

He said the family has not been provided any information about her whereabouts, causing severe distress and mental anguish among family members.
He said the family members of Nasreen Baloch contacted VBMP regarding her enforced disappearance, after which the organisation is now raising the matter to bring it to the notice of higher authorities through the media.
 
 

He said that earlier in May this year, Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan from Basima, was taken into custody from Quetta Civil Hospital and even after six months, she has not been produced in any court of the country and her family has been given no information about her whereabouts.

Police said area people informed the local administration about some suspected activities near the railway track passing through Dera Murad Jamali, which links Balochistan with other parts of the country.
Security personnel, including police officials, immediately rushed to the site along with a bomb disposal squad and started searching the area during which an improvised explosive device was found planted near the railway track.
“The bomb disposal squad immediately defused the IED, weighing around 3.5kg,” Nasirabad SSP Ghulam Sarwar Bhio told Dawn, adding that initial investigation revealed it was a remote-controlled device.
He said the IED was planted to target Quetta-bound passenger train coming from Peshawar.
Just a day earlier, armed men opened fire on the train between Mach and Aab-i-Guam area of Kachhi district. However, the security personnel deployed on the train returned fire, forcing the attackers to escape the area.

In the proper course, a larger bench should hear the matter since the earlier decision was given by a seven-judge SC bench, Advocate Sameer Khosa argued before the FCC bench.
 
 

The bench, headed by Justice Aamer Farooq and comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Muh­a­m­mad Karim Khan Agha, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arsh­ad Huss­ain Shah, had taken up an intra-court appeal (ICA) seeking a declaration that the ordinance amending the Supr­eme Court (Prac­tice and Procedure) Act 2023 was ultra vires the Constitution.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance on Sept 20 last year, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa altered the composition of the three-judge committee under the Act by replacing Justice Munib Akhtar with Justice Aminuddin Khan, now chief justice of the FCC.
The committee filed in the Supreme Court under the now-omitted Article 184(3) of the Constitution. One of the petitioners, Gohar Ali Khan, argued that giving the CJP discretion to nominate any judge to the committee effectively ensured a majority aligned with the CJP.
He termed the ordinance a direct attack on judicial independence and an attempt by the executive to influence fixing of cases in the Supreme Court. He also said the ordinance violated Article 89 of the Constitution, adding that its timing, motivation and manner of issuance were questionable.
 
 

On Tuesday, after the hearing, Justice Aamer Farooq dictated an order issuing notices to the respondents, mainly the president and law ministry, noting that the petitioner had a right to appeal. He said the objections raised by the counsel would be considered when the main plea was heard.
Justice Farooq added that the issue was likely to recur because the Supreme Court Rules, which the FCC had adopted for the time being, state that an appeal should be heard by a larger bench. “We will interpret the points raised by the counsel since the matter may surface again.”
During the hearing, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi asked whether any express bar exists requiring that only a bench larger than the one that issued an earlier decision may hear an appeal against it.
Asked to assist, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman said Article 189 suggests that the FCC is now the superior court and, under Article 175E, all pending SC cases have shifted to the FCC. Therefore, it is for the FCC to determine its procedure and how to fix and hear cases.
He also cited instances where a three-judge SC bench heard appeals against decisions of seven-judge high court benches. But Sameer Khosa argued Section 5 of SC Practice and Procedure Act required a larger bench.
At this, Justice Agha said Section 5 was no longer in the field and the FCC would regulate bench strength.
Justice Farooq observed that a smaller bench could take up a matter and issue notices, but if a decision was to be set aside, a larger bench would be required.
Separately, in a case concerning the appointment of sitting LHC judges as election tribunals under Section 149 of the Elections Act 2017, Sameer Khosa said he had advised his clients, including Salman Akram Raja, to consider engaging other counsel because he had reservations about the FCC’s independence. He sought time for them to decide how to proceed.

The top Iranian security official, who began a two-day visit to Islamabad by holding talks with President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to meet Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik on Wednesday.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
After landing in Islamabad, Mr Larijani told reporters “changing conditions of the region necessitate enhanced cooperation across multiple fields”, while noting Pakistan’s “privileged position” in shaping regional security.

Gaza peace on the table as Larijani discusses regional, global issues with civilian leadership; will meet army, intel chiefs today

The trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, now moving into its implementation phase after being adopted by the UN Security Council on Nov 17. The initiative includes an international stabilisation force for Gaza, a move Tehran fears could entrench foreign military involvement. Pakistan has supported the plan and is seen as a potential contributor to the force.
Though the various statements on the top security council official’s meetings by the Pakistani side didn’t say much on discussions about Gaza peace plan, the Iranian official in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed greetings of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel and said it showed the “firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people”.
 






In what many saw a possible balance act, Mr Larijani in the same post on X said, “We extend our gratitude to the government, the parliament, and the armed forces of Pakistan.”
The PM Office said Shehbaz Sharif and Mr Larijani exchanged views on major regional and international developments and “stressed the importance of coordinated efforts to promote peace and stability.”
 






The premier expressed appreciation for Iran’s engagement, while the Iranian official thanked Pakistan for its role in advocating dialogue and diplomacy for peaceful settlement of disputes, possibly a reference to Islamabad’s role of a messenger between Tehran and Washington.
The two sides agreed that a delegation led by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would soon visit Tehran to advance cooperation, particularly in agriculture and connectivity.
The Foreign Office said Mr Dar and Mr Larijani reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and expanding cooperation on regional and international issues.
 






In comments to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, the deputy premier said he held “detailed and frank discussions” with Mr Larijani, adding he was “very pleased” with the visit. The security official told IRNA the talks covered economic progress, ways to expand cooperation, and regional and international developments.
During his call on President Zardari, cooperation in energy, commerce and railways were discussed.
 






 
 

The president underscored Pakistan’s desire to boost trade with Iran and pressed for strengthening the rail link to facilitate commerce and travel, especially for religious pilgrims. He emphasised the need for a “mutually workable solution” on the stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, citing Pakistan’s growing energy needs, and welcomed technical discussions held recently in Islamabad.
Mr Larijani said directives issued after the Iranian President Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan in August including for preferential access for Pakistani products had set the path toward achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target.
Mr Larijani also met NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq at Parliament House, where they discussed parliamentary cooperation, regional security and opportunities for expanded economic engagement.
 






His trip follows a visit by Iranian parliament speaker Bagher Ghalibaf last month, marking the second senior Iranian delegation to Islamabad in weeks and underscoring intensified diplomatic activity between the neighbors amid shifting regional dynamics.
Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul as cross-border tensions are rising.

“Despite some improvement in the last two years, Pakistan has consistently struggled with weak budget credibility, which has generated several macro-critical governance weaknesses … there are a number of shortcomings in public investment management resulting in failure to protect funding for approved projects over the project life cycle and major project delays and cost increases in projects”, said the IMF in its Governance and Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA).
It demanded immediate steps, within three to six months, to enhance cash management by implementing the overarching sectorisation exercise to unify decision-making around TSA institutional coverage, while also improving analytical capabilities and adopting a forward-looking approach to cash forecasting.

Calls for immediate steps to combat corruption and inefficiencies

It said the situation was compounded by a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision that undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances. “The current set-up in debt management involves multiple entities with overlapping roles and responsibilities, which complicates decision-making and coordination”, it said, elaborating that mechanisms for monitoring and accountability were weak, including in the management of financial and non-financial assets, and state-owned enterprises. “Institutions that use budgetary resources but are designed to operate outside of standard fiscal accountability constraints undermine other state institutions and increase corruption risks”, it said.
Moreover, fiscal and economic governance vulnerabilities reflect a persistent gap between formal policy and actual practice, creating space for the misuse of public authority for private gain. Parliamentary oversight of spending is weakened by substantial differences between approved budgets and actual expenditures. For example, the National Assembly approved Rs9.4 trillion in expenditure overruns in 2024-25, five times higher than the previous year.
On top of that, constituency development funds under the direct control of legislators further skew capital investments and complicate oversight. “Current arrangements for cash management, debt management, and the management of state financial and non-financial assets remain insufficient, providing officials with substantial discretion”.
The fund noted that a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances, leading to inefficiencies in the use of public funds and weakening overall budget authority. Without centralised oversight, fragmented cash holdings across various accounts can result in idle balances that are not optimally utilised for government priorities.
“Moreover, the lack of transparency raises concerns about potential foregone interest revenue for the federal budget. It remains unclear who benefits from the interest earned on accounts held by federal government entities in commercial banks, and whether such earnings are captured in the national budget”, said the IMF and emphasised that addressing these gaps was essential to strengthen fiscal discipline, reduce corruption vulnerabilities, and enhance the efficiency of public financial management.
It acknowledged that the MoF had set up the institutional framework for cash and debt management, but the implementation of the framework has been weak in practice. It said the legal changes over the years required a high-level Cash Coordination Committee (CCC) and a Cash Forecasting Unit (CFU) at the MoF to consolidate external commercial borrowing and domestic wholesale borrowing functions. The CFU was currently not operational as it was not staffed, and CCC met on an ad-hoc basis with long intervals rather than monthly as intended, and did not align with the principle that it should be systematically assessing cash forecasts and reviewing the cash buffer policy, constraining the effective borrowing programme.
Pointing to weak budget controls, the IMF said that several stages of the expenditure process were carried out manually and are not presently captured in the Financial Accounting and Budgeting System, presenting governance vulnerabilities in budget execution.

In a written reply submitted to the court, the superintendent said the PTI founder is under strict surveillance and has no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.
He said mobile signal jammers have been installed inside the jail and in surrounding areas, making the use of mobile phones or internet facilities “impossible for any inmate”.
He added that Mr Khan is barred under jail rules from engaging in political discussions, though some visitors allegedly violate these restrictions by initiating political conversations during meetings.
The superintendent also recalled that political instructions attributed to the former premier had previously contributed to social unrest, but insisted that no such communication is now possible as Mr Khan lacks access to any mobile or internet-enabled device.
The superintendent stressed that the X account associated with the PTI founder “is not being operated from the jail” and that its activity “is clearly being managed from outside”.
He said the prisoner receives only routine facilities allowed under jail rules or ordered by the court, none of which include any digital or online communication privileges.
The statement came in response to a petition filed by a citizen, Ghulam Murtaza, through Barrister Zafarullah, alleging that Mr Khan is issuing “illegal and provocative messages” from his X account despite being incarcerated.
Bail extended
Meanwhile, a district and sessions court in Islamabad extended the pre-arrest bail of Mr Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, until Dec 23 in multiple cases, including those related to the May 9 violent protests. The court also stayed their arrest in the various cases.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka presided over the hearing. Due to the PTI founder’s unavailability, arguments on his bail applications could not be presented. The judge directed that he be produced either in person or via video link at the next hearing.
The proceedings were adjourned until Dec 23.

During a meeting of the Senate’s standing committee on interior, Senators Aslam Abro, Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan complained that they had been receiving life threats but none of them had been provided security.
Senator Shahadat Awan, who chaired the meeting, directed that until the provincial threat assessment committees take up the matter, IG Islamabad, IG Sindh, and IG Balochistan must provide security to the three senators. 
Senator Saifullah Abro questioned the integrity of certain FIA officials, noting that an FIA officer had made billions of rupees property in a single year.
Members suggested formation of a sub-committee for identification of those involved, but the chairman of the committee said there was no need for a sub-committee at this stage and directed that the investigation report against the responsible FIA officers be completed at the earliest and submitted to the committee. 
The committee was also given a compliance report from Additional IG Sindh and representatives of IG Balochistan regarding arrest of the accused involved in the murder of Senator Muhammad Aslam Abro’s brother and nephew.
The Additional IG of Sindh informed the house that police teams are currently in Quetta pursuing the suspects; property confiscation proceedings have begun; the identity cards of the accused have been blocked; and the bank accounts of the accused have been frozen. 
He said that call data records of only two suspects have been traced.
