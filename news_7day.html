Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Divisional Superintendent Noorduddin Dawar confirmed to Dawn that the Millat Express struck a police vehicle belonging to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that suddenly tried to cross the track at an unmanned crossing, leaving two constables dead and one injured. He added that two other constables were “safe”.
“SHO (Station House Officer) RPS (railway police station) Sargodha and SHO Cantt Sargodha Punjab Police are present at the site,” he said in a message to Dawn. “This falls under the jurisdiction of Sargodha Cantt District Police. The train has moved after a brief stop.”
Muhammad Sawar Khan, an area officer for Pakistan Railways, confirmed to Dawn that the train — which left Sargodha and headed towards Charnali railway station —was running through the unmanned crossing when a police van belonging to the SIU attempted to cross.
“The driver of the police van tried to cross the unmanned crossing without looking and was hit by the train. Two police constables died in the collision and three were injured, one of whom is in critical condition,” Khan elaborated.
The two deceased cops were identified as Constables Sibtain and Amanullah, while the other three were identified as Head Constable Muhammad Owais, Constable Abrar and Driver Constable Ziafat, according to Rescue 1122 Sargodha.
Visuals of the vehicle showed that the front end of the vehicle had been completely mangled in the collision.
According to the police, the five personnel were performing a routine patrol of the area when they attempted to cross the railway track.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took immediate notice of the incident and demanded a report from the deputy inspector general of the SIU.
Meanwhile, a Punjab Police spokesperson said that the incident was being investigated and legal action would be taken.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15221945d5b0e4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961284/cop-civilian-martyred-as-terrorists-raid-bank-in-balochistans-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>Cop, civilian martyred as terrorists raid bank in Balochistan’s Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>A policeman and a civilian were martyred when terrorists attacked and looted a bank in Balochistan’s Panjgur area, according to police officials.
According to police sources, a clash erupted when terrorists attempted to raid a private bank in Panjgur city and police responded, triggering a gun battle.
Dara Khan, a constable with the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), was martyred, while another civilian was killed. A source added that two policemen were also injured in the gun battle, while the suspects fled the scene.
AFP, citing a police official, reported that Rs1 million had been stolen.
Panjgur SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Dost Muhammad Bugti told the media that the suspects arrived in four vehicles and that two bank raids were foiled after police responded.
“If police had not responded, then all five banks in the city would have been robbed,” he said.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti issued a statement praising the response by the police and CTD, lauding them for ensuring the “safety of the lives and property of the people with extraordinary bravery and professionalism”.
“I salute the courage, sense of duty and great sacrifice of martyred CTD constable Dara Khan during the operation,” CM Bugti was quoted as saying. “The sacrifices of brave sons like shaheed (martyred) Dara Khan will never be forgotten. The nation is indebted to the blood of these great martyrs.”
The Balochistan CM added that there is no place for criminals or terrorists in the province and vowed that the state would forcefully pursue anti-national elements.
“The sacrifices of the security forces for the establishment of law and order will never go in vain,” CM Bugti vowed.
On November 30, security forces killed at least three terrorists in retaliatory action after one of the attackers blew himself up at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Balochistan’s Nokkundi, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson for FC Balochistan South.
Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terror activities, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, it had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-12-15 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15194654cc612c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961280/atc-lahore-hands-35-year-imprisonment-to-banned-tlp-leader-for-inciting-violence-against-chief-justice' target='_blank'><strong>ATC Lahore hands 35-year imprisonment to banned TLP leader for inciting violence against chief justice</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced on Monday Zaheerul Hassan Shah, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), to 35 years in prison for inciting the public against the then chief justice of Pakistan.
At one of the gatherings outside the Lahore Press Club, where TLP chief Saad Rizvi was also in attendance, Shah delivered remarks amounting to incitement of violence against then Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.
Qila Gujjar Singh police had registered the case against the cleric in 2024, pertaining to his speech for inciting violence against the top judge of the Supreme Court for issuing the judgment in the Mubarak Sani case.
The FIR, filed on the complaint of Station House Officer Hammad Hussain, was registered under sections 6 (terrorism), 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism), and 11W (printing, publishing, or disseminating any material to incite hatred or giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed organisation or an organisation placed under observation) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict and handed over the custody of the convict to the superintendent of the central jail Kot Lakhpat.
During the trial, the prosecution presented 15 witnesses in support of the charges against the cleric. Deputy Prosecutor Abdul Jabbar Dogar sought punishment for the accused under the law.
On behalf of the cleric, Advocate Rana Maqsoodul Haq presented final arguments, urging the court to acquit his client.
However, the defence counsel did not fully deny the veracity of the allegations.
The judge awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to the accused under section 7(1)(b), five-year imprisonment each under sections 7(g), 21(L) and 11 (w) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The judge also awarded the accused separate jail terms of seven years, three years, and six months under Sections 505, 117, and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
A collective fine of Rs600,000 was also imposed on the party leader under the provisions of the ATA.
Several FIRs were also registered against the TLP leaders and workers in different cities after Shah had issued a call for violence against Chief Justice Isa.
Strong condemnation surfaced from political circles and clerics after the incident.
Pakistani government officials vowed to take strict action against “those spreading lies,” stating that elements with “vested political interests” were “spreading blood and violence” in the name of religion.
The defence minister said that the Supreme Court had issued a judgment in the Mubarak Sani case, but the elements concerned were still spreading propaganda based on lies.
“The state will not allow you to issue a fatwa (decree) to kill someone. If we allow this, the writ of the state will crumble,” Asif had said.
Information Minister Atta Tarar had asserted that there was “no space in our society” for such inciting remarks, adding that there were “political motives” behind them. He further highlighted that a case under the anti-terrorism laws had been registered.
He also called out the religio-political group for issuing “politically motivated false statements” against the top judge and said that there was no room for such rhetoric in Pakistan.
“There is no room for such statements in the State of Pakistan, and it will not be tolerated,” Tarar said on the X platform.







The federal cabinet banned the religio-political group TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in October, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It had also faced a ban by the Imran Khan-led government in 2021 after violent protests.</p><small>2025-12-15 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15204917f56c330.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961272/un-at-a-crossroads-time-for-a-woman-or-muslim-secretary-general' target='_blank'><strong>UN at a crossroads: Time for a woman — or Muslim — secretary-general</strong></a><br><p>As the United Nations prepares to select its tenth secretary-general, global attention is focused not only on which candidate will succeed António Guterres in January 2027, but on what the choice will signal about the institution’s relevance, priorities, and ability to respond to mounting global crises.
On November 25, 2025, the presidents of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council jointly invited all 193 member states to nominate candidates for the post. In a noteworthy departure from past practice, their letter expressly encourages member states to nominate a woman while also underscoring the importance of regional diversity.
“Noting with regret that no woman has ever held the position of secretary‑general, and convinced of the need to guarantee equal opportunities for women and men in gaining access to senior decision‑making positions, Member States are encouraged to strongly consider nominating women as candidates,“ they wrote.
All nine individuals who have previously led the United Nations in its 80‑year history have been men, a fact that critics and diplomats alike increasingly view as a glaring symbol of gender inequality at the highest level of global diplomacy.
A historic moment for gender equality
Calls for a woman to lead the United Nations have grown louder in 2025, with voices from capitals worldwide urging a break from an unbroken tradition that has excluded women from the organisation’s most powerful seat.
At the 80th UN General Assembly, numerous leaders spoke out. Estonia’s President Alar Karis said it was “high time for a woman to be chosen as UN secretary‑general,” explicitly linking gender equality to broader efforts to strengthen the organisation. Slovenia’s President Nataša Pirc Musar echoed this, declaring: “By the end of this session, she should be joined by a madam secretary‑general‑elect.”
Rebeca Grynspan, who was formally nominated by Costa Rica in October 2025, has strongly embraced this narrative. In an interview with Reuters, she said, “We don’t need special treatment. What we are really asking for is no discrimination… equal treatment. If equality will prevail, we will be able to get there.”

Grynspan’s emphasis on equal treatment underscores the subtle shift in diplomatic rhetoric: many states are advocating not just for a woman SG, but for a selection that reflects merit, inclusivity, and diversity, challenging traditional power dynamics within the United Nations.

Civil society organisations and advocacy coalitions such as 1 for 8 Billion and the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders note that dozens of countries have in recent months pressed the UN to consider gender balance in its leadership, with indirect or direct references to the need for the next secretary‑general to be a woman.
Beyond gender: Gaza, credibility, and trust
The push for the first woman secretary‑general is not happening in isolation. The United Nations’ credibility has been intensely debated over its response to the Gaza crisis, where humanitarian needs remain severe and civilian suffering has persisted despite repeated appeals from UN agencies for humanitarian access and protection.
Leaders at the 80th General Assembly condemned the violence and urged action. Jordan’s King Abdullah II described what is happening in Gaza as “one of the darkest moments in the history of the organisation,” questioning the effectiveness of repeated UN statements without tangible protection mechanisms. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan went further, accusing global institutions of failing to safeguard civilians.
This sense of institutional frustration factors into discussions about the next secretary‑general. Many diplomats and analysts believe that gender representation — particularly candidate models associated with empathy, inclusivity, and a focus on humanitarian issues — could be positively correlated with public trust in a UN perceived to be lagging in crisis leadership.
The power dynamics: US, China, Russia and the Security Council veto
Despite mounting support for a woman leader and the broader narrative of inclusion, the realpolitik of the Security Council will likely determine the final outcome. Under Article 97 of the UN Charter, the secretary‑general is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council, where the five permanent members (P5) — the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France — hold veto power.
In October 2025, the United States made its position clear. Deputy US Ambassador Dorothy Shea told the Security Council that the next leader should be chosen in a “purely merit‑based” process with as wide a pool of candidates as possible and that nominees should come from all regional groupings. “The next secretary‑general should bring the UN back to basics… help achieve the bold vision of peace and prosperity” envisioned by the founders, Shea said, invoking former secretary‑general Dag Hammarskjöld’s mission to save humanity from “hell.”
This statement reflects a broader trend in US policy under the Trump administration, which has sought to shape the UN’s leadership while also pressing for institutional reforms.
Washington’s position on this issue increasingly frames the contest in terms of US-desired institutional reforms and alignment with US priorities, even as it acknowledges the momentum behind gender equality.
It’s a known fact that the United States wields considerable influence, but it’s also obvious that China and Russia could veto a candidate seen as advancing US-centric policies.
Russia’s Ambassador to the UN., Vassily Nebenzia, has made the country’s perspective clear: gender is one of many factors, but “merit comes before gender,” and the customary practice of regional rotation should not be dismissed — a point underplayed in Washington.

China, long cautious about overt commentary on gender in high‑level UN politics, has recently signalled that it “would also be pleased to see female candidates presented by Member States.“

But like Moscow, Beijing, too, wants to retain regional rotation while choosing the next secretary-general.
This matters because, despite growing public calls for gender balance, the permanent members wield effective vetoes at the Security Council stage, meaning any candidate must be acceptable to all five for the process to move forward.
Regional rotation and the Latin America factor
Another layer of complexity involves the informal but powerful norm of regional rotation, which has shaped past secretary‑general selections despite not being mandated by the UN Charter. When António Guterres of Portugal was appointed in 2016, Latin America and the Caribbean were widely expected to be next under the customary cycle. The formal start of the nomination period in late 2025 came with renewed emphasis on this unwritten practice.
Latin American leaders have been outspoken about this. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric, while endorsing Michelle Bachelet, framed it as “Latin America’s moment” — not just geographically, but as a region ready to offer leadership on peace, climate justice, and sustainable development.
Costa Rica’s nomination of Rebeca Grynspan, a candidate with a long record in development and multilateral leadership, further reflects this regional push and the broader narrative that the next UN leader should reflect both geographic and gender diversity.
Institutional renewal or geopolitical compromise?
Analysts note that much depends on how member states balance gender advocacy with larger geopolitical interests. A strong push for a woman secretary‑general could unify a majority of member states; research shows that at least 94 countries have recently expressed some form of concern about gender imbalance in the UN’s top ranks, ranging from indirect support to strong advocacy for a woman leader.
But without consensus from the Security Council’s permanent members, even broad General Assembly support may not be enough to secure a nomination. For emerging candidates — particularly women and those from the Global South — navigating the interests and red lines of the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France will be pivotal.
Why this moment matters
As the nomination process moves into 2026, formal candidacies will be wired to the Security Council, and a series of secret straw polls will begin. These will reveal preference patterns and potential vetoes well before the General Assembly’s final vote later in the year. At stake is not just another leadership transition, but a measure of whether the United Nations can evolve in a world where dozens of crises — from Gaza to Ukraine to climate change — challenge its capacity to act effectively.

Another possibility, although not very visible, is selecting a Muslim woman. It would be historic and would represent not just a symbolic break with decades of male leadership, but a broader acknowledgement of the changing face of global diplomacy.

It would also send a strong signal to millions around the world — especially in societies where gender inequality persists — that the world’s most universal institution is committed to reflecting the diversity of its membership in its highest office.
Muslim Women in the UN: A Possible Path
While no Muslim woman is currently an official candidate, several senior Muslim women hold influential roles within the UN system — showing that such a candidacy is possible under UN rules:
Amina J. Mohammed (Nigeria/UK) — Deputy Secretary‑General, the second‑highest position in the Secretariat.
Nihal Saad (Egypt) — Director of the UN Alliance of Civilizations.
Maimunah Mohd Sharif (Malaysia) — Former head of UN‑Habitat and an Under‑Secretary‑General.
These leaders embody the capacity for both gender and religious diversity at senior UN levels, even if none has yet entered the secretary‑general race.
The process is inevitably shaped by power, politics, and compromise. The United States’ strategic vision, Russia’s emphasis on merit and regional rotation, China’s newly expressed openness, and the fact that all permanent members wield veto power mean that the outcome is far from certain — even if a woman is now the most probable choice.
What is clear, however, is that this race is not simply about filling a leadership position: it is about what kind of United Nations the world wants at a time of profound global challenge.

The development comes after the Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.
Under the bill, flying kites with metallic wires, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials is prohibited, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
Violators involved in kite-flying could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5m.
All offences under the proposed law will be cognisable and non-bailable.
The bill empowers deputy commissioners to allow “permissible kite-flying” on specific days and at designated locations, subject to government approval and strict conditions. However, the use of sharp or metallic strings will remain banned under all circumstances.
Special provisions are included in the bill that deal with children involved in kite-flying. Minors will be tried under the Juvenile Justice System Act and be fined Rs50,000 for the first offence and Rs100,000 for repeat violations, with parents or guardians held financially responsible in case of default.
The proposed law also introduces the mandatory registration of kite manufacturers, traders and sellers of permissible kite-flying material, as well as kite-flying associations. Police officers not below the rank of sub-inspector will be empowered to arrest offenders without a warrant, conduct searches and seize illegal materials.
To encourage enforcement, the bill includes a whistleblower reward of up to Rs5,000 for providing credible information about violations.
If passed by the provincial assembly, the new law will repeal earlier kite-flying ordinances and establish a uniform, province-wide regulatory framework aimed at protecting lives and public safety.
Kite-flying, particularly in Punjab, has been outlawed due to severe and sometimes fatal accidents.
Last July, a 13-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Kasur’s Basti Lal Shah area.
The boy rushed to catch a stray kite attached to a metal string. The metal string fell on the transmission line before he caught it.
In March last year, a motorcyclist died after a metal string, believed to be part of a stray kite, cut his throat in Faisalabad. Following the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a crackdown on those involved in kite-flying.
The provincial government intensified its crackdown on kite-flying by declaring kite-making, flying, and transportation as non-bailable offences in August 2024.</p><small>2025-12-15 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15192347070a96c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961278/hero-who-disarmed-bondi-gunman-recovers-in-hospital-as-donations-pour-in' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hero’ who disarmed Bondi gunman recovers in hospital as donations pour in</strong></a><br><p>Donations for a Sydney man who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during a mass shooting at Bondi Beach have surged past Australian dollars (A$)1.1 million ($744,000), as he recovers in hospital after surgery for bullet wounds.
Forty-three-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, a father-of-two, hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ahmed’s bravery saved lives.
“What we’ve seen in the last 24 hours was the worst of humanity in a terrorist act. But we also saw an example of the best of humanity in Ahmed Al Ahmed running towards danger, putting his own life at risk,” Albanese told state broadcaster ABC News.
He was shot twice by a second perpetrator, Albanese said. Ahmed’s family said he was hit in the hand and arm.
Australian police on Monday said a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
Hailed a hero for disarming the gunman
Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, told ABC News in an interview that his son was an Australian citizen and sells fruits and vegetables.
“My son is a hero. He served in the police; he has the passion to defend people. When he saw people lying on the ground and the blood, quickly his conscience pushed him to attack one of the terrorists and take away his weapon,” Mohamed Fateh said.
Jozay Alkanji, Ahmed’s cousin, said he had had initial surgery and may need more.

Tributes have poured in from leaders both abroad and at home.Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales where Sydney is located, said in a social media post that he visited Ahmed at St George Hospital and conveyed the gratitude of people across the state.
“Ahmed is a real-life hero,” his post said. “Thank you, Ahmed.” A photo showed Minns at his bedside, and Ahmed propped on pillows with his left arm in a cast.







US President Donald Trump called Ahmed “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.1 million within one day. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was the largest donor, contributing A$99,999 and sharing the fundraiser on his X account.
Supporters thank Ahmed for saving lives
Outside St George Hospital, strangers came to show their support.
Misha and Veronica Pochuev left flowers for Ahmed with their seven-year-old daughter, Miroslava.
“My husband is Russian, my father is Jewish, my grandpa is Muslim. This is not only about Bondi, this is about every person,” Veronica said.
Yomna Touni, 43, stayed at the hospital for hours to offer assistance on behalf of a Muslim-run charity also raising funds for Ahmed.
“The intention is to raise as much money as possible for his speedy recovery,” she said.</p><small>2025-12-15 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1518425084e7046.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961274/pti-hires-foreign-companies-to-run-selective-narratives-propaganda-on-social-media-tallal-chaudhry' target='_blank'><strong>PTI hires foreign companies to run selective narratives, propaganda on social media: Tallal Chaudhry</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Monday said the PTI hired “foreign companies” to run paid hashtags and social media trends to disseminate “selective narratives and propaganda”.
“The companies create fake accounts in the name of women and news agencies that are being operated from foreign countries,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad.
Chaudhry also showed a video, saying all evidence in the video was taken from “documents provided by X” (formerly Twitter).
Briefing on the entire mechanism of the operation, he said, “The companies were hired through auction and paid via foreign funding [by PTI]. These companies then create social media accounts, which are mostly operated outside Pakistan in countries that are considered our enemies. The account users [handlers who operate the accounts] are neither PTI members nor people from Pakistan.”
The accounts were owned by companies that “frequently change the accounts’ names as per the requirements,” he added.
He added that a company made a WhatsApp group to share instructions for a trend and then deleted it to prevent the instructions from being traced to various accounts operated in different countries. “The amount of money given for a trend or a tweet can’t be traced,” he said.
Later, the company created a new WhatsApp group, and new people were added for the task.
“The accounts retweet a message from 50 to 500 times, while the value of a tweet can be Rs50, Rs100, 10 cents or 2 cents,” he added.
“The accounts which make trends [for PTI] also create trends about the activities of TTP, BLA, and pro-Israel groups.”
He added that the social media platforms had taken action against some accounts as they were against their policies and guidelines.
“We have a lot of information about the people who are involved in it, but we don’t want to initiate criminal cases or legal proceedings against them. We are cautioning them not to be part of trends that are against the country for monetary gains.”
Responding to a question about the amount and source of investment, he said, “The payment is made in dollars and is transferred through [PTI’s] foreign funding. According to our analysis, Pakistanis are rarely involved in these trends.”
In response to another question about contacting PTI on the matter, the minister said, “No one wants to own it. They say it [the trends and hashtags] is organic and [real] people participate in it.”
However, he said, “We have provided evidence that real people don’t participate in it.”
On a question about action against the companies and social media accounts, he said, “Most of the accounts are fake. Real accounts are rarely involved in it. Social media platforms don’t provide IP addresses of the accounts due to privacy laws, nor do they provide details of account holders.”
He further said that the government had taken the social media platforms “on board” to take action against the accounts and would “try to write to the countries from which these accounts have been operated.”
Chaudhry referenced other countries, saying, “These conditions prevail across the world. Some countries in Europe ban or block social media platforms to protect their interests.”</p><small>2025-12-15 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15185101197d067.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961275/punjab-to-field-new-riot-control-force-for-unlawful-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab to field new riot control force for ‘unlawful’ protests</strong></a><br><p>Punjab is set to raise a separate force for handling “unlawful” protests and mobs, as the Punjab Assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on Monday cleared a sweeping amendment to the Police Order, 2002, to tighten control over riots, violent protests and unlawful assemblies across the province.
The proposed Police Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2025, introduces a dedicated Riot Management Unit (RMU), empowered to manage riots across Punjab with modern gear and training specifically for crowd control.
The RMU will operate under an additional inspector general of police (AIG), supervised by the provincial police officer.
A key feature of the bill is the formal declaration of “riot zones.” Under the new law, the deputy commissioner and district police officer can jointly declare any affected area a riot zone, allowing authorities to cordon off roads, evacuate civilians and appoint an incident commander to coordinate all departments during operations.
The bill grants legal protection to police and RMU personnel for actions taken “in good faith” during riot control, shielding them from lawsuits and prosecutions for lawful use of force.
To strengthen accountability, the amendment makes organisers, instigators and facilitators of riots financially liable. Courts will be required to order compensation for deaths, injuries, mental trauma and property damage caused during riots or unlawful assemblies.
Compensation will be recoverable as arrears of land revenue, with up to three years’ imprisonment for default.
A new chapter, ‘Offences in the Riot Zone’, prescribes up to 10 years’ imprisonment and fines up to Rs500,000 for attacks on police, law enforcement personnel or private individuals, as well as for damage to public or private property.
Such offences will be cognisable, non-bailable and tried by sessions courts on a day-to-day basis, with a mandatory decision within 30 days.
The bill also bars accused persons from transferring property once a case is registered and restricts foreign travel without court permission. The use of modern surveillance technology, including Safe City cameras, is allowed, with video and photographic evidence declared admissible in court.
According to the statement of objects, the amendments seek to address rising public unrest, violent protests and attacks on law enforcement, while ensuring compensation for victims and clearer legal cover for police action.
The bill will now move to the Punjab Assembly floor for enactment.
This development comes several months after the religio-political party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had begun a protest march in Lahore, which turned violent.
The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in multiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi.
The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of October 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on October 13 that resulted in their dispersal.
Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road.
Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging.
On October 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation.
Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
In the wake of the violence, the federal government banned the TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act on October 24, after receiving a recommendation from the Punjab government to place them on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA — a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism.</p><small>2025-12-15 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151818152283265.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961273/mqm-p-proposes-disbursing-local-bodies-share-through-nfc-as-provinces-fail-to-transfer-funds-to-districts' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P proposes disbursing local bodies’ share through NFC as provinces fail to transfer funds to districts</strong></a><br><p>Federal Health Minister and Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal shared key features of his party’s draft constitutional amendment, proposing the disbursement of districts’ shares through the National Finance Commission (NFC) as the provinces failed to transfer funds to local bodies.
He was addressing a gathering held at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Monday.
Kamal said regional autonomy comes when all stakeholders are empowered and autonomous decision-making powers are devolved from the chief minister to union council chairmen.
He said that there is a mechanism for disbursing funds from the federal government to the provinces, but no mechanism for transferring funds from provinces to local bodies.
“It’s up to a person’s will to either grant Rs1,000 billion to someone or to grant nothing to another.”
He highlighted that Article 140a of the Constitution stressed the devolution of political, administrative, and financial powers to elected local representatives.
“Every CM interprets this according to his own will,” the health minister said.
MQM-P leader said, “Our party held deliberations and drafted a constitutional amendment to propose some structural reforms in the NFC divisible pool.”
Kamal maintained that the constitutional amendment draft prepared by his party proposed disbursing the shares of districts and local bodies through the same mechanism used to transfer federal funds to the provinces.
“We want to add the districts in the central divisible pool of the NFC as the provinces are, so the local bodies may get their shares directly from federal government without the intervention of provinces.”
The former mayor of Karachi lamented that his tenure as the mayor ended in 2010; however, the local bodies election held in 2015 was held on the orders of the Supreme Court.
He criticised the then-provincial government for running the affairs of a metropolitan city through a government-appointed administrator rather than a people-elected mayor.
“Can you imagine cities like New York or Shanghai even running for five days without a mayor?” he boasted.
The minister said Karachi was among the 12 rapidly developing cities when he was the mayor.
“I feel saddened by the current situation of this city, as Karachi has now become one of the four worst cities to live in.”
Kamal said, “I have said multiple times on the floor of the parliament that the IMF cannot lift our country from this economic quagmire, but Karachi can.”
“There are two operational seaports in Pakistan, which serve as the economic gateway; both are situated in Karachi, but sadly, this city doesn’t have quality drinking water,” he grieved.
“The tanker mafia steals our city’s water to sell to us because powerful circles are backing them.”
He added that the country’s external enemies cannot harm us; the real threat comes from enemies within.
Kamal also responded to critics of his party for being in government but unable to deliver.
“These ministries that we have are not a benediction bestowed upon us; I handle them with utmost care,” he said.
He added that his party is here to utilise whatever space remains to deliver results.
“We voice our concerns at all the relevant platforms; authorities listen to us, acknowledge our concerns; however, we need an immediate fix.”
“No one ignores the potential of Karachi, no one says that we don’t want to fix the issues of this city, but when will this fixation begin? No one knows.”
He retorted to his political opponents, “We are not in power in this city nor in this province. Those who have been in power could have sidelined us from politics through their performance, but why do people still remember what Mustafa Kamal did?”
“We have never extended our hands in front of anyone for any favour; we want to fix the system through the constitution.”
The federal minister deplored the structural gaps in the system. He said that he feels helpless against the system of this country, as even the transfers and postings in his own ministry are approved by the cabinet.
“It’s already too late. I am scared of reaching the point of no return.”</p><small>2025-12-15 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151456016e17c0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961265/central-bank-slashes-policy-rate-by-50-bps-to-105pc' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank slashes policy rate by 50 bps to 10.5pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.5 per cent, effective from December 16.
In a statement, the monetary policy committee (MPC) noted that inflation remained within the 5-7pc target range on average during July-November FY26, though it said that core inflation proved to be “relatively sticky”.
“On balance, the inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged, mainly owing to the relatively benign global commodity prices and anchored inflation expectations, amidst [a] prudent monetary policy stance,” the statement read.
The MPC further observed that economic activity was increasing based on an improvement in key high-frequency indicators, including a higher-than-anticipated increase in large-scale manufacturing during the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year.







“Nonetheless, the committee noted that the global environment remains challenging, particularly for exports, which may have some implications for the macroeconomic outlook,” the statement read.
“In this backdrop, while ensuring the ongoing price stability, the MPC noted the available space to reduce the policy rate to support sustainable economic growth.”
Additionally, the committee observed some developments since its last meeting in May, namely a rising unemployment rate from 2020-21, increasing foreign exchange reserves and “sizeable” debt repayments and increasing consumer confidence. It did note that business confidence “moderated slightly”.
“Led by sizable SBP profit transfer, the overall and primary fiscal balances recorded surpluses during Q1-FY26,” the statement read. “The global environment remains fluid, characterised by generally supportive commodity prices, but also evolving tariff-related dynamics and challenging financial conditions.”
The MPC added that high-frequency indicators support previous assessments of ongoing momentum in sectors, such as large-scale manufacturing. It further noted that the sale of automobiles, fertiliser, cement and the imports of machinery and intermediate goods, “all signal a positive outlook for industrial activity”.
On the other hand, the committee said that the ongoing challenging export environment poses some risks for industrial outlook.
“In the agriculture sector, incoming information about major crops also support the previous assessment,” the statement read. “The latest information on area under wheat crop, input conditions and government-backed incentive schemes indicates that wheat production may surpass the target.”
The MPC stated that these positive developments are likely to support the services sector and real GDP growth for FY26 is expected to remain in the upper half of the earlier projected range of 3.25–4.25pc.
In terms of the external sector, the MPC said that the current account posted a cumulative deficit of $0.7 billion during July-October FY26, in line with its expectations. Imports continued to grow with improving economic activity and workers’ remittances remained resilient.
“However, exports came under pressure, largely owing to a sharp decline in food exports, particularly rice,” the statement read.
“On the financing side, net inflows remained tepid. Despite this, SBP’s FX (foreign exchange) reserves have crossed the December 2025 target of $15.5bn, led by continued FX purchases by the central bank,” it added.
The statement added that changing trade dynamics may constrain Pakistan’s exports, while lower global oil prices may contain imports.
“On balance, the assessment for the current account is broadly unchanged, and the deficit is projected to remain within 0 to 1pc of GDP in FY26,” the MPC said. “Moreover, with the realisation of planned official inflows, SBP’s FX reserves are projected to strengthen to $17.8bn by June 2026.”
The MPC noted that in Q1-FY26, both the overall and primary balances recorded surpluses, thanks to the transfer of sizeable SBP profit.
“At the same time, the expenditure to GDP ratio remained lower than last year’s comparable level, which also contributed to this fiscal performance,” the statement read.
“Meanwhile, the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) collection slowed down considerably to 10.2pc [year-on-year] during July-November FY26, implying significant acceleration required to achieve the budgeted tax collection target in the remaining seven months of FY26,” it added.
The committee further said that interest payments were expected to be lower than the budgeted amount for the year and help contain the fiscal deficit.
“The MPC underscored the importance of structural reforms, especially to broaden the tax base and privatise loss-making SOEs (state-owned enterprises), to strengthen fiscal buffers while creating space for public investment and needed spending for socioeconomic uplift,” the statement added.
According to the statement, since the committee’s last meeting, broad money growth accelerated to 14.9pc as of November 28. Due to borrowing by key sectors like textiles, wholesale and retail and chemicals, private sector credit ballooned by Rs187bn between July and November.
“Consumer financing, particularly automobile loans, remained strong in the wake of easing financial conditions, improved consumer sentiments and a stable macroeconomic environment,” the statement read.
“On the liability side, currency in circulation broadly remained unchanged, whereas an increase in deposits led to a moderate decline in the currency-to-deposits ratio.”
The MPC also observed that headline inflation remained within the medium-term target range over the past three months, with food, energy and core components of inflation beginning to converge.
“In this context, the prudent monetary policy stance, complemented by fiscal discipline, is helping stabilise inflation within the target range, despite recent supply-side frictions and relatively sticky core inflation,” the committee stated. “Moreover, inflation expectations also remain anchored.”
However, inflation is expected to rise past the target range towards the end of the current fiscal year, before reverting to base levels in FY2027.
“The committee noted that this outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity prices, magnitude and timing of energy price adjustments, fiscal slippages, and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items,” the statement added.
‘A welcome move’
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction with the cut in interest rates, hailing the move as a “harbinger of … improvement of the business community and the common man”.
“By the grace of Allah, the hard work of the government’s economic team is bearing fruit, the PM said, praising Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team for their efforts.
“There is economic stability in the country and Pakistan is moving towards development,” he added. “The business community and the public have made sacrifices for economic stability. The economic improvement is providing relief to the public as much as possible.”
The PM said that small and medium-sized businesses will benefit the most from the reduction in interest rates and access to loans at low cost.
Yousuf M Farooq, the research director at Chase Securities, called the cut “a welcome move”, provided the current account stays contained and the exchange rate can act as a shock absorber if external pressures re-emerge.
“Lower rates should be supportive for equities by lifting valuation multiples and easing financing costs, particularly for leveraged sectors,” he told Dawn.
“It should also help stimulate domestic demand while reducing the government’s interest expense.”
Farooq noted that while a 50bps reduction is not material on its own, it clearly signals the direction of policy in the coming months.
Meanwhile, AKD Securities Research Director Avais Ashraf told Dawn that the slashed rate would improve domestic industry and make exports more competitive.
“We expect its impact on trade imbalance to remain manageable as food supplies improve,” he said.
Ashraf noted that the recent surge in trade balance was caused by a disruption in food supplies amid higher rains and floods in the monsoon season this year.
“Higher food imports and lower food exports exert pressure on [the] current account that remain manageable given robust remittances and manageable interest payments,” he stated.
Ashraf expressed concern over the growing import of automobiles, which is increasing despite government restrictions on financing terms.
Topline Securities wrote in an X post that the slashed policy rate was a “surprise”, as they expected the rates to remain unchanged.
“In last four monetary policy meetings, [the] SBP observed [the] status quo. [The] last cut of 100bps was announced in [a] May 5, 2025 meeting,” the post read.







The last reduction in the policy rate came in May. Since then, the benchmark rate has been held at 11pc, even as headline inflation dipped to 3pc earlier this year. November inflation was recorded at 6.1pc, compared to 6.2pc in October.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised maintaining tight liquidity to curb expected inflation, despite mounting industry pressure.
In a second review released on Thursday, the Fund said the monetary policy needed to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored, while noting that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Industrial leaders had previously called for a reduction in interest rates to help them stay competitive globally.</p><small>2025-12-15 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151735500c0628a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961268/overseas-minister-says-pm-shehbaz-has-taken-notice-of-passengers-being-offloaded-at-airports-committee-formed' target='_blank'><strong>Overseas minister says PM Shehbaz has taken notice of passengers being offloaded at airports, committee formed</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the frequent offloading of passengers travelling abroad, ordering the constitution of a committee to look into the matter, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain said on Monday.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown was launched on migrant smuggling following the Greece boat tragedy in 2024, one which claimed several Pakistani lives.
In a statement issued today, the minister stated that PM Shehbaz had formed a “special committee” to look into the issue of offloading passengers at airports and to ensure safe migration.
“Recently, despite having complete documentation, some passengers have still been offloaded,” the minister said. “People who held valid visas were offloaded as well.”
The committee will prepare “recommendations regarding the safe migration of people,” the minister was quoted as saying.
He detailed that a meeting of the committee is expected this week.
“By the end of January, we will prepare proposals to address these issues, “ he shared, stressing that safe migration was a “fundamental right”.
The minister also lauded the International Organisation of Migration’s (IOM) work for ensuring safe migration.
Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a visit to the Islamabad airport, said that no passenger in possession of “genuine and complete documents” should be barred from travelling abroad.
On November 27, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151724244235b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961270/soldier-martyred-in-di-khan-counter-insurgency-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Soldier martyred in DI Khan counter-insurgency operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement.
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1515335470d8688.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961266/aurangzeb-highlights-pakistans-strategic-shift-to-restore-economic-confidence' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb highlights Pakistan’s strategic shift to restore economic confidence</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb underscored Pakistan’s strategic shift from seeking aid-based support towards trade- and investment-led engagement to ensure long-term economic sustainability and mutually beneficial partnerships, particularly with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
In an interview with CNN Business Arabia, Aurangzeb highlighted the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which reflected Pakistan’s renewed economic confidence and reform momentum.
He said that Pakistan has followed a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilisation program for the past 18 months, which has delivered tangible and measurable results, while inflation has declined to single-digit levels from an unprecedented 38%.
On the fiscal front, Pakistan has achieved primary surpluses, while the current account deficit remains well within targeted limits. According to the finance czar, the exchange rate has also stabilised, and foreign exchange reserves have improved to approximately 2.5 months of import cover, reflecting strengthening external buffers.
He maintained that the country has two major external validations, which indicate Pakistan’s improving economic outlook.
Firstly, he said, all three international credit rating agencies have aligned their assessments this year by upgrading Pakistan’s ratings and outlook. On the other hand, the country has completed the second review under the IMF Extended Fund Facility, with the IMF Executive Board granting its approval earlier this week.
He stated that such developments demonstrate growing international confidence in Pakistan’s economic management and reform trajectory.
The finance minister further emphasised that macroeconomic stabilisation has been achieved through a coordinated approach combining disciplined monetary and fiscal policies with an ambitious structural reform agenda.
“Reforms are being implemented across key areas, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, public financial management, and privatisation, aimed at consolidating stability and laying the foundation for sustainable growth,” Aurangzeb said.
The finance minister also highlighted the significant progress in Pakistan’s improvement of the tax-to-GDP ratio.
“During the last fiscal year, it increased to 10.3 per cent, with a clear path towards 11 per cent,” the finance minister said.
He further explained the government’s objective to reach a level of tax collection that ensures fiscal sustainability over the medium to long term.
“This is being pursued through widening the tax base by bringing previously undertaxed but economically significant sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale and retail trade into the formal net, alongside deepening compliance by reducing leakages through production monitoring systems and AI-enabled technologies. Simultaneously, the tax administration is being transformed through reforms in people, processes, and technology,” he said.
The minister further highlighted efforts to improve governance in [power] distribution companies, involve private sector expertise, advance privatisation, and reduce circular debt, which has long constrained the power sector.
“Rationalising the tariff regime is essential to making energy more competitive for industry, thereby enabling industrial revival and economic growth,” he stressed.
Senator Aurangzeb acknowledged the longstanding support of GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, for their critical role in critical role supporting Pakistan through financing, funding, and cooperation at international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.
“This relationship is now evolving towards a new phase centred on trade expansion and investment flows. Remittances continue to play a vital role in supporting the current account, with inflows reaching approximately $38 billion last year and projected to rise to $41-42 billion this year, over half of which originates from GCC countries,” he added.
He further said, “Pakistan is actively engaging with GCC partners to attract investment in priority sectors including energy, oil and gas, minerals and mining, artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture.”
Expressing optimism regarding progress on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the GCC, he termed the discussions at an “advanced stage”.
Senator Aurangzeb reiterated the government’s strategic direction in shifting the collective focus on trade rather than relying on aid.
“Pakistan’s future lies in fostering trade and investment partnerships rather than reliance on aid,” said the finance minister.
He also emphasised the role of foreign direct investment in supporting the higher GDP growth, generating employment opportunities, and delivering shared economic benefits for Pakistan and its partners.
“The government is fully mobilised to translate this vision into reality.” He concluded.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1512595218ce8ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961257/justice-jahangiri-objects-to-ihc-cj-led-division-bench-hearing-fake-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Jahangiri objects to IHC CJ-led division bench hearing fake degree case</strong></a><br><p>Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri appeared before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday, presenting arguments in his defence against challenges to the legitimacy of his law degree and appointment as a judge while also raising objections over the division bench hearing the case.
The controversy surrounding the IHC judge’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
A two-member IHC bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and also comprising Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, took up the matter on Monday in a packed courtroom.
The same bench had declared Dawood’s plea maintainable at the last hearing on December 9, issuing a verdict that was reserved in July last year. It had also barred Justice Jahangiri from judicial work in September, but the order was later set aside by the Supreme Court (SC).
Arguing his case, Justice Jahangiri raised the preliminary objection that the division bench was “inappropriate” to hear the case as a separate petition concerning its members was pending.
This, apparently, was a reference to challenges to Justice Dogar’s appointment as the IHC CJ.
“We have filed a petition against you. You cannot hear this case,” Justice Jahangiri asserted.
Moving on to defending his qualification, he contended that the case was based on a 34-year-old educational record.
“I am ready to take an oath on the Holy Quran that my degree is genuine,” he contended. The judge also argued that the KU never declared his degree fake.
He also took an exception to the “haste” in which proceedings were being held, arguing against the issuance of a three-day notice to address a decades-old matter.
At the last hearing, the CJ Dogar-led bench had gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed in the case till date. The registrar’s office had served the notice at Justice Jahangiri’s chamber due to time constraints, and sources had told Dawn that court staff of the judge received the notice and submitted it to his chamber.
After raising objections in this regard on Monday, Justice Jahangiri also criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
“Never in the judicial history of Pakistan and India has such a thing happened […] Not even a patwari (revenue official) was stopped from work the way I was,” he remarked.
The judge sought an adjournment to be able to hire a lawyer for himself and acquire the complete case record, stating, “So little time has been given. I have to get a lawyer and prepare.”
On the other hand, petitioner Dawood requested the court to hear the case on a daily basis.
The court adjourned the hearing until December 18 (Thursday), summoning the KU registrar in person and seeking the record of Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
The IHC judge was also given time until then to engage a lawyer.
CJ Dogar assured Justice Jahangiri that he would receive justice.
Throughout the hearing, CJ Dogar also repeatedly instructed lawyers, who attended the hearing in large numbers, to return to their seats, emphasising, “Honourable Justice Jahangiri has come to me … I want to hear him.”
Protracted legal trajectory
The controversy around Justice Jahangiri’s law degree has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.</p><small>2025-12-15 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1511231503245c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961250/pakistan-origin-man-living-in-sydney-falsely-identified-as-bondi-beach-gunman-fears-his-life-is-in-danger' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney falsely identified as Bondi Beach gunman fears his life is in danger</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney has said he had received death threats and was “terrified” to leave his home after his photo was widely shared online as the gunman responsible for the Bondi Beach shooting, it emerged on Monday.
Two gunmen on Sunday had opened fire at a Hanukkah gathering in Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 15 in Australia’s worst incident of gun violence since 1996. Police have not yet disclosed the names of the suspects, who happen to be father and son, or their motives. However, various news outlets identified them as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively.
The father first came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told reporters on Monday. He was killed at the scene. His son — an Australian-born citizen according to the home affairs minister — is critically injured and being treated in a Sydney hospital bed under police guard.
Photos of a beaming man in a green Pakistan cricket jersey had subsequently pinged across social media. Some of the posts were shared thousands of times, drawing vitriolic comments.
But the photo was taken from the Facebook profile of a different Naveed Akram, who pleaded on Monday for people to stop the misinformation in a video published by the Pakistan Consulate of Sydney.
The video was also picked up by Australia’s SBS News, with Akram, who runs his own business and arrived in Australia in 2018, saying, “As per media reports, one of the shooters, his name is Naveed Akram. My name is also Naveed Akram. Unfortunately, our names are the same.”
“I just want you to know that that person is a different person,” he added.
“That is not me, and I have nothing to do with that incident or that person,” Akram said as he condemned the shooting. He further said that this “propaganda” was being spread through “Indian accounts”.
He appealed to people to report instances of his photos being linked to the shooting, adding that he was “stressed and scared”.
“I really need your help because this is a life-threatening event and there can be many issues that can arise from this,” he was quoted as saying.
“I can’t even go outside safely,” he added.
The 30-year-old, who lives in a northwestern suburb of Sydney, told AFP he first heard around 9:30pm on Sunday that he had been falsely identified as the shooter.
“I could not even sleep last night,” Akram told AFP by phone, adding he deleted all the “terrible” messages he got.
“I’m terrified. I could not go outside, like it’s a life-threatening issue, so I don’t want to risk anything … my family is worried as well, so it’s quite a hard time for me.”
He asked the Pakistan Consulate to put out the video because relatives in Punjab were getting phone calls as well.
“It was destroying my image, my family’s image,” he said.
“People started to call them. They were worried, and they have told the police over there.”
The Pakistan native moved to Australia in 2018 to attend Central Queensland University and later did a masters at Sydney’s Holmes Institute.
Today he runs a car rental business, and he said Australia is “the perfect country”.
“I love this country. I have never had any safety issues here, like everyone is so nice, the people are so nice here,” Akram said.
“It’s only this incident that has caused me this trauma.”</p><small>2025-12-15 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151344358959c27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960922/rethinking-pakistans-higher-defence' target='_blank'><strong>RETHINKING PAKISTAN’S HIGHER DEFENCE</strong></a><br><p>“From Plato to Nato, the history of command in war consists of an endless quest for certainty…historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty…to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man, allowed to do only that which could be controlled; the other, to design organisations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control. …the second of these methods has, by and large, proved more successful than the first…”

SITUATING THE ISSUE
Among other changes brought in by the 27th Constitutional Amendment, one relates to the creation of the office of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). The position, which is to represent command of all three services, will not exist as an independent office but will be held concurrently by whoever is Chief of the Army Staff, beginning with the current incumbent. The amendment also extends the tenure of the current army chief/CDF as also those who would succeed him.
The issue of the probity of the amendment and the manner in which it was pushed through continues to be debated. The delay in the notification gave rise to much speculation about the grey areas in the draft, which seemed tailored for specific circumstances and person but will impact the Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) and civil-military relations beyond this moment and its politics. Expectedly and rightly, the debate on the political aspects of the amendment should continue.
My purpose here, however, is different and is related to analysing the argument, given by some former generals, that there’s nothing novel about the changes that have been made in the HDO because the issue was long being debated within the organisation and the system. They have argued that, in light of evolving warfare, the imperative for ‘jointness’ — seamless operational coordination among the services — has now been formalised through these changes.
On the face of it, these arguments cannot be faulted. For instance, the need for coordination at all three levels — tactical (where battles are fought), operational (where planning is done to achieve the desired outcomes), and politico-strategic (the highest level that informs the purpose of war as also the direction and intent of the other two levels) — should be obvious. War is not a clash of mobs. It requires disciplined forces that must operate to create synergies. That requires coordination.

The 27th Constitutional Amendment promises streamlined command across the military services by creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces. But neither is this a novel concept, nor is the current interpretation without its issues. History shows that organisational redesign alone cannot overcome the realities of conflict. Ejaz Haider urges revisiting the details of an important and necessary doctrine…

However, agreeing with the obvious or stating it without reference — in this case, to factors that do not fall within the operational domain — is not the same thing as agreeing with the details of how it is to be achieved and why in a particular way and not in another.
Further, while jointness is much talked about, like strategy, a term that has almost become meaningless, it must be problematised. It is neither a magic wand nor even desirable in many battle scenarios. We shall return to that.
At this point, a caveat is in order. What follows is my view. There can be many views. Debates over doctrines and the best courses of action have to continue. Wars usually settle them!
One example is the post-WWI debate in France over static and mobile defences. Critics of the idea of the Maginot Line — a vast French system of concrete fortifications, obstacles and weapon installations built along its eastern borders (Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland) in the 1930s — argued that it symbolised passivity, would be costly and a drain on resources and would not be effective against German manoeuvre warfare. The proponents argued that it would provide a strong defence, a base for counterattack and force the Germans into Belgium, drawing their main thrust into a pre-planned battleground.
As it happened, the real test came with the German offensive. The Germans didn’t attack the main line. They rapidly advanced through the supposedly impassable Ardennes Forest, getting around the line’s northern end. The French, who had committed their best mobile forces to Belgium, had left the Ardennes and the road to Paris vulnerable. The point is that debates over this and that can only be settled when the real test of battle comes.
The second issue is that wars are not linear. Nor do they follow a particular template, at least not for the winning side, which wins precisely because it does something different, unexpected. As the celebrated German Panzer commander Gen Hermann Balck once said, “There can be no fixed schemes. Every scheme, every pattern is wrong. No two situations are identical. That is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous.”
In other words, the official view remains untested.
Let me begin this discussion with some history related to HDO in this country, take a look at jointness and its attendant problems and square it off with how battles frustrate top-down planning and why it is important to keep things simple.

HAVE WE THOUGHT OF JOINTNESS ONLY NOW?
The short answer is no. We thought of it way back in the 1970s, after realising the organisational failures, both vertically and horizontally, in the 1965 and 1971 Wars. Gen Ehsanul Haq, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably a most experienced officer, wrote an excellent paper (2013) for the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on higher defence organisation.
The paper briefly traces the history of why the government of the day established the Joint Staff Headquarters (JSHQ) in March 1976, how and why the centrality of that JSHQ was undermined and what needs to be done to return to what was started in the mid-’70s.
The paper is easily available for anyone interested in reading it, so I won’t go into the details of Gen Haq’s arguments. Two points are important, though. The first is a direct quote from the paper: “Given the political history of Pakistan, unless we build up credible security policy making mechanisms subordinated to Parliament and civilian control, ad hoc and parochial interests would continue to impact our policy formulation processes, undermining critical aspects of our national defence effort [Italics added].”
This, as should be obvious, establishes the principle of civilian control and the fact that, in war’s three levels, the highest is the domain of the civilian principals.
The second point is that jointness did not really require reinventing the wheel. JSHQ was meant precisely for that and, as Gen Haq suggested in 2013, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) could have been made Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff or, if we like CDF better for some reason, CJCSC could have been renamed CDF or CDS or whatever suits our fancy.
The only point where I disagreed with Gen Haq’s excellent analysis when I first read the paper 12 years ago was his suggestion that “while the Chairman may continue to be from the Army (due to the predominance of land strategy and asymmetry in the size of the services), the Vice Chairman [4-star] may be on rotation between the Navy and the Air Force.”
General Haq’s suggestion is/was in good faith. My disagreement then was based on two factors: JSHQ became dysfunctional precisely because of the army and the praetorian tendency of certain chiefs.
In fact, within 14 months of the reorganisation of high defence, Gen Ziaul Haq mounted his coup, essentially kicking the chessboard to play solitaire. To break that cycle and move away from the army’s primacy, the office was to rotate among the three services.
Second, jointness is not about service size. Just like an army CJCS or a CDF cannot make naval operational strategy and would need the navy’s input, a navy CJCS would need the army’s or air force’s inputs for land and air operations.
Now I have a third objection, given the type of war we have witnessed: non-contact, technical and high-intensity, no ground incursions. (This is not to say there can’t be ground incursions. Small-scale incursions can and would likely happen, but the thrust has generally changed.) If the idea of jointness has to have any meaning in the operational sense, the air force has emerged as the thin end of the wedge and, in any future round, the navy could likely get involved on its own and with dedicated air assets in support from the air force.
Within land forces, ground air defence (AD) and long-range artillery have emerged as the main fighting elements. This is unlikely to change and this is where ground AD will have to be fully integrated with PAF. Cyber is a new element but will be central to many operations.
Given these and other factors, we have to look anew at the traditional centrality of land forces as the backbone of military operations — ie the assertion that the army, given its sheer size, is not just primus inter pares [first among equals] but the dominant force. It is not, from an operational perspective, the politics of the issue notwithstanding.
Critics might point to the Russo-Ukraine War and say land forces are critical. That situation does not obtain between Pakistan and India. Neither has the sustainment capacity for long, meat-grinding wars and both are nuclear armed. The Russo-Ukraine scenario would mean — even if we discount the sustainment factor — that either one or the other will resort to nuclear weapons or else the weapons and the entire concept of deterrence through them has been bunkum.
LET’S TALK JOINTNESS AND COORDINATION
There’s a reason for this. The neatness of ‘jointness’ and coordination on the drawing board must get tested in the messy reality of the battlefield, as it often does.
The US military should know. Their Joint Publication 1, whose latest iteration came in 2023, promises to be “the capstone publication for all joint doctrine, presenting fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the employment of the Armed Forces of the United States.” Yet, we have seen the US military grapple with the contingencies of irregular wars and has often failed strategically, even when winning tactical battles.
A good example is the military presentation of plans. Maps, symbols, arrows, timelines. Units represented by icons. They assume perfect (or at least good) communication, shared situational awareness, adherence to timelines and probable enemy reactions.
But information is never perfect — radios don’t work well in nullah beds. The enemy can be wily and Boyd Cycle you, to quote Lind, which basically refers to US Air Force Col John Boyd’s ‘OODA’ loop — observe, orient, decide, act. Whoever can run the OODA loop faster is better placed. Exercises and simulations try to model friction but they cannot go beyond controlled variables. The reality, when the shooting begins, is about exhausted, scared humans with equipment malfunctioning and everything that can possibly go wrong going wrong.
A supposedly rapid advance on a map becomes a gruelling slog through mud, traffic jams on narrow bridges, or unexpected urban sprawl. If you think this is fiction or unlikely, just recall what happened to the Russian forces advancing on the north-south axis towards Kyiv from Belarus.
The conceptual Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) of the 1980s was thought to reduce and ultimately eliminate the fog of war. The First Gulf War further entrenched this idea. Since then, battlegrounds have made clear to both practitioners and theoreticians that the fog comes in many ways and no one can get rid of it. Cutting-edge technology can help defeat forces in conventional conflicts but the fog sets in when a military tries, as the US did, to grapple with populations.
Technology, however useful, can fail. GPS can be spoofed, software can crash, batteries can die. Ukrainian artillery with GPS-guided HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] rounds realised the Russians were jamming and spoofing their GPS signals. It was back to relying on non-GPS rounds and old-school artillery methods both for battery and counter-battery.
Take logistics. The perfectly synchronised attack can falter when one unit runs out of fuel, ammunition or food, because a supply convoy was ambushed, or the map was read wrong by a unit. Any military officer reading this would nod in agreement with a sad face.
One only has to read reports from the Russo-Ukraine front and even about the genocidal Zionist occupation force. Fear, fatigue, fog (in the case of Donbas, a real one!). Humans are not robots. They get exhausted. Exhaustion degrades decision-making among commanders and the fighting spirit among soldiers.
To top it all. The dastardly enemy has an independent will. He is the greatest source of disorder because, unsurprisingly, he actively seeks to disrupt coordination. He ambushes command posts, attacks supply lines and flanks, jams communications, feints and deceives. What he does can throw everything awry: planned timelines and sequences.
Does this mean planning and coordination are meaningless? No! If anything, they are even more important. As in most endeavours in life, the paradox is that planning is essential precisely because it will go wrong. In other words, coordination is crucial not because it is easy to achieve for the reasons cited above (and they aren’t exhaustive), but because its absence can be catastrophic.
Put another way, it provides a commonly-understood baseline and shared intent for all fighting echelons in that theatre of operations. When communication breaks down, which can often happen, leaders at the tactical level can make decisions based on the operational commander’s intent.
This is what Germans called Auftragstaktik [‘mission-tactics’ or as the US military translates it, ‘mission command’]. The term often misunderstood, like Clausewitz’s schwerpunkt (which is NOT centre of gravity), had its meaning in professionalism and an entire military culture (Prussian and German) as it evolved over a long period of time.
In his Instructions for Large Unit Commanders, Helmut Karl Bernhard von Moltke (the Elder) wrote in 1869: “In general, one does well to order no more than is absolutely necessary and to avoid planning beyond the situation one can foresee. These change very rapidly in war. Seldom will orders that anticipate far in advance and in detail succeed completely to execution. The higher the authority, the shorter and more general will the orders be. The next lower command adds what further precision appears necessary. The detail of execution is left to the verbal order, to the command. Each thereby retains freedom of action and decision within his authority.”
This passage was quoted in ‘How the Germans Defined Auftragstaktik’ by Donald E. Vandergriff, a former US Army major. Vandergriff writes, “The overall commander’s intent is for the member to strive for professionalism. In return, the individual will be given latitude in the accomplishment of their given missions.”
According to Lind, “During 19th-century war games, German junior officers routinely received problems that could only be solved by disobeying orders. Orders themselves specified the result to be achieved, but never the method (Auftragstaktik). Initiative was more important than obedience. Mistakes were tolerated as long as they came from too much initiative rather than too little.”
Today’s wars and their many battles are far more complex. No CDF can stand on high ground like Bonaparte, observe enemy movements and send directives to commanders in the field. Yes, we have satellites and other means to have eyes on the enemy, but command has to be delegated and field commanders have to think on their feet. Nothing has changed on that count and nothing is likely to.

A SYSTEM-LEVEL ANALYSIS
Critics would say: what are you talking about? Jointness is about the three services and making them fight like one unit, not in silos. A higher headquarters, in this case the CDF, will make the plans on the basis of threat assessment so the army, navy and air force can operate seamlessly, communicate with each other, be integrated.
Sounds good. The problem is, wars have different formats. A conventional war is not the same as an irregular war or low-intensity conflict. A conventional, non-contact war (May is an example) is not the same as a ground incursion. A ground incursion at a single point or even multiple points in one theatre is not the same as on a very broad front. The fight is different in the mountains from operations in the plains or the desert. Air operations are not the same as naval operations and vice versa, though air can support both ground troops and naval attack vessels. A short, sharp war is different from a long, attritive war in the trenches, which is what we are witnessing in Ukraine.
This brings into play the issues of training and doctrinal gaps. Different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols, and priorities. This is a problem which has been analysed and written about a lot within the US military.
Despite the emphasis on jointness, the US military continues to grapple with challenges like integrating complex systems, overcoming bureaucratic silos among services — what’s referred to as stove-piping — adapting to new threats (cyber, grey zone operations) etc. The services also face funding problems where the requirement of modernisation often runs into the problem of readiness. This invariably leads to inter-services friction. True jointness, in addition to other impediments, requires overcoming deep-seated institutional biases.
Again, the point is not that jointness should be ditched. It’s a process. Joint planning forces different services to communicate, reveal their capabilities and limitations, and build (some) shared understanding before the battle. This relationship-building is as valuable as the plan itself. Equally, the plan cannot be taken as a rigid script. At best, it’s a foundation for adaptation whose goal, howsoever difficult, is to adapt together more effectively than the enemy.
Put another way, coordination in real-battle conditions is often a patchwork effort to manage chaos at the operational and tactical levels. The elegant flowchart can only provide design principles. To expect more of it is to assume that one side has perfect information and, therefore, can work out every little detail about the adversary’s moves. That is simply not possible.
Another downside of jointness and creating multiple headquarters that link up with a single office is bureaucratisation.
This problem has been dealt with by various writers in relation to the US military, albeit that’s just one example. Personally, I find Edward Luttwak’s The Pentagon and the Art of War: The Question of Military Reform to be an incisive account. Luttwak highlights how the Pentagon’s immense budget often funds technically impressive but strategically useless weapons systems and is driven by bureaucratic incentives rather than genuine military need.
Reason: large bureaucracies, in this case the Pentagon, prioritise internal processes, career advancement, and complex planning over effective outcomes, leading to waste and strategic blunders. Luttwak coined the “Luttwak Paradox”, which suggests that military efforts often become less effective as they become more complex and technically advanced.
Jointness demands inter-services interface. In reality it means (again the US military’s example) that an individual service’s bureaucracy is not replaced. Instead, a new layer on top of existing bureaucracies is added. As identified by various writers, this means that a commander must navigate not only their own service’s logistics, personnel and acquisition systems but also the protocols, politics and resource battles of the joint structure. What begins with creating agility and clarity ends up doing the opposite: slowing things down.
Complexity in systems is a subject long debated since American sociologist Charles Perrow’s analysis of the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown accident. What’s true of tightly coupled engineering systems and the cascading effect of failure in one spreading through the system is also true — in a different way — of complex human organisations.
A good example of how what begins as an elegant concept can end up badly in the heat of battle was the ‘Systemic Operational Design’ created and introduced into the Zionist Occupation Force by Brig Gen Shimon Naveh, who headed the defunct Israeli Operational Theory Research Institute. The language of the concept, given the complexity it introduced, was never understood by the fighting echelons and their commanders who went to battle Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006.
Success lies not in the most elaborate joint plan, but in creating the conditions where a simple directive, empowered subordinates, and shared awareness can produce coherent action in chaos. The system must be designed not for neatness on the drawing board, but for resilience under stress — and that almost always favours robust simplicity over fragile complexity, to use Lebanese-American writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s phrase.
The challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising, to the extent possible, the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it. The aim is, to use the title of US Gen Stanley McChrystal’s book, create a ‘team of teams’ culture that coordinates organically and is not a rigid, top-down machine that requires constant management. In essence, go back to Elder Moltke’s advice: keep it simple.
EPILOGUE
Let’s recap: if we can make three disparate services with their own roles, systems, training protocols etc to roll together, that’s great. But if such integration is not done intelligently, it can end up defeating the very purpose for which jointness was undertaken.
The other point, as discussed above, is that jointness was conceptualised and a system put in place in 1976. It was made to fail because allowing it to work would have undermined army chiefs and how they control(led) politics. Laying waste to that system, instead of strengthening it had nothing to do with military professionalism.
What 27th Amendment has done is to constitutionalise what was long debated and opposed by proponents of balanced civil-military relations. To cloak it in the shiny garbs of jointness and operational integration is to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes.
Jointness requires input from all services. Given the conduct of war, in most cases, the air force and navy will have a bigger role to play. If we are indeed looking for jointness from an operational, not political, angle then the office of CDF should be separate from the office of army chief, stand on its own and above the offices of service chiefs. And, yes, it should rotate among the three services.
Finally, no matter how sound the planning at the top, battles are fought on the ground. It’s ultimately the commander in the field — at any level — who needs to have the Odyssean metis or what Bonaparte, in a different context, called coup d’œil — the glance that takes in a comprehensive view.

The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has registered cases against several YouTubers on charges of promoting and encouraging a gambling application, including Butt and Mubarak.
Both social media influencers appeared in front of Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed Qureshi on Monday.
Their lawyers contended that the two wanted to join the investigation against them to prove their innocence.
The judge granted pre-arrest bail to Butt and Mubarak, restraining the NCCIA from arresting them till January 6. The judge also directed both suspects to join the investigation before the next date of hearing.
The development comes days after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, who had arrived in Pakistan from London on Dec 10.
Subsequently, the two had approached the Lahore sessions court and filed separate bail petitions.
Cases against the two
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1513050606bffff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961259/years-last-nationwide-polio-campaign-to-immunise-45m-children-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Year’s last nationwide polio campaign to immunise 45m children begins</strong></a><br><p>The last nationwide polio campaign of 2025 began on Monday, with the aim of vaccinating 45.5 million children across the country, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The week-long polio drive is set to run until December 21.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
According to the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC), more than 400,000 frontline polio workers will take part in the campaign. More than 23m children will be immunised in Punjab, over 16m in Sindh, more than 7.2m in KP and over 2.6m in Balochistan. In Islamabad, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 400,000 children.
In Sindh, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah inaugurated the polio campaign in Karachi by administering polio drops to children.
“Over 10.6m children will be vaccinated across 30 districts and 1,345 union councils, with 80,000+ frontline workers & 21,000 cops deployed,” the Sindh CM House said on X.







Addressing the ceremony, CM Murad urged parents, influencers, and communities to cooperate with polio workers during the campaign.
He noted that there had been a “surge” in cases in the past two to three years, noting that Sindh had recorded nine cases in 2025.
The chief minister also recalled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s efforts towards polio eradication. “She administered polio drops to her own daughter Aseefa,” Murad said.
He also remarked that it was “a cause for shame that Pakistan and Afghanistan were the only countries in the world where polio has not yet been eradicated”, calling on the media to “play their part”.
“In the past year, as well, I requested the media to play a public service message of 5-10 seconds before every hourly news headlines for polio awareness,” he said, lamenting that no channel had implemented this.
Meanwhile, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who is also a member of the National Assembly, urged parents and communities to ensure the vaccination of every child under the age of five.
“As Pakistan enters the final polio vaccination campaign of 2025 from December 15-21, I urge parents, communities and leaders to ensure every child under five is vaccinated. This mission, launched under Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, must be completed together,” she said on X.







Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-15 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15120122a42c802.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961253/pakistan-condemns-heinous-attack-on-un-peacekeepers-in-sudan-calls-for-holding-perpetrators-responsible' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan condemns ‘heinous’ attack on UN peacekeepers in Sudan, calls for holding perpetrators responsible</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday condemned the “heinous” attack which claimed the lives of six United Nations (UN) peacekeepers from Bangladesh in Sudan’s Kadugli, calling for holding those responsible accountable.
At least six Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed and eight wounded in a drone attack on a UN base on Saturday in the disputed Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan, according to Bangladesh’s armed forces.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous attack against UN peacekeepers in Kadugli, Sudan, which has resulted in the tragic deaths of six peacekeepers from Bangladesh serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (Unisfa), and injuries to several others.”
It expressed Pakistan’s deepest condolences to the government and people of Bangladesh on the lives lost, adding that Pakistan stood in solidarity with the bereaved families.
“UN peacekeepers remain at the forefront of international efforts to prevent conflict, protect civilians, and support peace under the UN flag,” the FO statement said.
“We pay homage to the ultimate sacrifice made by these Blue Helmets in the line of duty for peace and stability in the region,” it added.
The FO also called for a swift investigation to identify the perpetrators of the “cowardly attack” and to hold the responsible parties accountable.
“We will also continue to work closely with members of the UN Security Council and the international community to ensure the safety and security of all UN peacekeepers,” it said.







Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions and its troops have long been deployed in the volatile region.
In a statement on Sunday, the Bangldesh armed forces’ public relations division said, “A drone attack was carried out by separatist armed groups on the Kadugali Logistics Base under the UN peacekeeping mission in Abyei, Sudan yesterday (Saturday) from approximately 3:40pm to 3:50pm local time.”
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing his condolences to the families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.
“Attacks against UN peacekeepers like this one are unjustifiable & may constitute war crimes. I remind everyone of their obligation to protect UN personnel and civilians,” he said.

The father, a 50-year-old, was killed at the scene, taking the number of dead to 16, while his 24-year-old son was in a critical condition in hospital, police said at a press conference on Monday.
The father and son were identified as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively, by state broadcaster ABC and other local media outlets.
Officials have described Sunday’s shooting as a targeted anti-Semitic attack.
Forty people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. The victims were aged between 10 and 87.
Witnesses said the attack at the famed beach, which was packed on a hot evening, lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets.
Police said around 1,000 people had attended the targeted Hanukkah event, which was held in a small park off the beach.
A bystander captured on video tackling and disarming an armed man during the attack has been hailed as a hero whose actions saved lives.
7News Australia named him as Ahmed al Ahmed, citing a relative, who said the 43-year-old fruit shop owner had been shot twice and had undergone surgery.

A fundraising page for the man had raised more than A$350,000 (£233,000) by Monday afternoon.
Amid speculations regarding the identity and ethnic background of the attackers, police did not release the shooters’ names but said the father had held a firearms licence since 2015 and had six licensed weapons.
Home Minister Tony Burke said the father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, while his son is an Australian-born citizen.
Police did not provide details about the firearms, but videos from the scene showed the men firing what appeared to be a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun.
“We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters.
According to ABC, the two had possible links to the Islamic State group. Senior officials in the investigation told the ABC that two IS flags were found in the gunmen’s car at the beach, although New South Wales police said they could not confirm the report.
Bondi local Morgan Gabriel, 27, said she had been heading to a nearby cinema when she heard what she thought were fireworks, before people started running up her street.
“I sheltered about six or seven. Two of them were actually my close friends, and the rest were just people that were on the street. But people, their phones had been left down the beach, and everyone was just trying to get away,” she said.
“It’s a very sad time this morning … Normally, like on a Monday or any morning, it’s packed. People are swimming, surfing, running. So this is very, very quiet. And there’s definitely a solemn sort of vibe.”
A makeshift memorial with flowers and Israeli and Australian flags was set up at the Bondi pavilion and an online condolence book was established.
Police and private Jewish security guards wearing earpieces were positioned around as mourners paid respects and laid flowers.
World leaders condemn the attack
Authorities said they were confident only two attackers were involved in the incident, after previously saying they were checking whether a third offender was involved.
At the suspects’ home in Bonnyrigg, a suburb around 36 km west of the CBD, there was a heavy police presence on Monday, with a cordon wrapping around several neighbouring houses.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi Beach on Monday morning to lay flowers near the scene of the attack.
“What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-Semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location,” Albanese told reporters.
“The Jewish community are hurting today. Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.”
Albanese later urged Australians to light a candle in solidarity with the Jewish community “to show that light will indeed defeat darkness — part of what Hanukkah celebrates”, he said.
Albanese said several world leaders including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached out and offered condolences and support.
Sunday’s shootings were the most serious in a string of anti-Semitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023.
‘Saw bodies on the ground ’
Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at the Port Arthur tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania.
Rabbi Mendel Kastel, whose brother-in-law Eli Schlanger was killed in Sunday’s attack, said it had been a harrowing evening.
“You can very easily become very angry and try to blame people, turn on people but that’s not what this is about. It’s about a community,” he said.
“We need to step up at a time like this, be there for each other, and come together. And we will, and we will get through this, and we know that. The Australian community will help us do it,” he added.
Local woman Danielle, who declined to give her surname, was at the beach when the shooting occurred and raced to collect her daughter, who was attending a bar mitzvah at a function centre near where the alleged shooters were positioned.
“I heard there was a shooting so I bolted there to get my daughter, I could hear gunshots, I saw bodies on the ground. We are used to being scared, we have felt this way since October 7.”
Australia’s Jewish diaspora is small but deeply embedded in the wider community, with about 150,000 people who identify as Jewish in the country of 27 million.
About one-third of them are estimated to live in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi. Major cities including Berlin, London and New York stepped up security around Hanukkah events on Sunday following the attack at Bondi.</p><small>2025-12-15 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15110415d5439e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961248/hong-kong-court-finds-tycoon-jimmy-lai-guilty-in-landmark-security-trial' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong court finds tycoon Jimmy Lai guilty in landmark security trial</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong’s High Court on Monday found tycoon and pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces in the city’s highest-profile trial under a China-imposed national security law that could see him jailed for life.
The landmark case has drawn international scrutiny of Hong Kong’s judicial independence amid a years-long crackdown on rights and freedoms in the global financial hub after 2019 pro-democracy protests that Beijing saw as a challenge to its rule.
While 78-year-old Lai’s supporters see him as a freedom fighter, Beijing sees him as a mastermind of the protests and a conspirator advocating for US sanctions against Hong Kong and the mainland. Chinese authorities have rejected accusations of eroding the city’s rule of law.
“There is no doubt” that Lai “had harboured his resentment and hatred of” China for many of his adult years, Judge Esther Toh told a packed courtroom as the tycoon, wearing a pale green jumper and a grey jacket, sat with his arms folded.
The two other judges in his case were Alex Lee and Susana D’Almada Remedios.
Sentencing expected next year
Lai, the founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper and one of the most prominent critics of China’s Communist Party leadership, has already spent five years in jail, facing a slew of litigation under the sweeping security legislation that Beijing enacted in response to the 2019 protests.
A pre-sentencing hearing where Lai can plead for lenience is scheduled for January 12. His lawyer Steven Kwan said Lai will decide whether to appeal after the sentencing.
Hong Kong’s national security police chief Steve Li said on Monday he welcomed the verdict.
Lai, who suffers from health issues including diabetes and high blood pressure, was found guilty on two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and one of conspiracy to publish seditious material. He had pleaded not guilty on all counts.
The verdict bookends a year that marked the essential disappearance of Hong Kong’s democratic opposition under pressure from Beijing. The Democratic Party voted to disband on Sunday.
Outside the court, people overnight formed a queue more than a block long, some with camping gear, seeking to attend the verdict. Police were monitoring the area around the building.
Rights groups criticise verdict
Lai’s trial began in December 2023 in the former British colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with the verdict seen as a potential fresh diplomatic flashpoint.
Countries including the US and Britain, as well as rights groups, say the trial is politically motivated and have called for Lai’s immediate release.
US President Donald Trump raised Lai’s case with Xi in a meeting in October and has said he would do his utmost to “save” Lai.
Beh Lih Yi, Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, called the verdict a “sham conviction” and “a disgraceful act of persecution”.
“The ruling underscores Hong Kong’s utter contempt for press freedom,” she said. “Jimmy Lai’s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy.”
Media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders also described Lai’s trial as “a sham”.
The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have said the tycoon’s trial was fair and that the national security law treats all equally. They have said no freedoms are absolute when it comes to safeguarding national security.
Lai’s family say his health has worsened after more than 1,800 days in solitary confinement, and that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and heart palpitations.
His verdict comes at a delicate moment for Hong Kong, where residents have been mourning after a fire last month killed at least 160 people in one of the worst blazes in a residential complex globally in recent years.
Chinese national security authorities have warned they would crack down on any “anti-China” individuals who tried to use the fire to “plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos” of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests triggered a political crisis.</p><small>2025-12-15 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151052536fe413e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961247/police-to-release-man-detained-over-brown-university-mass-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Police to release man detained over Brown University mass shooting</strong></a><br><p>The man held as a “person of interest” in the Brown University shooting that left two students dead and nine injured will be released from custody, authorities said on Sunday night.
Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said earlier at a midday news conference that a man in his 20s had been taken into custody in connection with Saturday’s gun violence but gave no further details.
But at a late-night news conference hours later, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and other state and local officials told reporters the man detained would be released from custody, saying the investigation was going into a “different direction”.
“We have not yet solved this case, but I am confident we are going to do that in the near future,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.
Officials declined to elaborate on why the man who was taken into custody was detained in the first place.
“There was a quantum of evidence which justified detaining this person as a person of interest,” Neronha said, adding that investigators later determined there was “no basis to believe that he’s a person of interest, so … he’s being released”.
Authorities said they believed an unidentified person pictured in surveillance footage to be the person they were still looking for.
FBI Director Kash Patel said earlier on Sunday in a post on X that the person of interest had been detained in a hotel room in the Rhode Island town of Coventry, a 30-minute drive from the Brown campus.
An FBI team specialising in cellular data analysis used geolocation information to track the suspect, Patel said.







While the killer was presumed to remain at large, authorities said on Sunday night they would not reimpose an initial shelter-in-place order for the campus and surrounding community that had been lifted.
The mass shooting — the latest of nearly 400 in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive — shook the community at the university, one of the oldest in the United States.
The school cancelled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said that authorities, as of midday on Sunday, had not yet contacted all of the victims’ family members because some were travelling.
He invited residents to a previously planned event on Sunday to light a Christmas tree and a menorah to mark the first night of Hanukkah.
“It is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light tonight, I think there’s nothing better that we could be doing,” Smiley said.
Authorities release video of suspect
Seven people injured at Brown University were in stable condition, Smiley said. One remained in critical but stable condition, while another had been discharged, he added.
Shelter-in-place orders at the university and nearby areas were lifted on Sunday. Smiley said earlier in the day that residents should expect a visible police presence across the city.
The gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, officials said on Saturday.
Authorities on Saturday released a short video clip of a person of interest dressed in black walking near the engineering building.
Providence Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said on Saturday the individual may have worn a mask, but officials were not certain.
Brown President Christina Paxson told reporters that all or nearly all of the victims were students, adding: “This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has.”
Students caught by surprise
Ref Bari, 22, a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire.
Bari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her and her friends, and she agreed. They returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom.
“She trusted me,” he said. “The only connection between us is we’re both students at Brown, but beyond that, we don’t know each other.”
Teaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.
“The first couple of gunshots went straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,” Oduro said. “Who knows, if I didn’t duck, maybe I’m not here today.”
A student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.
Jack DiPrimio, another graduate student at Brown, said he was initially not concerned when the university went on lockdown because he had experienced many active-shooter drills. The drills have become more common in the US as attacks targeting students have increased.
“I had faced so many lockdowns in high school and even a few at my undergrad, so I wasn’t that worried at first,” DiPrimio said in a TikTok video after coming out of a five-hour lockdown. “Maybe I was desensitised.”</p><small>2025-12-15 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/693f47694abbe.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961157/stench-toxic-gases-from-garbage-dump-along-karachis-malir-river-plague-residents-commuters' target='_blank'><strong>Stench, toxic gases from garbage dump along Karachi’s Malir river plague residents, commuters</strong></a><br><p>• People living in Defence View say persistent smell, swarms of birds at ‘govt-managed garbage transfer station’ have made life miserable• Complain night-time movement of garbage trucks makes sleep difficult• SSWMB chief says ‘GTS Imtiaz’ functions as intermediary point where waste is first brought before being transferred to landfill sites• Claims facility will be upgraded into a covered centre by next year
KARACHI: Residents of Defence View and adjacent localities, students of nearby educational institutions and thousands of commuters using Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway are forced to endure the stench of garbage collected by authorities from across district East and dumped along the Malir riverbank.
The area is also polluted with dust, harmful fumes and toxic gases emanating from the piles of garbage.
Known as GTS Imtiaz (Garbage Transfer Station-Imtiaz), because of its proximity with the Qayyumabad outlet of the chain of department stores, the garbage dump is managed by the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB).
Dawn visited the locality where the area residents said the pungent smell, dust, toxic gases and air pollution from the site have not only disrupted daily life, but have also given rise to various health problems.
The GTS Imtiaz is one of the centres where waste collected from district East is temporarily transferred before being moved to landfill sites. However, residents claim that a facility which should have been located on the outskirts of the city has instead been established near a residential area, severely affecting the entrance to the Defence Housing Authority.
Locals said that upon entering the district, the overwhelming stench of garbage greets the people, while hundreds of kites and other birds circle the area, creating an unsightly and unhygienic environment.
According to the World Health Organisation and UN-Habitat guidelines, waste should not be left in the open at transfer stations, as these facilities are meant only for temporary storage before transfer. Open-air storage produces foul odours, harmful gases, dust, attracts flies and birds, and increases disease risks, especially near residential areas.
The UN guidelines add that proper transfer stations should use sealed containers and covered halls to control odours; without this, the facility becomes a dumping site, threatening public health and urban living.
It also mentions that children, the elderly and patients with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Continuous odours also contribute to mental stress, sleep disruption and reduced quality of life, while improper management encourages pests and risks contaminating nearby rivers or streams.
A study by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a public health agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services, states that organic waste emits gases like hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and methane during decomposition, producing a rotten-egg smell. Prolonged exposure can cause breathing difficulties, worsen asthma and allergies, trigger headaches and nausea, irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and affect the nervous system.
Frustrations grow over health risks, daily discomfort In a visit to the area, Dawn talked to residents as well as students of a nearby private university.
Defence View Phase II resident and MBBS student Maria said she and her family were facing a variety of health problems.
She added that the continuous smell and air pollution, particularly affecting respiratory health, have had a severe impact on her mother.
A passer-by said that people chose to live in upscale areas expecting better facilities and a cleaner environment.
“But when one enters the district and is immediately hit by a stench and pollution, the whole idea of living here seems pointless. The difference between affluent and ordinary areas disappears,” he added.
A student from Iqra University, located opposite the GTS Imtiaz, said the city already struggles with pollution, and daily garbage transfers at this site make the situation worse. “This is totally unfair,” he added.
A group of three other students from the same university shared that in the morning, when garbage is moved, the dust is so thick that it becomes “difficult to see, significantly reducing visibility”.
They also highlighted that a month ago, smoke from burning garbage would fill the entire university campus and classrooms, causing health issues, though burning has ceased over the past month.
Student Amna said that while a large transfer station is located on the opposite side of the university, a smaller station has been set up in the university parking area, leaving students “surrounded by garbage on both sides”.
Defence View Phase III resident Shamim Iqbal said that when garbage is moved at nights, the stench makes it almost impossible to sleep. “Even with windows and doors closed, the smell is so strong it causes nausea,” he said.
Salim, a resident of Gulshan-i-Ibrahim, Junejo Town, said that he had previously lived near Defence View Phase III but was forced to relocate due to his father’s respiratory condition. “The odour is so overpowering that even breathing becomes difficult,” he added.
A local shopkeeper said that the smell and pollution attracted flies over food items, creating serious hygiene and health issues.
Residents expressed concerns that the GTS’s location near the Malir River could exacerbate environmental risks, particularly during rains, when garbage and contaminated water might flow into the river.
They demanded that transfer stations be relocated away from residential areas or properly covered in accordance with recognised environmental and health standards.
SSWMB response
The SSWMB Managing Director, Tariq Ali Nizamani, told Dawn that the GTS Imtiaz functions as an intermediary point, where waste is first brought before being transferred to landfill sites.
He added that four of the six GTS facilities in Karachi — GTS Imtiaz, Dinga Morr, Sharafi and Gutter Baghicha — are in the process of being modernised, including GTS Imtiaz.
Mr Nizamani added that the work on the GTS Imtiaz was expected to be completed by early next year.
“Once modernisation is complete, the facility will be upgraded into a covered centre to improve the collection and transfer of waste,” he added.
Regarding complaints about garbage burning, the MD said that previously some scavengers would remove usable items from the site and burn the remaining waste. However, eight guards have now been deployed by the board to prevent such incidents from recurring.
He explained that decomposing waste produces methane gas, which poses a fire risk, considering that water bowsers have also been stationed on site to respond immediately to any potential hazards.

Both LeT and JeM were declared proscribed organisations by Pakistan in 2002.
The proposed sanctions — a global asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo — signal closer US-India counterterrorism cooperation. Yet, strikingly, the joint statement does not mention Pakistan.
That omission has not gone unnoticed, especially given India’s frequent charge that such groups operate from Pakistani soil — a claim Islamabad denies.

Joint call makes no mention of Islamabad, despite India’s wishes

Observers interpret the omission as deliberate and revealing of Washington’s strategic balancing act in South Asia.
As Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz noted: “The US may have avoided naming Pakistan. It has named India as a partner in the Indo-Pacific theatre. I wonder how long this straddling policy will last.”
The US and Indian delegations, led respectively by Monica Jacobsen of the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and India’s Counterterrorism Joint Secretary Vinod Bahade, emphasised cooperation in training, cybersecurity, judicial coordination, mutual legal assistance and intelligence-sharing.
They condemned recent attacks notably the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the Nov 10 Red Fort incident in New Delhi — stressing that “those responsible for terrorism should be held accountable”.
They also welcomed the US designation of The Resistance Front (TRF), which India blames for being behind the Pahalgam attack, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).
But as observers noted, the silence on Pakistan reflects a US desire to continue counterterrorism cooperation with India, while keeping open diplomatic space with Pakistan, whose utility Washington appears to value anew.
The broader context helps explain this approach. According to a Dec 8 Foreign Policy article titled ‘Trump’s Pivot to Pakistan’, the warming of US-Pakistan relations since mid-2025 has been dramatic.
The piece noted that President Trump has “developed a close relationship with senior Pakistani leadership, including the country’s powerful military chief, Asim Munir, whom he hosted at the White House in June and again in September, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whom he met three times this year.”
As the article reports, “The Pakistanis have done a very good job of developing a positive relationship with President Trump,” according to a former US diplomat who requested anonymity.
The logic seems tactical: Islamabad has offered “things of value” from cooperation on counterterrorism (including high-profile arrests of militants), to access to critical minerals, to interest in emerging sectors such as energy, mining, and even cryptocurrency — aligning with some of Trump’s strategic and personal predilections.
According to one former Pakistani ambassador to the US, the outreach has been carefully crafted: “They gave him the praise that he wanted,” the diplomat said.
In this context, the joint US-India terror-designation statement can be read as tactical: the US still wants to maintain the appearance of cooperation with India on counterterrorism, but avoids confrontation with Pakistan, preserving for Islamabad a renewed space in US foreign policy.
That’s why observers argue the omission of Pakistan in the joint statement is not a mere oversight, but a reflection of evolving US strategy in South Asia, where alliances are becoming more transactional, fluid and hedged.
The next session of the India-US JWGCT and Designations Dialogue scheduled in the United States will offer an early test of whether this balancing act can hold. In the meantime, the strategic triangle between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad appears more complex and fragile than ever before.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC), a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought, has urged the Taliban interim government to implement the resolution recently passed by more than 1,000 Afghan clerics against indulging in militancy abroad.
“It is now the responsibility of the Afghan interim government to ensure the implementation of the recent declaration issued by its scholars,” PUC Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said here on Sunday, terming the resolution a “positive step in the right direction”.
He said there was no difference between the stance of Afghan clerics and that of those belonging to Pakistan.
“There are two basic points in the declaration. First, they [Afghan clerics] say that aggression against Afghan soil is unacceptable, and we say that terrorism in Pakistan is unacceptable. Second, they say that Afghan soil should not be used against any other country, and we hold the same opinion. There should be no attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan and vice versa,” he added.
Stressing that peace and stability in the region are in the collective interest, he thanked Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for their attempts to negotiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Mr Ashrafi warned that any attempt to raise voices against the armed forces would be strongly resisted.
He said that if the need arose, religious seminaries and mosques would stand ready to defend the country, its security and stability. He emphasised that safeguarding the homeland was a collective responsibility.
Calling for political maturity, Mr Ashrafi urged all political parties to sit together and engage in dialogue to strengthen the country’s defence, economy and internal stability.
He criticised the use of abusive language in politics, saying that those who resorted to hate speech did not want peace in the country. He said scholars from all schools of thought had unanimously declared that violent behaviour was unacceptable. “Our objective is to take the country towards the caliphate system through peaceful means,” he added.
He also strongly condemned attacks and criticism directed at the ISPR director general following his recent press conference.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Sunday urged the Afghan Taliban to rid their country of all militant groups, while Iran stressed the need for regional cooperation, rather than foreign intervention, at a multinational Afghanistan-foc­used mee­t­ing in Tehran.
The calls for action came during a meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, plus Russia.
The Taliban were invi­ted to participate, but declined to attend, according to statements from both Iranian and Taliban officials.
The high-level gathering in the Iranian capital brought together special representatives from Paki­stan, China, Russia, Tajiki­stan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to discuss shared security concerns and strategies for engaging with Afgha­nistan’s de facto authorities.
Pakistan’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Afgha­nistan Mohammad Sadiq made the country’s position clear, emphasising the persistent threat of terrorism originating from Afghan territory.
“The continued threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil is a big challenge for the region,” Mr Sadiq said, according to a statement.
He highlighted that a stable Afghanistan, free from terrorist elements, was essential for gaining the trust of its neighbours and unlocking its vast economic potential.
“It is, therefore, imperative that the current de-facto rulers take steps to ameliorate their suffering. And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated.
He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”.







Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity.
The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021.
However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government.
“The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday.
He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan.
Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace.
“Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X.







Regional solutions
Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement.
“Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV.
He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges.
Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity.
The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted.
He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities.
Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions.
Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan.
“At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said.
Taliban decline invitation
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries.
“Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.”
Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran.
“The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X.
“This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.”

“A tweet, circulated by certain anti-Pakistan quarters, claiming that [the] whole crew of a particular PIA flight is missing, is entirely baseless,” the flag carrier said in a post on X, adding that the purpose was to “malign PIA and Pakistan”.
“There has been no such incident, and the news is fake,” it added.







Meanwhile, a PIA spokesperson issued a separate statement also denying the news, claiming that the information had been circulated by an “Afghan and anti-Pakistan account”.
“The misleading tweet is part of a well-conceived plan based on hostility towards Pakistan and is aimed at damaging the reputation of the national airline and the country,” the spokesperson said, clarifying that the news held no truth.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
On November 21, a PIA flight attendant reportedly went missing in Canada, prompting the airline to launch an inquiry into his disappearance.
​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated. “In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant.”
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-15 02:16</small></div><hr>
