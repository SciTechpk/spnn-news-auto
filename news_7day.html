<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/688ec993888fe.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928420/us-game-in-the-region' target='_blank'><strong>US game in the region</strong></a><br><p>THERE is considerable euphoria in Pakistan over what is viewed as a marked improvement in its relations with the US administration under President Donald Trump and the trough that Washington-New Delhi ties seem to have hit.
But is this euphoria well-founded and will it last? Some observers are already calling the shift in US-Pakistan relations a realignment and change in direction. If this ‘realignment’ means a shift away from Beijing for Islamabad, then I suspect these analysts may not have it right. This is simply because Beijing represents the sort of reliable partner and friend that Islamabad has been increasingly dependent on for many of its economic needs and infrastructure development. Pakistan also remains an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
More significantly, with an increasingly belligerent Hindu nationalist government in charge in New Delhi, which is constantly kicking up anti-Pakistan sentiment to cement its communal support base, Islamabad needs military hardware to deter Indian ambitions — in addition to the nuclear deterrent, of course.
Having said that, there are opportunities for Pakistan that are not part of a zero-sum game. Unlike the US, China’s relationship with not just Pakistan but other nations too isn’t based on ‘you are either with us or against us’. It is far more nuanced and pragmatic, because China for now is focused on economic development and trade.

It would be naïve to assume that ties between global powers hinge on relatively minor issues.

Western democracies often point fingers at China’s lack of political freedoms and human rights. But rarely do they laud how China has pulled 800 million people out of poverty in just 40 years. And in the current state of play, particularly in Gaza where almost the entire ‘democratic’ West is complicit in the ethnic cleansing there, while suppressing domestic dissent over this policy, they hardly have a leg to stand on when they pontificate about freedoms. The Gaza Palestinians are being denied the most basic freedom: the right to life.
For now, two things have gone in Pakistan’s favour. Firstly, Islamabad attached the right kind of importance to Trump’s narcissism. It nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and gave his ‘tough leader’ image a boost by quickly apprehending and extraditing one of the accused in the Kabul Airport ‘Abbey Gate’ bombing. The attack, which occurred in August 2021 during the US withdrawal, left 13 US service personnel and nearly 200 Afghans dead.
Then, when India attacked Pakistani targets in May last year after a terror attack in Indian-held Kashmir, and the US asked both sides for de-escalation, US sources say, Islamabad was quick to respond positively and gave the narcissistic leader a ‘win’. Trump does not tire of claiming the mantle of peacemaker for himself. This massaged his ego no end.
On the other hand, those in the know say that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made two moves that upset Trump. The first was reportedly cancelling a meeting with Trump during his US visit last year when the then presidential candidate was on the campaign trail.
The Indians firmly deny that any meeting was scheduled but during a campaign address on Sept 17 Trump said he’d be meeting Modi. Diplomatic sources said that the Modi meetings were pencilled in with both presidential candidates — Trump and Kamala Harris. The latter had to cancel her meeting due to a last-minute development and, therefore, Modi was advised by his team to also cancel the Trump meeting so he did not appear to be meeting/ endorsing one candidate. If true, this must have bruised Trump’s enormous ego.
Another irritant is said to have surfaced during India’s aggression against Pakistan in May this year. American leaders were working the phones to put a lid on the conflict before it spiralled out of control and both South Asian nations told the White House that they’d de-escalate. But India went ahead and launched missile attacks in retaliation for losing an embarrassing number of warplanes in combat, which led to the grounding of prime IAF assets for two days. Pakistan also retaliated and in the small hours of May 10, a top Pakistan official is said to have informed the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that India’s firing of dual-use missiles was a dangerous escalation and Pakistan was exercising restraint only at America’s request.
This reportedly also caused ties to sour as Trump may have felt India chose to slight America by saying one thing and doing the opposite. Although India responded to the renewed US effort and Trump was able to announce a ceasefire some heartburn had been triggered.
The chain of events may have contributed to the deterioration of ties between the US and India but it would be naïve to assume that relations between global powers hinge only on such relatively small issues, even if some of the leaders have bloated egos.
The major irritant in US-India ties is the latter country’s membership of BRICS where Russia and China have joined hands with Brazil, India, South Africa and a host of smaller countries to create a trading bloc. The grouping is pursuing the idea of a new currency for trade without the US dollar. Were this to happen, the dollar would lose its pre-eminence and the world would find a way around US sanctions through a new payment system. The US finds this intolerable, even if many see it as inevitable.
America has been propping up India as a counter to China, and New Delhi is now also part of the Quad comprising US, Australia and Japan. That is why India’s BRICS membership is seen as incompatible with the West’s strategic architecture in Asia. India may have followed a foreign policy keeping its own interest foremost. It is now being pressured to choose sides.
So, some social media mocking of India by Trump, including doomsday predictions about its economy and the new tariffs, has more to do with whipping India into line. If it works, Pakistan’s euphoria may be short-lived. If not, we’d have ringside seats to interesting game.

Published in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-08-03 04:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/688ec9f555a64.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928421/errors-in-counterterrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Errors in counterterrorism</strong></a><br><p>“THE population is the prize.” Those familiar with counterinsurgency warfare theories will recognise the context in which David Galula coined this phrase. Galula argued that insurgency is not a military contest but a political struggle, in which both insurgents and counterinsurgents vie for the population’s support and allegiance.
Recent developments in Bajaur, where citizens are protesting against military operations and the tragic events in Tirah Valley last week, when five demonstrators were killed after security forces allegedly opened fire, must be viewed through this lens. These incidents suggest an urgent need for the state to reassess its counterterrorism (CT) strategies, which appear increasingly detached from the goal of winning hearts and minds.
In his seminal book Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, Galula emphasises that military force must be subordinate to political objectives. Force used without legitimacy alienates civilians and reinforces the insurgents’ narrative. It is essential to remember that insurgents do not need to win militarily; they only need to survive, avoid defeat, and steadily erode the state’s credibility in the eyes of its people.
Militants in KP’s tribal districts have been challenging the state for the past two decades. Despite numerous operational successes, security forces remain engaged in prolonged conflict, arguably with little substantive change in their tactics or strategic orientation. The prevailing operational approach remains focused on achieving military victories while largely neglecting the critical objective of winning the population’s allegiance.
This strategic oversight not only deepens mistrust among the local population but also fosters suspicion towards the counterinsurgent forces themselves, ironically serving the militants’ very aim of delegitimising the state’s presence and actions.

A lasting solution to insurgency lies not in overwhelming military force but in political strategy.

Occasionally, the security forces convene jirgas with local tribes and mobilise lashkars against militants, as was recently seen in Bajaur, where security officials sought to gain the tribesmen’s confidence regarding their CT operations. However, such engagements are infrequent and seldom integrated into a broader strategy. The dominant pattern remains one of evacuating areas and displacing local populations or conducting small- to medium-scale operations that restrict civilian movement, often without prior warning or any provision for livelihoods.
Within this framework, engagement with local communities lacks the consistency, trust-building and institutional backing necessary for a successful CT strategy. Without a deliberate reorientation towards long-term civilian support and political legitimacy, operational victories are unlikely to translate into sustainable peace.
The engagement initiative in Bajaur came only after the launch of a military offensive against militants, a sequence that undermined its effectiveness. In that operation, three civilians, including a 12-year-old boy and a young girl, were reportedly killed, and at least 12 others injured. Engagement should have come first. The local population should have been taken into confidence before deploying a heavy military contingent and imposing prolonged curfews.
Moreover, the provincial government was apparently not brought on board during this operation, further deepening mistrust among the population. The jirga in Bajaur should have been initiated by the provincial government rather than the security forces to lend greater political legitimacy and reduce the perception of unilateral action.
KP is one of Pakistan’s most critical provinces. It is grappling with severe governance challenges and widespread political discontent. The political outlook of the majority in KP often diverges from that of the power centres in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, fostering a sense of alienation and suspicion. Several districts in the province have become ungovernable due to persistent militancy. In such a context, nothing can replace the value of a consensus-based CT strategy, one that is locally rooted and politically inclusive.
The recent incident in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley mentioned earlier, illustrates the urgency of such an approach. In response, a local jirga not only demanded a formal inquiry into the killings but also called for the evacuation of civilian homes occupied by security forces within 15 days and an end to unnecessary harassment of citizens at checkpoints. These demands reflect deep-seated grievances and highlight the need for a more humane, transparent, and politically accountable approach to security operations.
Pakistan’s departure from the colonial-era counterinsurgency approach of rule by exception was shaped by a mix of military repression and divide-and-rule politics, rooted in imperial anxieties over borders, tribal autonomy and anti-colonial resistance.
The Frontier Crimes Regulation, based on collective action, was the worst legal framework, which Pakistan abandoned after seven decades. But there is still a mindset that wants to run the affairs of the tribal districts within the same framework. If someone is thinking of bringing back these laws and restoring Fata’s status, it would be a grave mistake, which can trigger anger and mistrust.
The British co-opted the maliks and used jirgas to manage conflict and secure cooperation. Tribal lashkars were at times mobilised to act on behalf of the state. However, these colonial-era approaches can be counterproductive today. Past military operations in the tribal districts have significantly transformed the region’s social structures. The forced displacement of local populations not only traumatised communities but also exposed many to urban life and alternative social models. As a result, a new middle class is emerging in these districts, one that does not identify with colonial methods of control. While a few traditional elders and religious parties, who once benefited from draconian colonial laws, may still support such approaches, they no longer represent the broader aspirations of the population.
As echoed by David Galula and reaffirmed in modern counterinsurgency doctrines, a lasting solution to insurgency lies not in overwhelming military force but in political strategy. Counterinsurgency is 80 per cent political and only 20pc military. It demands serious attention to the underlying grievances that fuel unrest, corruption, exclusion, inadequate service delivery and ethnic or sectarian marginalisation.
Military force must be applied with precision and restraint, avoiding harm to civilians, which only deepens alienation. Insurgencies are long and complex wars; tactical victories mean little without strategic consistency and political legitimacy. The most effective strategies are those that are adaptive, locally grounded and responsive to evolving realities on the ground. The wisdom distilled from decades of conflict is simple yet profound — we can’t kill our way out of an insurgency.

In recent days, various anti-terrorism courts have handed down wholesale punishments to elected leaders and political workers affiliated with the PTI, over various cases related to the violence and rioting that broke out in parts of the country on May 9, 2023.
Scores have been convicted and handed lengthy sentences in relation to cases that were long criticised as politically motivated, built on ‘fabricated’ or weak evidence, and prosecuted without regard to due process. Several elected lawmakers, including the opposition leaders in both the Senate and the National Assembly, stand to lose their seats under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution. Some have already been de-notified by the Election Commission, including the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, in what critics describe as ‘undue haste’.
The scale of lawfare against political workers is unprecedented in Pakistan’s history. Never before have so many lawmakers and political workers been convicted during a period of what is supposed to be democratic rule, and never before have political workers been tried as terrorists. One must give credit where it is due: to politicians who campaigned long and hard for civil supremacy and democracy, and judges who once decried judicial capture.
Unfortunately, these very politicians abandoned their principles as soon as the doors to power were flung open for them, while the judges appear to have surrendered their independence and responsibility. These are difficult times, with no end in sight. The damage already wrought will take decades to heal and reverse. And yet, sadly, there seems to be no recognition or acceptance among even the civilians who hold the present regime together that it may be time to turn back.
At least those left out by the system still have the luxury of speaking rationally. Friday’s declaration, shared after the opposition’s multiparty conference, has sought a truth and reconciliation commission that could probe the collapse of the constitutional order and bring to book those “judges, generals and politicians” who have violated the Constitution, harmed democracy and usurped people’s rights. It also seeks a new charter of democracy between all political parties, along with the abolition of the ‘hybrid system’ of governance recently extolled by the defence minister.
If civil supremacy is indeed what Pakistani leaders seek, this may be the most sensible way out of the present mess. However, given their proclivity for partnerships with unelected powerbrokers, it still seems like a distant dream. The PTI may be suffering, but it still wants the blessing of its tormentors more than the sympathy of their other victims. And this, unfortunately, is our democracy’s Achilles heel.

The suspects, Sardar Sher Baz Satakzai and co-accused Mohammad Bashir, were presented before the ATC after the completion of a 10-day remand.
Police sought to prolong the remand, but the court, overseen by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, declined the request.
Following the transfer, however, the trial court of Judicial Magistrate Saifullah Tareen approved a two-day remand for the suspects.
 
 

The case involves the murders of a man and a woman, Bano Bibi, which occurred in the Digari area of the Quetta district two weeks ago.
The primary accused, Jalal Khan, who is the brother of the deceased woman, remains at large.

The first incident occurred on Saturday morning in the Langerkhel Surband area, where children playing in the fields discovered an unexploded mortar shell and brought it back to their village.
The device detonated as they played near a rainwater tank, killing five children aged between eight and 12, and injuring 13 others, including two women.
 
 

“The explosion left five children dead and 13 others, including two women, injured,” police said.

15 people, including four women, injured

The deceased were identified as Zenat Bibi, daughter of Jhang Khan; Shaila Bibi, daughter of Naimatullah; Muzammil, son of Naimatullah; Rafiullah, son of Fatehullah; and Palwasha, daughter of Bankhan; all residents of Wanda Langerkhel Surband.
The injured included Luqman, Bilal, Shadan, Latifa Bibi, Mohsin, Fawad, Jamshed, Wajeeh, Riffat, Mumtaz Bibi (wife of Bankhan), Fatima Bibi (wife of Sattar), Ahmad, and Saqib, according to the police.
ASI Zafar Mehmood, the official in charge of Lakki City police post, said he with his team was on patrol duty when they learned of the incident and immediately reached the hospital.
Separately, a villager was killed and two women injured in a quadcopter strike in the Shaikh Khula area.
Police said Azizullah, 54, died instantly when an explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated at his home. His wife, Shaikhzad Bibi, 50, and daughter-in-law, Raj Bibi, 22, were injured in the blast. The police quoted Saadullah as saying that the explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated, resulting in the death of his father Azizullah.
The injured were taken to hospital by the villagers. Police have registered case under relevant sections of law in the city police station and launched investigation.

• Prisoners’ families tell Witkoff Israeli govt won’t end war ‘willingly’
• Israel’s top general denies widespread starvation
GAZA: As Palestinians across Gaza Strip struggled for food, Israeli bombardment in the territory continued on Saturday with at least 30 more deaths.
Among them were 13 aid seekers. The UN human rights office in the Palestinian territories said  at least 1,373 Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza had been killed since  May 27.
On the other hand, seven more people, including one child, have died due to “famine and malnutrition” in Gaza, the territory’s health ministry said, bringing the number of deaths from starvation to 169, including 93 children.
The amount of aid entering Gaza remains  “very insufficient” despite a limited improvement, the German government said on Saturday after ministers discussed ways to heighten pressure on Israel.
 
 

The criticism came after Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited the region on Thursday and Friday and the German military staged its first food airdrops into Gaza, where aid agencies say that more than two million Palestinians are facing starvation.
Germany  “notes limited initial progress in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the population of the Gaza Strip, which, however, remains very insufficient to alleviate the emergency situation,” government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in a statement.
 
 

Israeli forces attacks have killed at least 60,430 people and wounded 148,722 since October 2023, besides displacing millions of Palestinians in Gaza. A total of 898 Israeli soldiers have also been killed, according to the military.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that Saturday’s bombings mostly targeted the areas near the southern city of Khan Yunis and Gaza City in the north. He said two people were killed and another 26 injured after an Israeli strike on a central Gaza area where  Palestinians had gathered before a food distribution point run by the  US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
US envoy Steve Witkoff visited a GHF site for five hours on Friday, promising that Trump would come up with a plan to better feed civilians.
Israeli families want end to war
US envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday met the anguished families of Israeli prisoners, as fears for their survival mounted amid the Israeli bombardment across Gaza.
Witkoff was greeted with some applause and pleas for assistance from hundreds of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, before going into a closed meeting with the families.
Videos shared online showed Witkoff arriving as families chanted  “Bring them home!” and  “We need your help.”
Yotam Cohen, brother of 21-year-old Israeli prisoner Nimrod Cohen, told AFP in the square:  “The war needs to end. The Israeli government will not end it willingly. It has refused to do so. The Israeli government must be stopped. For our sake, for our soldiers’ sake, for our prisoners’ sake, for our sons and for the future generations of everybody in the Middle East.”
But Israel’s top general warned that there would be no respite in fighting in Gaza if the prisoners were not released. “I estimate that in the coming days we will know whether we can reach an agreement” for the release of prisoners, said army chief of staff Lt-Gen Eyal Zamir, according to a military statement.
“If not, the combat will continue without rest,” he said, during remarks to officers inside Gaza.
The Israeli general denied that there was widespread starvation in Gaza. “The current campaign of false accusations of intentional starvation is a deliberate, timed, and deceitful attempt to accuse the IDF (Israeli military) … of war crimes,” he said.

In a statement on Saturday, PTI CIS lashed out at the government for labelling the PTI founder’s sons as foreigners. He made it clear that they were Pakistani nationals who possessed National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOPs), and therefore have every legal and constitutional right to visit Pakistan and see their father.
 
 

“The oppressive and tyrannical government was forced to lie out of fear of Imran Khan’s children coming to Pakistan, which shows how weak and cowardly they are,” Mr Waqas stated.
He emphasised that both were issued tracking numbers for their visa applications submitted to the Pakistan High Commission in London — with Sulaiman’s tracking ID being 88005575178 and Kasim’s 88005575782.

Asserts both are Pakistanis, shares details of visa, NICOP applications

He said applications for both visas and NICOPs have been submitted, and while the issuance of NICOPs may take several weeks from Pakistan, visas can be granted within a matter of hours.
The high commissioner intimated a friend of Mr Khan’s family, who spoke to him that he needed clearance from the Ministry of Interior, the PTI leader claimed.
He said the boys were contacting the embassy through normal routes, and there was no response.
The interior ministry in an official statement claimed it had nothing to do with visa issuance. Then the government claimed, “visa applications have not been received”, he remarked.
The party leader also formally released details about NICOP status of Kasim and Sulaiman as issued by the government.

• Below average inflows in Jhelum mean water in reservoir increases only a few inches each day
LAHORE: Despite record rainfall and flooding in rivers, experts have warned of a 25 per cent water shortage in a few months due to a significant decline in Jehlum River’s inflows.
The drop in inflows has also slowed the filling of the Mangla Dam, one of the country’s two biggest reservoirs.
Inflows in the Jhelum River on Saturday dropped to 25,200 cusecs, 47 per cent less than its recorded average. On the corresponding day last year, the inflows were 39,700 cusecs.
The last five-year average for the day was 47,900 cusecs and 44,200 cusecs for the last 10 years.
Due to lesser inflows, water in the Mangla dam was only increasing a few inches each day. According to water experts, this could result in a 25pc water shortage in the coming Rabi season.
From Thursday to Friday, the dam’s storage only increased from 1,200.65 feet to 1,201.20 feet, 41ft below the total capacity of 1,242 feet.
Currently, the dam is holding 4.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its total live capacity of 7.3MAF.
The loss of 3MAF water would translate into up to 12 to 15 per cent water shortages in the coming Rabi season.
Adding the permanent water loss of eight to 10pc due to the reduced capacity of the Tarbela Dam — as a result of silt accumulation — the country is expected to suffer 20 to 25pc water loss during the next Rabi season, according to experts.
According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) data, all but one river yielded less water than they did last year.
The data from April 1 to July 31 showed the Indus River produced 37.20MAF water, which is 31pc higher than its 10-year average and 36pc more than last year.
During the same period, the Kabul River yielded 8.2MAF water, 36pc less than its 10-year average and 53pc less than last year.
The Chenab River nearly maintained its average yield with 10.70MAF water, still 6pc less than the 10-year average but 3pc more than last year.
In total, the Jehlum river produced 8.7MAF water in the last four months. It was 27pc less than the last year and 28pc less than the 10-year average.
Tensions between India and Pakistan since early May have also affected water inflows in the Mangla Dam.
India has stopped sharing river inflows data since April when it unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty.
Irsa Spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana has said almost half a million acre feet of water had to be released from Mangla Dam to cover for the uncertainty created by India’s decision.
“On May 5, inflows in the Chenab river dropped from 35,000 cusecs to mere 5,000 within 24 hours.
Similarly, on May 31, it dipped from 45,000 to a paltry 7,000 cusecs,“ Mr Rana added.
Earlier, on April 5, inflows dropped from  10,000 to 4,000 cusecs.
To cover for these inconsistencies and ensure smooth irrigation of crops, Irsa released additional water from the Mangla Dam, Mr Rana said, adding these factors apparently slowed the reservoir’s filling.
“Normally, we get two to three late showers every monsoon, which helps Mangla dam filling,” he said, adding the downpour didn’t happen this year and there was no forecast for one in the near future.

ISLAMABAD: India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India in May, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.
India’s defence and foreign ministries did not return requests for comment about the intelligence mistakes. Delhi hasn’t acknowledged a Rafale being shot down, but France’s air chief told reporters in June that he had seen evidence of the loss of that fighter and two other aircraft flown by India, including a Russian-made Sukhoi. A top Dassault executive also told French lawmakers that month that India had lost a Rafale in operations, though he didn’t have specific details.
Account of aerial battle
Reuters spoke to eight Pakistani and two Indian officials to piece together an account of the aerial battle, which marked the start of four days of fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours that caused alarm in Washington. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.
Not only did Islamabad have the element of surprise with its missiles’ range, the Pakistani and Indian officials said, but it managed to more efficiently connect its military hardware to surveillance on the ground and in the air, providing it with a clearer picture of the battlefield. Such networks, known as “kill chains,” have become a crucial element of modern warfare.
Four Pakistani officials said they created a “kill chain,” or a multi-domain operation, by linking air, land and space sensors. The network included a Pakistani-developed system, Data Link 17, which connected Chinese military hardware with other equipment, including a Swedish-made surveillance plane, two Pakistani officials said.
The system allowed the J-10s flying closer to India to obtain radar feeds from the surveillance plane cruising further away, meaning the Chinese-made fighters could turn their radars off and fly undetected, according to experts. Pakistan’s military did not respond to requests for comment on this point.
Delhi is trying to set up a similar network, the Indian officials said, adding that their process was more complicated because the country sourced aircraft from a wide range of exporters.
Retired UK air marsahl Greg Bagwell, now a fellow at RUSI, said the episode didnt conclusively prove the superiority of either Chinese or Western air assets but it showed the importance of having the right information and using it.
The winner in this was the side that had the best situational awareness, said Mr Bagwell.
Change in tactics
After India in the early hours of May 7 struck targets in Pakistan that it called terrorist infrastructure, the PAF chief ordered his squadrons to switch from defence to attack.
Five PAF officials said India had deployed some 70 planes, which was more than they had expected and provided Islamabad’s PL-15s with a target-rich environment. India has not said how many planes were used.
Five Pakistani officials said an electronic assault on Indian sensors and communications systems reduced the situational awareness of the Rafale’s pilots.
The two Indian officials said the Rafales were not blinded during the skirmishes and that Indian satellites were not jammed. But they acknowledged that Pakistan appeared to have disrupted the Sukhoi, whose systems Delhi is now upgrading.
In the aftermath of the episode, India’s deputy army chief Lt. Gen. Rahul Singh accused Pakistan of receiving live inputs from China during the battles, implying radar and satellite feeds.
He did not provide evidence and Islamabad denies the allegation.
Beijing’s air chief Lt Gen Wang Gang, however, visited Pakistan in July to discuss how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put together the “kill chain for the Rafale, two PAF officials said.
The Pakistani military said in a statement in July that Wang had expressed “keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in Multi Domain Operations.”
The hour-long fight, which took place in darkness, involved some 110 aircraft, experts estimate, making it the world’s largest air battle in decades. The J-10 jets shot down at least one Rafale, Reuters reported in May, citing the US officials.
Its downing surprised many in the military community and raised questions about the effectiveness of Western military hardware against untested Chinese alternatives. Shares of Dassault, which makes the Rafale, dipped after reports that the fighter had been shot down.

Authorities from both sides, through military channels, subsequently coordinated to establish the boy’s identity and facilitate the repatriation.

Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region. A day after he and his party came out all guns blazing against the military offensive, CM Gand­apur had appea­red to throw his full weight behind a “targeted operation” against militants. His statement came in complete contrast to the one issued on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.
Though CM Gandapur took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, had denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.
In a message from Imran posted today on his X account, which is not operated by him, the ex-premier said regarding any operation in KP: “I convey a clear message to Ali Amin that the federation must not be allowed to conduct another military operation in KP and the tribal areas.
“Confrontation between the army and the people destroys the institution of the army. Operations are not a solution to any problem. Issues should be resolved through dialogue in accordance with the system there. Afghanistan is our Muslim neighbouring country. Relations with them should also be improved, and issues should be addressed through discussions.”
Responding to the party founder’s instruction from his personal account, Gandapur said that keeping in mind Imran’s thinking, he had hosted today the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.
 






Gandapur had announced earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.
It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.
 






The statement added that the CM’s adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.
The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.
“Tribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,” the statement added.
The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.
No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.
“Immediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-08-02 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02224129513b81e.png?r=224333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928297/karachi-police-book-8-suspects-under-terror-murder-charges-for-gunning-down-senior-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police book 8 suspects under terror, murder charges for gunning down senior lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The Darakshan Police on Saturday registered a case against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges for killing senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam and critically injuring his young son inside a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority a day prior.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza had told Dawn.com on Friday that the firing took place after prayers at a mosque in DHA Phase 6. “As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG had said.
The Darakshan Police registered a first information report (FIR) today upon the complaint of the victim’s brother and under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“My brother Khawaja Shamsul Islam, along with his two young sons and two guards had gone to offer Friday prayers and attend funeral prayers at the Quran Academy mosque located on Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase 6,” the FIR read.
“He was picking up his slippers at the staircase of the mosque when [the suspect] fired two shots at around 2:30pm. As a result, one bullet hit my brother and another hit his son. The suspect managed to escape while taking advantage of the rush.”
The complainant added that the victim’s younger son was unharmed in the incident and took his injured father to a private hospital in Clifton, while unidentified persons took the injured son to another private hospital in the same locale.
“Khawaja Shamsul Islam expired during treatment while his son was admitted with critical injuries,” the FIR added.
The complainant alleged that the primary suspect, along with 15-20 accomplices, attacked the lawyer last November, in which he was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.
“Now, the suspect, his two brothers and five other suspects attacked together … resulting in the death of the lawyer and serious injuries to his son,” the complainant stated, adding that the incident also triggered fear and chaos among the general public.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the nominated suspects over terrorism, murder charges and criminal conspiracy.
DIG Raza also told Dawn.com, “The prime suspect has confessed to the crime in a recorded video message.”
On Friday, the DIG constituted a special team under the supervision of the South senior superintendent of police to arrest the suspects who murdered the advocate and injured his son.
He had added that the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past, as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members would not appear before any court today to express solidarity with the slain senior lawyer.</p><small>2025-08-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02225241975f13f.jpg?r=225258' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928298/police-arrest-suspect-for-allegedly-killing-female-cousin-over-honour-in-kps-shangla' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest suspect for allegedly killing female cousin over ‘honour’ in KP’s Shangla</strong></a><br><p>The police arrested a suspect on Saturday for allegedly killing his female cousin over ‘honour’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district.
Bisham Station House Officer Syed Khurshid Ali told Dawn.com the incident occurred in the Bobai area of Bisham tehsil on Friday. The first information report of the incident was filed at the Bisham Police Station on the complaint of the victim’s father a day ago under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant said he was at home at 8pm when his daughter went out to the toilet and he soon heard gunshots, adding that upon going out, he spotted his nephew with a weapon and axing his daughter. He further said that his daughter was taking her last breaths when he reached her.
The father said his daughter had been married for three years and had a young child.
Talking to Dawn.com, SHO Syed Khurshid Ali said: “The suspect was arrested today. Initially, the FIR was lodged under Section 302, but it will later be switched to Section 311 (honour killing) as the incident was related to honour [killing].”
The SHO added: “The cousin was suspecting that the victim had gone outside to meet someone and was in an illicit relationship.”
He said an investigation was being initiated into the incident.
A couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district, police said on Wednesday.
The incident occurred over a week after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
Last week, a man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the Degari case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-08-02 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02194041e5bd2c0.jpg?r=194154' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928257/iran-president-lands-in-islamabad-for-2-day-visit-eyeing-to-boost-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president lands in Islamabad for 2-day visit, eyeing to boost trade ties</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.
Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office said. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday pledged to help defuse tensions between Iran and the United States.
Dr Pezeshkian arrived at Nur Khan Air Base, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar received him.
 






PM Shehbaz said he was honoured to welcome the Iranian president and looked forward to “substantive engagements during this important visit that will pave the way forward for stronger Pakistan-Iran ties”.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited the Foreign Office, where he met FM Dar and the two held discussions.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties, with a focus on expanding cooperation in regional stability, trade, and economic collaboration. They also discussed enhancing bilateral engagement across key areas of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






FM Dar said the two had productive discussions on all areas of mutual interest, including trade, economic cooperation, regional and international developments. “Looking forward to substantive talks at the leadership level tomorrow.”
 






The FO said both held preliminary discussions on key substantive issues to be addressed at the leadership level, including regional developments, bilateral trade and connectivity, energy cooperation, and the need to strengthen mechanisms for regular consultation and coordination.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the longstanding and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Iran. They also emphasised the importance of sustained dialogue, enhanced cooperation on economic and security matters, and greater people-to-people exchanges.”
 






Dr Pezeshkian arrived earlier in Lahore, where PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz received him.
 


He visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal to pay tribute to his legacy with CM Maryam, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari accompanying him.
President Pezeshkian laid a wreath at the grave and offered prayers, led by Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad.
The Iranian president also penned remarks in the visitors’ book, expressing admiration for Allama Iqbal’s contributions to Islamic philosophy and the Pakistan Movement.
Tight security arrangements were in place to ensure the safety of him and his delegation throughout the visit.

PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his visit to Iran in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India.
Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had visited the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a helicopter crash.
According to Iran’s state media IRNA, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had agreed in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.
The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.
“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.
Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to IRNA.
 
 

Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.
Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent Israel-Iran war and the United States’ strikes against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that strongly condemned this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.
According to IRNA, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.
Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.

In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order. Last month, the Quetta ATC handed the BYC chief and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days.
Advocates Israr Baloch, Shoaib Baloch and Awais Zehri appeared on behalf of the BYC leadership in today’s hearing, presided over by ATC Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen. Israr told Dawn.com that Mahrang, Beebow Baloch and Gulzadi were present in court.
“Dr Mahrang and the other BYC members’ remand was approved. They were handed over to police custody for 20 days,” he said, adding that the police had requested that they be remanded for 30 days.
In a post on X, Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch slammed the extension of remand and said that not only did it violate the fundamental principles of justice, but illustrated a “highly dangerous judicial trend”.
“The court’s decision … is not merely an illegal action but also a reflection of the bitter reality that Pakistan’s judiciary, particularly in Balochistan, has been stripped of its freedom and autonomy,” she wrote.
“The court’s actions — sometimes transferring the case to the Home Department, sometimes dismissing it — are all indicative of constitutional, legal, and moral bankruptcy.”
Sammi noted that the judiciary in Balochistan did not offer justice, reflecting a mindset from the colonial era.
“It is time for the judiciary to recognise its constitutional role, fulfil its duty to protect civil liberties and fundamental rights, and distance itself from this game of oppression,” she wrote.
 






The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
On July 8, a Quetta ATC handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody for 10 days, extending their detention. The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority, Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court in May.</p><small>2025-08-02 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0217251019eb92f.png?r=174311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928267/pm-shehbaz-orders-separate-airport-immigration-counters-for-foreigners-to-boost-tourism-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz orders separate airport immigration counters for foreigners to boost tourism, investment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday ordered the establishment of separate immigration counters at all international airports to facilitate foreign passengers and boost tourism and investment.
A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said the decision was taken to “promote tourism in the country, ensure continuity of business activities and facilitate foreign investment”.
It added that the establishment of the counters would reduce the immigration processing time at the airports.
The statement also said that Pakistanis returning to the country would be able to complete their immigration process in a shorter time after the establishment of separate and designated counters for foreigners.
“The initiative is part of a strategy to make Pakistan more attractive and friendly for global tourists, investors, and business delegations,” the PMO said.

Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told Dawn.com that the children found the mortar shell in the field and took it to their village, Sorband, thinking it was a toy.
“The shell exploded, resulting in the deaths of five children and leaving 12 others critically injured,” he said. “The deceased and injured children have been transported to Khalifa Gul Nawaz hospital,” the spokesperson said, adding that the injured children were being provided medical treatment in the emergency ward.
A statement issued by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said he visited the hospital to enquire about the condition of the injured.
“He checked on their condition, encouraged them and met with hospital administration to review the provision of treatment, availability of medicines, and other medical facilities in detail.”
It added that the Bomb Disposal Squad arrived at the scene, collected evidence and initiated an investigation.
According to the statement, the RPO vowed that all possible assistance would be provided to the affected families and those responsible would soon be brought to justice. RPO Khan also met with the relatives of the injured and assured them of full support.
Children playing with explosives, thinking they are toys, is not a new phenomenon.
In October 2023, a child lost his life while eight others were injured when a hand grenade exploded in the Zarchain area of Balochistan’s Wadh city.
The month before, nine people, including four children, lost their lives while a woman was injured when a “rocket launcher’s” ordnance exploded in a house in Sindh’s Kashmore district.</p><small>2025-08-02 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02163348f281a84.png?r=164041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928259/bangladesh-to-unveil-democratic-overhauls-on-revolution-anniversary' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh to unveil democratic overhauls on revolution anniversary</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s interim government said on Saturday it will release its slate of democratic overhauls on August 5, the one-year anniversary of the overthrow of the previous autocratic administration.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since a student-led revolt ousted then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, 2024, ending her 15-year rule.
Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has said he inherited a “completely broken down” system of public administration.
Yunus previously pledged to unveil a “big package” to overhaul democratic institutions.
But efforts to reach agreements have made slow progress as political parties jostle for power ahead of elections, slated for early 2026.
Yunus’s government has warned that political power struggles risk jeopardising the gains that have been made.
On July 29, Yunus said he was working to “build a broad national consensus around a renewed political system — one that delivers inclusive, participatory, and credible elections”.
Yunus’s office said on Saturday that the “July Proclamation” would be “presented to the nation … in the presence of all political parties involved in the mass uprising”.
Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.
Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, staging lopsided elections and dismantling democratic checks on its power.
Hasina, 77, fled to India, where she has defied court orders to attend her ongoing trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity.
Protests began on July 1, 2024, with university students calling for reforms to a quota system for public sector jobs.
They culminated on August 5, 2024, when thousands of protesters stormed Hasina’s palace as she escaped by helicopter.</p><small>2025-08-02 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0215484549efbc8.jpg?r=161158' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928258/viral-video-of-passenger-slapping-muslim-man-on-indian-flight-sparks-social-media-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video of passenger slapping Muslim man on Indian flight sparks social media outrage</strong></a><br><p>A passenger slapping a Muslim fellow traveller on an Indian flight sparked outrage on social media when a video of the incident went viral, Indian news outlet Hindustan Times reported on Friday.
Discrimination against Muslims in India has spiked in recent months, amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
According to the Hindustan Times, the passengers were on board IndiGo flight 6E138 from Mumbai to Kolkata.
“The victim appeared to be unwell and was receiving assistance from the cabin crew when another passenger suddenly slapped him without any provocation,” it reported.
The Times of India said that the victim, a Muslim man, had a panic attack, “began sobbing and walking the aisle requesting to de-board as the aircraft taxied, when another flyer struck him”.
A video clip circulating online showed the victim in visible distress after being hit. Another passenger could be heard asking, “Why did you slap him? You don’t have the right to hit anybody, do you understand?”
A crew member was also heard telling the accused, “Don’t do that.”
 






The reason behind the assault remains unknown for now, and investigations are ongoing. However, the video sparked outrage across social media, with many calling for strict action against the attacker.
The consensus across social media was that the victim had been hit because he was a “visible Muslim”, causing the conversation to turn to slamming “hate politics” and religious divides.
According to the Hindustan Times, one user on X wrote, “This isn’t society collapsing, it’s decades of hate politics finally reaching cruising altitude.”
Another commented, “What level of harassment and abuse is this? Just slapping a guy because he was a visible Muslim? What action have you taken against him? He should be behind bars and banned from travelling.”
Another comment said, “What right does that person have to hit anyone? Pathetic!”
Attacker handed over to authorities
Upon landing in Kolkata, the attacker was handed over to security personnel at the airport. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took the individual into custody for further investigation.
IndiGo condemned the incident and confirmed that it would initiate action under unruly flyer rules, which may include a temporary no-fly ban. The airline emphasised its commitment to passenger safety and respectful conduct on all flights.
The airline declared the individual as “unruly” and stated that relevant aviation security agencies had been informed in line with protocol.
IndiGo said in a post on X, “Such unruly behaviour is completely unacceptable, and we strongly condemn any actions that compromise the safety and dignity of our passengers and crew.”
The airline added, “We remain committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment on all our flights.”
 






In May, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8 in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
The White House, India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India starting August 1 along with additional penalties, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy.
Trump indicated in a Truth Social post that India would face additional penalties for the purchase of Russian arms and oil. However, he later said that he did not care what India does with Russia.
 


On Friday, Trump told reporters that he had heard that India would no longer be buying oil from Russia.
 
 

Two senior Indian officials said there had been no change in policy, according to the NYT report, which added that one official said the government had “not given any direction to oil companies” to cut back imports from Russia.
Reuters had earlier reported that Indian state refiners stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed in July.
On July 14, Trump threatened 100pc tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine. Russia is the top supplier to India, responsible for about 35pc of India’s overall supplies.
On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.</p><small>2025-08-02 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/021428459b2bc66.png?r=145045' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928254/pakistan-and-kyrgyzstan-agree-to-boost-cooperation-in-cryptocurrency' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan agree to boost cooperation in cryptocurrency</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance, state-run Pakistan Television (PTV) reported on Saturday.
The Pakistani government has lately seemed willing to fast-track the adoption of crypto currencies for banks, foreign exchange comp­anies and gold trading. In March, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched, which was a government-backed initiative to regulate, foster, and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency innovations into the country’s financial and economic framework.
“A high-level video conference was held between Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal bin Saqib and Director of the National Investment Agency of Kyrgyzstan Farukht Aminov,” acccording to PTV.
“Both sides emphasised the development of virtual assets, technology exchange, and cooperation in regulatory frameworks,” it added.
The Kyrgyz director highlighted the importance of exchanging information, experiences and best global practices.
Bilal bin Saqib said Kyrgyzstan can become a key partner in innovation and regulation in digital assets. He described Pak-Kyrgyz relations as a strong foundation in the digital economy of the future.
The two countries also discussed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for formal cooperation in the crypto sector. The participants expressed their commitment to continue bilateral cooperation for the establishment of a secure, transparent and modern digital economy.
The participants of the video conference also agreed that there is a need for regional partnerships to promote blockchain and digital finance in Central and South Asia.
In July, President  Asif Ali Zardari had approved the “Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025” to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor has also previously lauded Pakistan’s efforts to move towards cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p><small>2025-08-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0214003519122ed.png?r=140429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928116/over-20-brands-of-drinking-water-unsafe-for-human-consumption' target='_blank'><strong>Over 20 brands of drinking water unsafe for human consumption</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) on Friday declared 23 brands unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
The government of Pakistan had tasked PCRWR with monitoring bottled/mineral water brands on quarterly basis and publicize the results for awareness of public health.
For the second quarter of year 2025 from April to June, 203 samples of mineral/bottled water brands were collected from 21 major cities. Comparison of test results with the bottled water quality standards of Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) had revealed that 23 brands were unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
Eleven brands such as New Mehran, Aqua 111, Nice Pure Max, Pure Drinking Water, Logic, Himalya Cool, Natural Pure Life, Natural, Forever Bottled Drinking Water, Drinkly Pure Drinking Water, Qudrat Water were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of sodium.
Four brands — Atco Drinking Water, Aqua nest, Pani, New Mountain — were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of arsenic.
 
 

One brand labelled Vey Forever was found unsafe due to the presence of a high level of potassium than the permissible limit.
Nine other brands, such as Noble Pure Drinking Water, Aqua 111, Clear, Wah Water, Nice Pure Max, Aqua King bottled water, Maa jee, Freshin drinking water and Iceland, were found contaminated with bacteria and thus were unsafe for drinking purposes.
PCRWR said that the general public was encouraged to look at the detailed report to know about the status of water quality of bottled water brands they consume.

Floods swept across GB last week, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said today that a search operation on Babusar Highway is under way during which many vehicles that were swept away by the floods have been recovered.
“The vehicles were found but we found no clue as to the missing persons,” he said in a statement.
Faraq continued that rehabilitation work has been accelerated in the flood-affected areas.
He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would be visiting GB in two or three days. “Hopefully, the prime minister’s visit will provide relief to the injured victims.”
PM Shehbaz yesterday expressed his aim to visit GB in solidarity with the affected people. He reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in the flood-hit areas in a high-level meeting that focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
 






“Water and electricity have been restored in many areas of the region,” the spokesperson said, adding that communication systems on Babusar Highway and other places have also been restored.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Yesterday, a glacier burst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person when a father and son fell into a ravine and were buried under the debris of the glacier.
More cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts on Thursday.
Last week, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02131046d5c0f03.png?r=132544' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928249/spacex-crew-dragon-docks-with-international-space-station' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with International Space Station</strong></a><br><p>An international team of four astronauts aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked on Saturday with the orbiting International Space Station (ISS).
“Docking confirmed!”, SpaceX posted on social media, along with a video showing the spacecraft making contact with the ISS at 2:27am Eastern Time (11:27am PKT), far above the southeast Pacific Ocean.
American astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan’s Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov are joining the ISS on a six-month mission.
They lifted off on Friday morning from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, their capsule mounted on a Falcon 9 rocket.
It is the 11th crew rotation mission to the ISS under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Programme, created to succeed the Space Shuttle era by partnering with private industry.
 






 






“We have cold drinks, hot food, and us waiting — see you soon,” the ISS crew told the new arrivals shortly after contact, according to the posted video.
“Hello Space Station — Crew 11 is here and we are super excited to join,” Fincke replied.
As part of their stay, the Crew-11 astronauts will simulate moon landing scenarios that could be encountered near the lunar South Pole under the US-led Artemis programme.
Using handheld controllers and multiple display screens, they will test how shifts in gravity affect astronauts’ ability to pilot spacecraft, including future lunar landers.
 
 

Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS functions as a testbed for research that supports deeper space exploration — including eventual missions to Mars.
Among Crew-11’s more colourful cargo items are Armenian pomegranate seeds, which will be compared to a control batch kept on Earth to study how microgravity influences crop growth.
The ISS is set to be decommissioned after 2030, with its orbit gradually lowered until it breaks up in the atmosphere over a remote part of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, a spacecraft graveyard.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0212083860ceec5.png?r=120933' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928244/pakistan-army-inducts-z-10me-helicopters-to-reinforce-battlefield-response' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army inducts Z-10ME helicopters to ‘reinforce battlefield response’</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Army has inducted Z-10ME attack helicopters to reinforce its “integrated battlefield response”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday.
The Aviation Industry Corporation of China had displayed its Z-10 attack helicopter for the first time outside its home country at the Singapore Airshow in February 2024, according to Reuters. It also noted that as of then, the model had Pakistan as the only known export customer, but no sales had been announced at the air show.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir presided over the induction ceremony and later witnessed a firepower demonstration by the “newly inducted Z-10ME helicopters” at the Muzaffargarh Field Firing Ranges, the ISPR said in a press release, without specifying the number of the craft acquired.
“The induction of this potent system marks a major leap in the modernisation of Army Aviation, reinforcing its integrated battlefield response and capacity to deliver decisive effects against potential adversaries,” the military’s media affairs wing noted.
 


In 2021, Defense News reported that China sent three of its Z-10 helicopter gunships for trials in Pakistan, but they failed to sufficiently impress officials and were returned.
However, former Australian defence attaché to Islamabad, Brian Cloughley, had said it was “likely that the Pakistan Army will evaluate the Chinese Z-10ME attack helicopter”.
The ISPR highlighted: “This state-of-the-art, all-weather platform is capable of precision strike operations day and night.
“Equipped with advanced radar systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare suites, the Z-10ME significantly enhances the army’s capability to engage diverse aerial and ground threats.”
Interacting with troops at the Muzaffargarh firing ranges, COAS Munir lauded their exceptional morale, professionalism, and combat proficiency.
He appreciated the “successful demonstration of combined arms tactics, reflecting the army’s firm resolve to maintain a decisive edge in the evolving character of warfare”.
Separately, Field Marshal Munir stressed the importance of national unity and civil-military synergy in countering “hybrid threats”.
 
 

He made the remarks as he engaged with members of academia and civil society during an interactive session, following his visit to Multan Garrison.
“He underscored the significance of national unity, civil-military synergy and a whole-of-nation approach in countering hybrid threats and fostering societal cohesion,” the ISPR statement read.
At the garrison, COAS Munir was briefed on the formation’s operational preparedness and ongoing training activities, the report added. He reaffirmed the army’s “unwavering commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
The army chief expressed satisfaction over the high standards of readiness.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:00</small></div><hr>
