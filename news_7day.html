Gaza, he declared, had become a “graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law”.
Presiding over the UNSC’s quarterly open debate on the Palestinian question, Mr Dar condemned what he described as a “genocide in full view of the international community — one that the UN seems unable or unwilling to stop”. It was a rare moment of moral clarity in a chamber that has too often offered empty words while an entire people are being systematically starved, bombed and erased. Indeed, Gaza today is a “nightmare of historic proportions”, in the words of Khaled Khiari, the UN assistant secretary general for the Middle East.
Over 59,000 Palestinians have been killed. Aid convoys are shelled. UN schools and hospitals are reduced to rubble. A third of Gaza’s population is reportedly going days without food. Just this week, the Palestinian envoy recounted the deaths of two children — one just six weeks old — from starvation. “Children in Gaza are not starving,” he said, “they are being starved.” Yet the UN has failed to act decisively.
Mr Dar rightly described the situation as a “litmus test” for the credibility of the UN and the international order. The UNSC’s inaction — paralysed by geopolitical alignments and veto politics — is not mere indifference; it is complicity. Each day of delay costs lives. It emboldens impunity. It makes a mockery of international humanitarian law.
Pakistan’s six-point plan — calling for an unconditional ceasefire, full humanitarian access, support for UNRWA, an end to illegal settlements and forced displacement, a reconstruction framework, and a genuine two-state solution — reflects what the global consensus should be.
Against this backdrop, efforts towards a ceasefire are teetering. Hamas has reportedly given a “positive and flexible” response to a US-backed 60-day truce proposal, agreeing to Israeli troop withdrawals and UN-supervised aid corridors. Mediators — including Qatar, Egypt and the US — remain engaged.
However, Israel has recalled its negotiators from Doha for consultations, signalling unease over Hamas’s conditions, especially guarantees that fighting will not resume once the truce expires. Israel also insists on maintaining a limited military presence. Despite these differences, diplomatic channels remain open — but time is quickly running out.
The horror unfolding in Gaza is a collapse of the very global norms the UN was founded to uphold. The Paris peace conference, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, may present a diplomatic opening, but it cannot be a substitute for immediate and forceful action. The UN’s moral failure in Rwanda and Bosnia must not be repeated in Gaza. This time, the world must not look away.

In fact, the poor and powerless are the worst sufferers of a constitutionally degenerated order — mainly resulting from the failure of both the political leadership and the judiciary.
Barring some exceptions, the political leadership has largely played a deplorable role in the history of our democratic struggle. Both democracy and the people’s rights and liberties have been sacrificed at the altar of personal and political benefits. In many cases, ‘people’s power’ has been leveraged to get a better ‘deal’ from powerful quarters. Ideology and morality have given way to the consolidation of dynastic politics, again motivated by the relentless pursuit of power and pelf.
One or the other among the mainstream leadership has lent a shoulder to non-democratic forces at critical junctures of constitutional struggle. Until some years ago, the PTI-led coalition upheld the hybrid regime, acting as the junior adjunct of the establishment-dominated dispensation, while the opposition — particularly the PML-N and PPP —was mercilessly persecuted. The shoe is now on the other foot; the PTI is being battered by the PML-PPP coalition ostensibly at the behest of the powers that be.
The latter’s alternating cycle of conflict and conciliation with one or the other component of the political leadership has over the years crystallised into what has aptly come to be described as a hybrid regime — a combination of authoritarianism and plutocracy. Dominated by non-political influential quarters, it also includes an array of other forces — compliant politicians, ambitious elements in the judiciary, crony capitalists, landed interests and a highly politicised bureaucracy. These elites hold the handles of power, and can also be charged with appropriating much of the national wealth and resources, keeping the majority of the populace out of the politico-economic calculus.
It is no wonder then that 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line; every third child is out of school in this age of AI; three out of four persons are deprived of clean drinking water and sanitation; and millions live in appalling conditions in squatter settlements. Social disparity has also touched new heights. Pakistan’s top 1pc monopolises more wealth than the bottom 70pc, while 42pc of the country’s income is earned by the top 10pc of households; the bottom 50pc earn only 13pc. Yet, the minimum wage remains almost unchanged even during inflation. In contrast, the salaries and allowances of the top functionaries — judges, parliamentarians, the military brass and senior bureaucracy — have been substantially raised. Likewise, the industrial, financial and propertied classes also regularly receive generous subsidies and tax exemptions.

Who will or should protect the citizenry against state capture by a selfish elite?

Thus, the elitist state has, for ages now, ‘abandoned’ the masses — millions of jobless, underpaid, landless, homeless, marginalised, disenfranchised and caste-religion-gender-battered people. Many of the jobless youth are taking to drugs and even dying by suicide. Except for handing some periodic cash transfers to the poorest communities to garner support, the state and political elites are not willing to share the common wealth and resources with the people. Instead, the latter’s democratic voice and peaceful protests are met with force on the pretext of ‘national security’ and the maintenance of order. Interestingly, certain elements have lately started highlighting the tragic plight of the people caught up in the war-torn states in the Middle East and Africa, expecting to earn the people’s gratitude for keeping this country ‘safe’ and ‘unified’.
This raises questions: the country may be safe, but for whom? Are the common men and women safe — physically, economically, environmentally, socially, politically? Or, are they at the mercy of criminals, terrorists, inept and corrupt public functionaries, crony capitalists and retrogressive feudal-tribal forces? How is the country ‘unified’ when there exists a plethora of fault lines — social, political, ethnic, sectarian, regional, institutional and civil-military? Only a small and close-knit group of elites is unified, bonded by their common interest in keeping the current exploitative politico-legal order alive.
Against such a reality, the question that arises is: who will or should protect the citizenry against state capture by a selfish elite? The first responders in such situations are always the judges, who are regarded as the custodians of citizens’ fundamental rights, and are bound by their oath to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution. Aggrieved people — those who pay taxes, direct and indirect — go to the courts to seek redress against the wrongs committed by errant public functionaries. The annals of democratic struggles are replete with instances of the glorious role played by judges in support of the rule of law, particularly in India, America and Britain.
Unfortunately, in our case, with the exception of some courageous and independent-minded judges, the overall performance of our judiciary has been dismal in the context of the constitutional struggle. In fact, some of the saddest episodes of the continuing constitutional debacle have been overseen jointly by opportunistic politicians and ambitious judges, with the latter often providing authoritarian and rigged systems with legal and political crutches to prop them up. The 26th Amendment is a recent instance of the dubious role played by them. They have helped the powers that be create a ‘super executive’ at the cost of judicial independence, integrity and collegiality. Predictably, the newly created Constitutional Bench has already passed a series of controversial judgements. It has legalised civilians’ trial by military courts, validated the ‘permanent’ transfers of judges from one high court to another, and handed the ruling coalition the game-changing ‘reserved seats’ to further amend the Constitution, thus upgrading the existing hybrid system to, perhaps, ‘hybrid plus’.
Thus, it is clear that the emerging politico-legal order is going to make the rapacious elites all the more extractive and repressive, and yet, immune to accountability, with the hapless people being the easy prey. Until, of course, the wheels of history are turned against them.

They reflect the national vision and priorities.
A general view about budget 2025-26 is that it is a lost opportunity. With some macroeconomic stability and inflation under control, many economists think it was time to prepare a reformist budget. The government should have checked its own expenditure, given relief to the salaried class and reset national priorities.
Today, with almost half of Pakistan’s population below the internationally comparable poverty line and 16.5 per cent living in extreme poverty, and with over 25 million children out of school and 40pc suffering from stunting, it’s not rocket science to work out where the needs are and where public money should be spent. Sadly, it is no wonder that Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has been declining consistently over the last 10 years. We ranked 147 in 2015; according to this year’s report, we’ve plummeted to 168 among 193 countries.
Against this backdrop, let’s look at health budget 2025-26, with the knowledge that Pakistan is among the lowest spenders on health. To put things in perspective, according to the World Bank, domestic general government health expenditure per capita in international dollar terms in 2022 in Pakistan was 68.11; in the same year, it was 475.01 in Iran, 245.91 in Sri Lanka, 623.19 in China, and 106.83 in India. To meaningfully progress towards achieving universal healthcare (UHC), governments need to spend at least 5pc of GDP. Pakistan’s spending hovered around 1pc in 2022, whereas in the same year Iran spent 2.63pc, Sri Lanka 1.76pc, China 2.95pc and India 1.29pc.

Pakistan is among the lowest spenders on health.

At the federal level, the combined non-development and development budget for the Ministry of National Health Services has been cut from Rs54.87 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs46.10bn in FY 2025-26 — a reduction of Rs8.77bn. More importantly, the non-development budget, which mainly goes towards salaries, has been increased from Rs28bn to Rs32bn, whereas the development budget has seen a huge 47pc cut — down from Rs27bn to Rs14bn.
In Balochistan, where needs are dire, the health budget has increased by only 6pc from the previous year to Rs87bn. This is a province with serious political unrest and economic problems, where educated young people have joined the uprising because of lack of opportunities and public services. According to an official estimate, 60pc of primary healthcare facilities in the province are without medical officers, and in some districts up to 75pc of children are not routinely immunised. Of all the provinces, Balochistan is the worst off in terms of UHC Service Coverage Index, which is 40 on the scale of zero to 100. In some districts, it is as low as 18. The SCI is calculated by measuring the coverage of 14 basic health services. In this budget, Rs4.5bn are allocated for the Health Card Programme. There is almost doubling of the budget for PHC in Balochistan in relative terms, which is appreciable.
The KP government has allocated Rs276bn to the health sector in the current budget, which is a 19pc increase from the previous year. The allocation for the Sehat Card Plus programme has been increased from Rs28bn to Rs35bn, with an additional Rs6bn for the merged districts. The programme is universal, with coverage of the broadest spectrum of treatments, even including bone marrow transplants and cochlear implants. The PHC, however, remains underserved in the province. With 80pc of the province’s population living in the rural areas, according to the 2023 census, strengthening PHC in these areas and expanding health insurance to PHC in the private sector should be prioritised. In my view, the Sehat Sahulat programme in KP needs serious rethinking in terms of its universal coverage at the tertiary level and no coverage at the PHC level in the private sector.
The Sindh government has increased its health budget by almost 7pc, from Rs347.57bn to Rs371.87bn. Out of this, the non-development budget is 87.7pc, ie, Rs326.5bn, with only 12.3pc remaining for the development budget, ie, Rs45.37bn. The development budget increase is less than 1pc compared with the previous financial year. Sindh continues with its heavy focus on high-cost tertiary-level care, rather than on low-cost and long-lasting preventive care at the PHC level. Tertiary hospitals, mainly in Karachi, are serving people well, but unless the prevention of diseases becomes a financial priority, we’ll continue to mop the floor. Governance and misuse of allocated funds, for both the recurrent and development budget, continue to be huge challenges for Sindh.
Punjab has substantially increased its health budget to Rs630.5bn from Rs539bn last year — ie, an increase of Rs91.5bn or almost 17pc. Out of this, Rs181bn are for the development budget. While it is an impressive increase, Punjab has three major healthcare issues. First, it continues to spend high amounts on tertiary care and pays relatively less attention to PHC. Secondly, inequity in healthcare is a big issue in the province. Most new schemes are in Lahore, and this time there is a hefty allocation of Rs109bn for the establishment of a medical district in Lahore, which the government call its flagship initiative. According to a district-level analysis in 2024 by the Ministry of National Health Services, per capita government health expenditure in Lahore was above $70, but less than $1 in 24 out of 36 districts in Punjab. These figures speak for themselves. The third issue is that everything in Punjab is unabashedly and heavily politically motivated. Left, right and centre, everything is in the name of the chief minister. There was an attempt even to change the name of the Jinnah Institute of Cardiology, but then better sense apparently prevailed.
Seemingly, there has been increase in the health budget all around, but this is still far less than desired keeping in view the public health crisis in the country and the minimum required to achieve UHC. Our priorities continue to be lopsided in healthcare spending. We are ready to spend heavily on transplants and cancers but not appropriately on preventing non-communicable diseases and organ failures. Last, but not least, governance issues and lack of population control will continue to drown all our efforts, even increasing budgets, to improve health in Pakistan.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported the Indus River at medium flood levels in Kalabagh and Chashma, while Tarbela, Taunsa, Guddu, and Sukkur are experiencing low floods. Flash flood warnings have been issued for hill torrents in DG Khan Division and nullahs of East Balochistan.
In northern Punjab, districts like Sialkot, Gujranwala, and Jhelum have been particularly hard-hit. Gujranwala recorded 82mm of rainfall in People’s Colony, while Sargodha city reported 69mm, exacerbating flood conditions.
Hundreds of families in riverine (Katcha) areas have been forced to vacate as waters inundate villages and destroy crops, especially rice and sugarcane.

The central Punjab, including Mandi Bahauddin (50mm rainfall) and Hafizabad (44mm), faces similar challenges, with relief camps being set up for displaced residents.
The southern Punjab remains on high alert as floodwaters advance toward Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan. The Chenab at Marala is flowing at 115,100 cusecs, while the Ravi at Balloki has reached 38,500 cusecs, posing risks to adjoining areas. The PMD warns of isolated heavy falls in Bahawalpur and DG Khan divisions over the next 24 hours, which could worsen the situation.
The district administrations of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur launched an evacuation campaign due to flooding in hill torrents. Hundreds of families were being relocated to safe places in these districts.
Rescue 1122 said 40 people trapped in a canal at Shinka in Attock district were evacuated. .
Earlier, Lahore witnessed three spells of rain in its different areas. The rain started around 8:45am and continued till 4:30pm with intervals. The rain made movement of the people difficult after causing flooding in streets and major roads of the city.
According to Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa), maximum rain 43 mm was recorded in Iqbal Town, 39 mm at Nishtar Town, 28 mm at Chowk Nakhuda, 26 mm at Samanabad, 22 mm at Wasa head office Gulberg, and less than 20 mm at other areas of the city.
Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) workers were deployed across key areas including Jail Road, Mall Road, Data Darbar, Circular Road, Aik Moria Pul, Do Moria Pul, and McLeod Road to ensure uninterrupted cleaning operations. Over 6,000 waste containers were cleared regularly as part of the ongoing waste collection system, which continued smoothly even during the rain.Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said as many as 143 citizens died, 200 houses were affected and 488 citizens were injured due to monsoon rains in a month.
He said the PDMA arrangements are complete in view of the possible flood threat. “There is a risk of urban flooding due to monsoon rains in Lahore, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Gujranwala.“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the relevant stakeholders to redress the loss of farmers whose crops were badly affected due to flood torrents.
She directed provision of financial assistance to the residents of mud houses which collapsed due to the flood torrents.
Meanwhile, Multan also witnessed heavy rain in different areas of the city. Multan Wasa Director General Khalid Raza Khan imposed a rain emergency. He directed the workers to start efforts to clear all major localities from rain water.

“True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the state of Palestine. I will make a formal announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September,” the French head of state wrote on X and Instagram.
 






Including France, Palestinian statehood is now recognised by 142 countries, though Israel and the United States strongly oppose recognition.
France would be the most significant European power to recognise a Palestinian state.
“The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and rescue the civilian population,” Macron wrote.
“We must finally build the state of Palestine, ensure its viability and enable it, by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, to contribute to the security of all in the Middle East.”
PA welcomes intent
Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas’s deputy,  Hussein al Sheikh, welcomed France’s intent to recognise the state of Palestine, thanking President Macron.
“This position reflects France’s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state,” Sheikh said.

In a presidential statement ado­pted by consensus on Wednesday, the 15-member Council acknowledged OIC’s efforts in coordination with the United Nations.
It hailed OIC’s contributions to “conflict prevention, confidence-building, peacekeeping, conflict resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation, mediation and preventive diplomacy”.
The Council stressed these efforts must remain consistent “with the UN Charter and relevant resolutions of the Council.”

Dar says 57-member group is ‘collective voice of Islamic world’

The statement recognised the 57-member OIC as “one of the regional and sub-regional organisations that are appropriate for cooperation with the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security”.
It emphasised the importance of “establishing institutionalised cooperation” between the UN and such organisations, especially in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding efforts.
The statement also encouraged increased collaboration between the UN and the OIC through joint meetings, consultations, and joint activities.
In his address, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called the OIC “the collective voice of the Islamic world”.
He said the group has played a central role in addressing conflicts in member states, like Palestine, Jammu and Kashmir, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan welcomes the Council’s decision to strengthen the UN-OIC partnership and stands ready to support this effort,” Mr Dar said.
Referring to the conflict in Gaza, the foreign minister said: “We strongly believe that an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and the provision of humanitarian aid must be ensured.”
He said a two-state solution, with the “pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine” was the “only viable path to sustainable peace”.
Mr Dar said the OIC not only condemned Israeli aggression in Gaza but also mobilised global opinion in support of the Palestinian people.
Mr Dar reiterated Pakistan’s position that Kashmiris must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination as guaranteed by the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

• Judge says Shah Mehmood proved his presence in Karachi, Islamabad on day of arson
LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) judge, who sentenced PTI leaders in the case of violence at Sherpao Bridge on May 9, has said the convicts conspired to commit arson and were present at the site of violence.
PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted on 10 charges of terrorism, criminal conspiracy, rioting and injuring police personnel and damaging properties.
The verdict was announced by ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed on Tuesday.
The judge also convicted four local PTI leaders, Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Khalid Qayum Pahat, Ali Hassan Abbas, and Riaz Hussain.
The convicts have been awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment each under section 7(i)(h) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 and section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code, besides minor jail terms on eight charges.
They have also been awarded five-year imprisonment each under section 505 of the PPC for making statements conducing to public mischief. All sentences will run concurrently.
In the detailed order released on Thursday, the judge stated the four convicted senior leaders of PTI were exonerated of the charges of waging or conspiring to wage war against the country.
The judge observed most of the convicts, including Dr Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and Mr Rashid, didn’t dispute their presence at the site where the violence took place but claimed not to have committed any violence.
However, the prosecution produced video recordings in which the convicts were visible at the site of violence along with a mob. The defence did not challenge this evidence, the verdict added.
The judge said the record indicated the mob, armed with sticks, stones and petrol bombs, committed several acts of violence and rioting.
On the convicts’ role in violence, the judge noted once the hatching of a criminal conspiracy was established, it was not necessary for every person part of the mob to have committed violence.
On the charge of criminal conspiracy, the judge relied on the prosecution’s evidence, wherein two witnesses, who were police officials, claimed to have secretly attended PTI meetings.
In these meetings, the witnesses said, PTI Imran Khan instructed other leaders to attack military installations in case of his arrest from the Islamabad High Court.
These meetings were held at Mr Khan’s Zaman Park residence on May 7, 8 and 9, 2023.
The judge said both witnesses sufficiently described the conspiracy meetings in their statements and the defence failed to “create any plausible dent or doubt” in respect to the charge of conspiracy.
The judge maintained the conspiracy was further corroborated by a chain of events that took place soon after the arrest of Mr Khan.
“It is now an open secret that fateful incidents of 9th May 2023 took place all over the country and the modus operandi of the miscreants was to target military installations and law enforcement agencies,” the judge noted.
Qureshi’s acquittal
On the acquittal of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and five other suspects in the case, the judge observed Mr Qureshi successfully proved his presence in Karachi and Islamabad on the day of violence.
Moreover, Mr Qureshi had attended only one meeting on May 7 and was not involved in any violence that took place as per the instructions given in the meetings. Tuesday’s verdict was the first decision in any of the cases related to May 9 riots in Lahore.

The raid by criminals armed with automatic weapons, which followed a string of over 30 attacks on police in the area in the first half of 2025 by the banned TTP, is a grim reminder of the ever-deepening security vacuum in the area amid a jurisdictional dispute between law-enforcement agencies. The raid is evidence of the growing nexus between militant outfits operating in the area and local criminal gangs, often backed by powerful local tribal elders and politicians.
Spiralling lawlessness underlined by numerous gang assaults on industrial establishments — as well as the kidnapping and killing of factory staff — in recent years speaks volumes for the operational freedom these gangs and militant outfits enjoy in the area.
More disturbing is the fact that some gang members believed to have been involved in earlier attacks, including arson and attempted kidnappings, remain at large, despite their nomination in FIRs. Indeed, the difficult mountainous terrain of Koh-i-Sulaiman and tribal leaders’ apparent support for the criminals make it quite challenging for LEAs to take action against them.
The jurisdictional confusion between Punjab Police and the Border Military Police adds another layer of complexity, hampering coordinated efforts to act as a unified force against the criminals. The reluctance of police to take action against the area’s politically influential tribal leaders has worsened the situation further. Yet, the authorities can hardly afford to ignore the deterioration in security in the region. It goes without saying that the current lawlessness is frightening away potential industrial investments at the expense of development in the area and thwarting efforts to generate jobs for the local population.
The situation demands that the government act proactively and decisively by ensuring very close coordination between the LEAs, and build a reliable intelligence-gathering network to conduct targeted operations. The region risks becoming another flashpoint unless the network of militants and gangs is completely dismantled. The latest attack shows that time is running out fast; the cost of further delay in moving decisively will be too high for the people of the region.

• Scholars say family planning ‘permissible in Sharia’ for medical reasons
ISLAMABAD: The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) is split over endorsement for birth spacing to ensure maternal and child health, sources told Dawn on Thursday.
The CII, which advises parliament on how to align legislation with the principles of the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), held a one-day consultative session in collaboration with the Population Council on Thursday.
In the declaration issued after the session, CII members declared appropriate birth spacing essential for the health of mothers and children.
These methods also “align with Islamic teachings and social responsibility”.
Sources in the Council told Dawn the CII members were divided on the issue.
One group of traditional clerics opposed the term family planning and expressed concerns over concepts like birth spacing.
However, another group oppo­sed their peers and expressed serious concerns over the rising population and called for the active promotion of birth control methods.
The commission decided that Islam’s principle of ‘Mizan’ (balance) supported a responsible approach to parenting.
The session titled ‘The Concept of Mizan and Ihsan (excellence) in Islam: Balancing Resources and Population — Our Survival, Our Future’ was presided over by CII Chairman Allama Dr Raghib Hussain Naeemi.
The meeting explored Islamic and constitutional perspectives on family protection, maternal and child health, and rising population.
The scholars unanimously agreed that in cases of legitimate medical or social need — such as risk to the mother’s life, severe weakness, multiple surgeries, or breastfeeding needs — temporary family planning is permissible in Shariah.
In his opening remarks, Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, senior director of programmes and research at the Population Council, said the rising birth rate was linked to serious challenges, particularly in maternal and child health, including complications and diseases that could impact future generations.
He highlighted the national narrative titled “Tawazun” (balance), which the government developed in consultation with religious leaders to promote responsible family planning.
The declaration issued after the meeting noted that Islam placed great importance on protecting life and lineage, two of the core objectives of Shariah.
“Ensuring maternal and child health and family wellbeing is, therefore, a religious duty,” the declaration said.
While the declaration added birth control methods should be used “within Islamic bounds” and not involve “harmful or impermissible practices”, it did not elaborate on permissible methods.
The scholars noted the Holy Quran encouraged mothers to breastfeed for two years, which naturally leads to spacing between births. This ensures that children receive proper health, nutrition, and education.
The session decided that the Constitution also obliged the state to ensure public welfare, quality health and education, and family security.
“Therefore, balancing population and resources, securing a healthy future generation, and promoting women’s participation are national responsibilities”, the declaration said
The scholars also pledged to spread awareness among the public, clarify misconceptions and guide society toward family wellbeing.
Talking to Dawn, CII member Allama Tahir Ashrafi said that issues like birth spacing and traditional misconceptions associated with them cannot be handled alone by clerics only. “The state too has to play an active role.”

Officials said Bibi Gul Jan was detained by the Serious Crimes Investi­gation Wing (SCIW) and produced before the Anti-Terro­rism Court (ATC) the same day. Investigators requested her rem­and, which the court approved for two days, handing her over to SCIW officials.
So far, police have arrested 16 people in connection with the Dagari killings, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai and Basher Ahmed, both of whom were remanded to SCIW custody for 10 days earlier this week.
Sardar Sherbaz was the chief of the Satakzai tribe, from which the victim Bano Bibi also belonged and was killed along with a man identified as Ehsanullah Samalani in the name of so-called honour.
However, the main suspect, Jalal Satakzai, remains at large.
He was seen in a viral video firing shots at his sister, Bano  “We are making all efforts to arrest the main accused,” a senior police officer said.
In a video statement that surfaced on Wednesday night, Gul Jan claimed that Sardar Sherbaz was not involved in the decision to kill Bano and Ehsanullah.
“The decision to kill Bano and Ehsan was taken by her family according to Baloch traditions and customs, and Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai had no role in it,” the woman said.
She also revealed Bano was the mother of three sons and two daughters.
The killings sparked outrage after footage of the double murder went viral, highlighting that “honour killings” continue to persist in Balochistan despite strict laws criminalising such acts.
Human rights groups have long criticised the slow enforcement of these laws, particularly in tribal areas where jirgas and traditional councils continue to wield influence.

People gather along a precipice as locals work to clear the water channel of a powerhouse damaged by floods in the Tangir area of Gilgit-Baltistan.—Dawn

GILGIT: Dozens of houses were damaged after heavy rainfall and ‘cloudburst’ triggered flash floods in multiple villages of Gilgit-Baltistan, severing road links and destroying agricultural land.
Flash floods caused damage in Tangir, the hometown of the Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister, Ghanche, and Gilgit’s Sikarkoi and Kundas villages.
Police said flash floods damaged public and private properties, including administrative offices, markets, power infrastructure, and communication systems in Tangir Valley. The water entered the local police station, destroying official records and equipment, and the residences of the police officers were also damaged.
Likewise, the offices of the assistant commissioner and additional deputy commissioner sustained heavy damage, while a residential house near the AC office completely collapsed in the flash flood.

Spokesperson says six people killed so far; Babusar Road remains blocked

In Ghanche district, more than 60 houses in various areas were damaged by the flash floods, which also washed away a bridge. The rise in water level in the Shyok River intensified erosion along the riverbank, whereas roads in the area remained blocked.
 
 

In the Chogo Grong area of Kondus in Ghanche, water damaged mosques, a school, a dispensary, roads, agricultural land, and livestock. Flash floods in the Sikarkoi and Kundas areas in Gilgit damaged several houses, shops, roads, and other infrastructure in multiple locations.
The flash flood also damaged motorcycles and cars parked outside houses. The floodwater affe­cted several shops at Tangir Bazar and damaged the water channel of the Shekho powerhouse, which led to electricity outages.
 
 

According to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, over one hundred homes collapsed in Gilgit-Baltistan over the past few days, and six people have also died in flash floods this week. He said search and rescue operations were underway in Babusar Valley for missing tourists.
He said more than 300 stranded tourists had been rescued from Babusar and shifted to Gilgit, Ska­rdu, and Chilas.
The Babusar Road remained closed to traffic on Thu­rsday; but the Karakoram High­way remained open for light traffic.

• Says fresh operations not acceptable; wants military to stop using ‘quadcopters’ to avoid harming civilians
• MPC says grand jirga planned next month to devise implementation plan; ANP, PML-N, JUI-F boycott moot
• Naqvi says all options to end militancy will remain on the table, takes dig at CM for paying ‘protection money’ to militants
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur railed against the policy of harbouring ‘Good Taliban’ — a euph­emism used to describe militants who have laid down arms — following a multi-party moot organised by the KP government to find a solution for the militancy plaguing the province.
The conference came amid a significant rise in terrorism across the province, particularly in districts bordering Afghanistan, which has prompted calls for a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region.
The KP chief minister opposed these calls, saying that while operations were conducted in the past, they failed to achieve the desired objective despite widespread destruction. While sharing details of the declaration following the moot, CM Gandapur said several operations were carried out against the ‘Good Taliban’ apparently by the police, but the militants were being supported allegedly by the ‘institutions’.
The CM claimed these ‘Good Taliban’ were arrested and areas were cleared by the police, but they were allegedly released by the intelligence agencies.
“Now they (Good Taliban) have come again. Please, these ‘Good Tali­ban’ are not acceptable and if you really want to keep them, give them uniform, and send them to [India-occupied] Kashmir,” he said, adding that the government would take action against anyone carrying arms.
“Anyone who is keeping these Good Taliban should expel and eliminate them,” the CM demanded.
The chief minister said that several offensives were carried out against militants in the province but all of them ended up in the loss of lives, leaving behind many martyred, but still failed to achieve the desired objectives. He said that border management was the responsibility of the federal government but it never fulfilled this responsibility since militant infiltration from Afghanistan continued.
“Deploy the military on the border. We have the capacity to manage things inside the province,” the chief minister said, adding that he would be responsible if the police failed to fulfil its responsibilities in the province. According to the CM, they want clearly defined roles so that whoever failed in their job could be held accountable. The participants of the meeting were of the view that the police were trained enough to maintain law and order in the province.
 


“They [the military] are not doing their core job and instead are roaming in an area, which falls within my jurisdiction,” he claimed, adding that military operations caused damages without any positive results. No other operation would be allowed, he reiterated.
Quadcopter attacks
Reading further from the declaration, the CM said the “drone attacks” being carried out by both sides – the security forces and the terrorists – were causing civilian deaths. The MPC declared quadcopters would not be used anymore for action against militants, he added.
 
 

The MPC also discussed the federal government’s refusal to fulfil its commitments made with people from the merged districts. He also said that mines and minerals were the province’s property and would remain with the province. He said the provincial government would never allow taxing Malakand Division and asked the federal government to withdraw this move.
He further said the MPC approved convening a jirga, comprising elders, parliamentarians, and stakeholders from every district, adding that after 15 days, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised to devise a strategy for the implementation of this declaration.
The MPC was attended by Jamaat-i-Islami, Qaumi Watan Party, JUI-Sami, the PML-N (only one member attended), and the PTI-Parliamentarian. The PML-N, JUI-F, PPP, and the ANP, however, boycotted the conference.
In response, particularly over the opposition to the use of quadcopters announced by the KP CM, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi responded on X that all resources would be used for the elimination of terrorism. He also took another potshot at the CM, asking how much money “an important KP government leader in D.I. Khan pays to the Taliban”.
 






Separately, PPP senators Palwasha Khan and Senator Quratulain Marri criticised the KP CM for not inviting other political parties to the MPC, saying those who had rendered sacrifices were being criticised.

• Dar to meet Rubio today for wide-ranging talks; expected to discuss India-Pakistan dynamics
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said the Afghan Taliban were showing “receptivity” to Pakistan’s concerns over sanctuaries of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) in Afghanistan, signaling cautious optimism about progress on one of the most sensitive issues straining bilateral ties between the two countries.
“One of the stumbling blocks is the sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorists there. There is an active engagement going on between the two sides, and Afghan side is showing receptivity to our concerns communicated to them in this regard,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters at a weekly briefing.
 
 

The presence of TTP militants in Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between Islamabad and the Taliban administration. Since the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has accused the group of sheltering thousands of TTP fighters, who have escalated attacks on Pakistani security forces, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan provinces.
The violence intensified after a fragile ceasefire between Pakistan and the TTP collapsed in November 2022. Pakistani officials estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 TTP fighters operate from within Afghanistan, emboldened by what Islamabad sees as ideological affinity and inaction from the Afghan Taliban. Kabul has consistently denied providing safe havens.
Tensions between the two countries have remained high in rec­ent years, with Pakistan warning that continued cross-border militancy could derail ties. However, relations began to improve following Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Kabul on April 19, during which both sides discussed trade, border management and security cooperation. That visit led to what officials described as a “tactical thaw” encouraged by Beijing.
The resumption of high-level engagements, including the upgrade of diplomatic representation from chargé d’affaires to ambassador level, has signaled a renewed willingness to address long-standing grievances.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s visit to Kabul on Sunday, accompanied by Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Ambassador Muhammad Sadiq, further built on that momentum.
Mr Naqvi held talks with Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, focusing on cross-border security, the threat posed by the TTP, and efforts to curb drug trafficking and manage refugee repatriation.
According to Pakistani officials, the Taliban administration agreed in principle to a “phased process” to disarm and relocate TTP fighters away from the border - a step seen as a rare acknowledgment of the issue.
“The technical discussions are ongoing. The two sides are positively engaged, and cooperation in security area has to be seen in the broader ambit of overall positivity and improvement of relations between the two brotherly neighboring countries,” Mr Khan said.
“There have been issues, or multiple issues, ranging from logistics, customs, procedure etc. impacting trade. So all of these are being addressed, and you can see the momentum it is generating. So, there is good progress on the trade,” Mr Khan said.
Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is expected to visit Islamabad in the coming weeks for follow-up discussions.
Dar-Rubio meeting
The FO spokesman also said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is scheduled to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington today (Friday) for wide-ranging talks.
“I can confirm that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and the entire range of issues on the bilateral agenda, as well as important regional and global issues including the situation in the Middle East, and Iran will be discussed,” Mr Khan said.
“Exchange of views will also take place on the Pakistan-India question, for which we remain grateful for the role played by the US in de-escalation of tensions leading to ceasefire,” he added.
Mr Dar is on an official visit to US for participating in events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council Presidency in New York, as well as for bilateral engagements with US in Washington.
The Pakistan-India dispute returned to global focus after a brief but intense military clash in May, triggered by an April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-occupied Kashmir, that killed 26 people.
India blamed Pakistan-based militants and launched strikes on May 7 against alleged terrorist camps in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. Pakistan responded with Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, targeting Indian military sites in the fiercest exchange since 1971.
Fearing escalation, the US intervened diplomatically, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance mediating between both sides. A ceasefire was announced on May 10, which Islamabad credits to US efforts.
“Our position is that the issues have to be resolved through diplomacy and peaceful means, and we remain committed to it,” Mr Khan said.
“We engage with all countries in good faith, and we continue to invite India to come to the negotiating table and move towards a peaceful settlement of disputes. But the key question is for India to decide what kind of policy it wants to adopt.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, our position is very clear,” he added. “We have acknowledged and thanked the US intervention and the role it played in the de-escalation of the recent crisis. But again, it is for India to decide the route it wants to take, the policy it wants to adopt,” the FO spokesman said.

After KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur led a multi-party conference, attended by the leaders of Jamat-i-Islami, Qaumi Watan Party, JUI-S, PML-N and PTI-Parliamentarian, a delegation of tribal leaders also met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The meeting between the PM and tribal elders was also attended by JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman and KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
 
 

“The meeting was aimed at countering the surge of terrorism with the help of tribal elders,” a participant of the meeting told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.

In meeting with jirga, premier restores admission quota of students from ex-Fata

The prime minister announced a number of incentives for the merged tribal areas, but the meeting categorically ruled out the reversal of the former Fata’s merger with KP.
During the meeting, Federal Minister for Safron and Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam reiterated the federal government had no intention to roll back the merger or alter the existing constitutional arrangement.
 
 

It is important to note the tribal elders have expressed grievances over the mer­ger and Mr Rehman, the JUI-F leader, had called the move “a big mistake”.
Mr Muqam, who heads the committee to revive the jirga system in tribal areas, said the body will make recommendations within the existing constitutional framework on matters concerning justice, development and security.
“There is no plan to withdraw [the merger] or amend the Constitution”, Mr Muqam told the jirga members who had voiced concerns over the committee’s mandate.
The PM also assured the tribal elders the committee’s TORs will be enhanced and they will be given representation in it.
“The committee will now include representation from tribal elders to ensure inclusive decision-making,” said a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
Admission quota
The PM also announced the admission quota for students from tribal areas in the federal government’s universities will be restored.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that tribespeople have rendered “immense sacrifices for the peace and security of Pakistan”.
He reaffirmed that ensuring law and order in the merged areas was among the government’s top priorities.
The PM paid tribute to the armed forces, police and other law enforcement personnel for their bravery in fighting terrorism, and urged unity among all communities.
Highlighting the government’s commitment to the socio-economic uplift of the region, the PM said his government was investing heavily in education, healthcare, skills training, and employment opportunities for the youth of the merged districts.
He said substantial funds have been allocated for improving infrastructure, including the Fata University and police.
The PM directed an expansion in the scope of the federal committee working on the issues of merged districts, chaired by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam.
The tribal delegation appreciated the restoration of educational quotas, inclusion in the federal committee, and overall developmental initiatives.
The premier assured the participants that such consultative sessions would be held regularly to ensure that the voices of the tribal people are heard and their issues addressed effectively.
Meeting with Gilani
Earlier, the 90-member tribal jirga, led by Governor Kundi, met Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani.
The Jirga included prominent tribal elders, including Dr Alamzeb Mohmand, Malik Khan Marjan Wazir, and Bismillah Khan Afridi.
Mr Gilani said cooperation from tribal elders was vital to achieve lasting peace.
He announced the issues of the merged districts will be discussed in the Senate to formulate a clear and comprehensive national policy.
Governor Kundi highlighted the merged districts were assured a three per cent share in the NFC Award under the Accelerated Implementation Programme.
However, the commitment has not been fully implemented and the federal government has often allocated amounts lower than originally pledged.

NEWLY elected PTI senators Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Noor ul Haq Qadri and Faisal Javed take oath.—White Star

• Resolution rejects justification for such crimes on cultural grounds
• House passes Whistleblower Protection Commission Bill, okays 20pc reward for exposing corruption
• Navy Ordinance amended with stricter penalties for misconduct
• Eight new senators sworn in
ISLAMABAD: Alarmed by a brutal act of vigilante justice in Balochistan, where a man and woman were executed in broad daylight under a jirga verdict in the name of “honour”, the Senate on Thursday called for an immediate and transparent investigation to bring all perpetrators — inclu­ding those who convened or sanctioned the jirga — to justice.
In a resolution adopted almost unanimously, the Senate declared that so-called honour killings were not “honourable”, rather constituted murder under the law and must be prosecuted as such.
The resolution, tabled by PPP parliamentary leader Senator Sherry Rehman, was supported by all parties across the aisle except JUI-F, which refused to sign.
 
 

Lawmakers stressed that the rule of law could not be selectively applied and that tribal or informal justice systems must not override constitutional protections and due process.
The resolution rejected any justification of such crimes on cultural, tribal or traditional grounds and condemned attempts to legitimise them under the guise of “ghairat” (honour), describing them as victim-blaming.
The resolution recalled previous legislative reforms aimed at curbing honour crimes, particularly by disallowing compoundability or conciliation in such cases. However, it expressed concern that despite these legal safeguards, implementation remains weak and justice is often subverted, especially in high-profile cases targeting women.
The House stressed that law enforcement agencies must treat such cases strictly under the relevant provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, without compromise or discretion.
It also urged the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Mini­stry of Human Rights to conduct a thorough review of the enforcement gaps in existing laws dealing with the so-called honour crimes and reco­­mm­end actionable reforms.
 
 

“This premeditated act of vigilante murders constitutes an abhorrent crime; it is a gross violation of human rights, the Constitution and the laws of Pakistan,” it said.
Whistleblower commission
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was the passage of a bill to establish an independent Whistleblower Protection and Vigilance Commission, aiming to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, promising a reward for those exposing corruption in public institutions.
As per the bill, the Commission will have civil court powers to assess complaints and conduct judicial proceedings. Whistle­blowers will be entitled to 20 per cent of any recovered amount and a certificate of appreciation.
However, submitting false or frivolous information will carry a penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs200,000, which will be paid to the falsely accused. Those facing retaliation can seek redressal from the Commission, whose orders will be binding.
The whistleblower’s identity will remain confidential unless disclosed with written consent. Violators will face fines of up to Rs500,000 and imprisonment of up to two years.
Law ministry officials noted that the existing 2017 law lacked effective enforcement mechanisms. The new Commission, headquartered in Islamabad, will operate autonomously and may set up offices across Pakistan if needed. It will consist of at least three members, including a chairperson, with the government authorised to expand membership when required.
Navy Ordinance amendments
The Senate also passed the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, allowing the Navy to engage in activities linked to national development or strategic interests with federal or provincial consent.
The relevant naval authority may retire or discharge any individual and has the right to accept or reject resignations. In times of war, individuals over 60 years of age may be retained in service upon the recommendation of the naval chief.
According to the bill, officers who fail to defend ships and other assets may face the death penalty or long-term imprisonment. Refusal to fight in the event of an attack, cowardice or abandoning a ship in danger may also lead to similar punishments.
Naval personnel involved in extortion or corruption will face lengthy jail terms, as will those who accept bribes, agree to bribery or cause harm or favouritism.
Disclosing official information could lead to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment, and if the information harms national security or the armed forces, the individual will be tried under the Official Secrets Act.
One of the amendments reads, “A person who is or has been subject to this Ordinance commits an offence under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Act XL of 2016) or relevant electronic, digital, social media laws, with the mala fide intention to undermine, ridicule, or scandalise, the armed forces of Pakistan, may be proceeded under this Ordinance and on conviction by a court constituted under this Ordinance, shall be punished in the prescribed manner with the same punishments as provided for in the said Act XL of 2016 or such other laws, as the case may be.”
Meanwhile, Minister for Power Awais Leghari dismissed reports that Nepra had approved a multi-year tariff for K-Electric to recover its losses from consumers. Responding to a calling-attention notice by Senator Faisal Sabzwari, he explained that the reports related to the 2023-24 financial year, when the current government was not in power.
Sworn in
In a separate development, eight of the 11 recently elected senators from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took the oath of office on Thursday, hours after the ECP issued their victory notifications. Those who were sworn in on Thursday included Noorul Haq Qadri, Faisal Javed Khan, Rubina Khalid, Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed, Dilawar Khan, Attaul Haq and Mirza Muhammad Afridi.

ISLAMABAD: Almost a week after finalising its formal structure, a six-party opposition alliance — including the PTI —said it will organise a multi-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and Aug 1 to discuss the “deepening constitutional and political crises” and restore “true democratic representation”.
In a press conference held in the federal capital on Thursday, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, flanked by other alliance leaders, said it was time for a “serious” national dialogue to steer the country out of the troubled waters.
Mr Achakzai emphasised the conference would not be “symbolic”, saying it would bring together political parties, civil society and even “representatives from institutions” to find a lasting and durable solution to the problems facing the country. “From Gilgit-Baltistan to Gwadar, we will mobilise, street by street, door to door — but without violence and abuse because this struggle is principled and constitutional,” he added.
He said the opposition alliance was not formed for “political theatrics” but to restore true democratic representation through a neutral election commission, adding that it was the ‘first alliance’ not manufactured by the intelligence agencies.
Mr Achakzai criticised the ruling coalition for using force to suppress political opponents.
He demanded a neutral election watchdog to ensure fair representation, saying Pakistan must be governed by the ballot, not force. According to Mr Achakzai, the Shehbaz-led government has imposed control through force, which is undemocratic and unacceptable.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI Secre­tary General Salman Akram Raja said that as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s instructions, it was not just PTI’s movement but a movement representing every oppressed voice in Pakistan. “Today, we speak for all those denied justice and silenced by fear,” he said, adding that the TTAP was a “peaceful, constitutional and ideological” movement.
He asserted that Pakistan could not be run by force, as the only way forward was constitutionalism, democracy, and justice. “We urge the people to peacefully express their discontent on August 5, within constitutional bounds. This is a lawful call — no one should exploit it to justify state repression,” he said while referring to the PTI’s planned protest on Aug 5 marking the second anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment.
 
 

Mr Raja claimed that Imran Khan was being subjected to a jail trial without access to his legal team. “I, as his lawyer, was deliberately prevented from participating in the proceedings which was a gross violation of due process and judicial transparency,” he maintained.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Nasir Abbas said if democracy truly existed in Pakistan, the controversial decision regarding the reserved seats would not have been made.
He said he was disappointed that no other political party had condemned these decisions, as he accused the ‘system’ of playing a vile game with the public.
The MWM chief stressed that although the alliance did not believe in armed struggle, it would not remain silent in the face of injustice.
He announced plans for a countrywide protest on August 5, warning the government against any attempts to obstruct their demonstration.
Furthermore, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram denounced the government’s approach ahead of the party’s planned protest movement on August 5.
He condemned the issuance of warrants for the arrest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, former president Dr Arif Alvi and other key opposition figures, including Omar Ayub Khan, Asad Qaiser, Hammad Azhar, and Khalid Khurshid.
He also denounced the sentencing of the PTI protesters for their involvement in the November 26 demonstration, calling these actions a blatant attempt to suppress dissent and undermine peaceful political mobilisation.
Speaking on the occasion, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that the first step of the movement was a multi-party conference, and all those who feel oppressed under the current government would be invited to participate in the moot.
On the occasion, PTI senior leader Babar Awan claimed that Imran Khan was a prisoner of conscience, who was allegedly being held in a solitary cell, denied basic human rights, medical care, and even clean water, which was a clear violation of international law and the Nelson Mandela prison rules.
“The PTI founder is not only Pakistan’s most popular leader, but he is the hope of the people. Yet he is being treated worse than a prisoner of war. Even his lawyers and family were barred from meeting him on Thursday,” he lamented.
“This is not justice — this is humiliation of democracy. If justice is denied, protest remains the only path,” Mr Awan added.

A leading global real estate services firm, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), acting as financial adviser for the hotel’s privatisation, has cited a “potential conflict of interest” for its decision.
 
 

JLL, which had recommended the joint venture model for the Roosevelt, a 1,015-room historic hotel in Midtown Manhattan, has conveyed its decision to the Privatisation Commission.
Announcing the resignation, the Privatisation Commission said on Thursday it was initiating the process to hire a new financial adviser on a fast-track basis to ensure that the privatisation of Roosevelt Hotel proceeds “in a transparent and competitive manner”.
JLL has cited “hei­ghtened interest” in the hotel from many of its own clients and cancellation of its lease agreement with New York City as reasons for the decision to withdr­­aw from the assignment.
 
 

JLL said these issues had put the company in a “compromising position” and it was resigning “to avoid any perceived or act­ual conflict of interest”.
JLL was appointed as financial adviser in Janu­ary 2024 to advise the government on the privatisation of the hotel.
The company has alrea­­dy conducted due dilige­n­­ce on the property and sub­­mitted transaction str­ucture reports, analysing a range of options in line with international best practices.
Business at the hotel was suspended in 2020 following financial losses incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic.

• UK PM terms situation ‘unspeakable & indefensible’ humanitarian catastrophe
• UN says it can’t verify aid delivery due to lack of access as mass starvation haunts Palestinians
JERUSALEM: Israel and the United States recalled their delegations from Gaza ceasefire talks for consultations on Thur­s­­day, as Hamas blamed Tel Aviv’s “stalling” for the delay in securing peace in the besieged enclave.
A senior Hamas source told Reuters that there was still a chance of reaching a Gaza cea­sefire agreement, but it would take a few days because of what he called Israeli stalling.
The source said Hamas’ response to the latest ceasefire proposal included requesting a clause that would prevent Israel from resuming the war if an agreement was not reached within the 60-day truce period.
A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters the latest Hamas position was “flexible, positive and took into consideration the growing suffering in Gaza and the need to stop the starvation”.
But even as Israel said it was reviewing a revised response from Hamas to a proposed cea­­sefire and prisoner-release deal, US and Israeli delegations withdrew from the talks, accusing Hamas of failing to act in good faith.
“While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith. We will now consider alternative options to bring the [prisoners] home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said in a statement on X.
According to Reuters, the latest draft proposed by Hamas calls for a return to protocol agreed on Jan 19 to allow aid entry to Gaza, seeks return to old mechanism of its distribution, and includes modified maps for Israeli military deployment in the strip.
European ‘emergency call’
UK PM Keir Starmer has offered an uncharacteristically sympathetic account of the situation in Gaza, terming the starvation unfolding in the besieged enclave a “unspeakable and indefensible” humanitarian catastrophe, while calling on Israel to urgently allow in aid.
While the situation has been grave for some time, it has rea­ched new depths and continues to worsen, he said in a statement.
“I will hold an emergency call with E3 partners tomorrow, where we will discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need while pulling toge­ther all the steps necessary to build a lasting peace.”
 
 

UN unable to verify aid
Meanwhile, two different arms of the United Nations expressed frustration over Israel’s continued denial of access for aid to Gaza.
The UNRWA has “the equivalent of 6,000 loaded trucks of food and medical supplies” waiting in Jordan and Egypt, its commissioner Philippe Laz­za­ri­­ni said on Thursday.
Meanwhile, UN-OCHA spok­esp­er­son Jens Laerke maintai­ned that des­pite repeated req­uests, Israel has not allowed its staff to be present at the crossings.
Laerke explained that the UN needed multiple approvals from the Israeli authorities: firstly to get aid across the border from Israel into the Gaza Strip, where it is dropped off — the trucks returning to Israel — followed by another approval to drive trucks from inside Gaza to collect it.
“We therefore cannot verify the amount of supplies curren­tly at the crossing,” he told AFP.
According to the health ministry in Gaza, of the 113 people who died from malnutrition since October 2023, 81 were children and 32 were adults, BBC News reported.
Aid groups say there is no shortage in the supply of food, but Israel is obstructing it and making it virtually impossible for humanitarian assistance to reach millions of people who desperately need it.

• Committee agrees seeking amendments in Finance Bill so soon after its passage would be imprudent
ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday reported more than Rs2.2 trillion worth of tax evasion through ‘fake’ and ‘flying’ invoices over the past two fiscal years, highlighting the massive scale of loss of public monies due to weak enforcement.
Testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Federal Board Of Revenue (FBR) Member Hamid Atique Sarwar said that more than Rs873bn in ‘fake’ and ‘flying’ invoices had been unearthed last year, on top of Rs1.37 trillion a year earlier, taking the total to Rs2.25tr in two years.
“This is almost one-third of the total” tax collected on the customs side, he said in response to calls from the business community for a relaxation in tax laws under the Finance Bill 2025-26.
 
 

Mr Sarwar said such massive loss of revenue could not be allowed to continue, adding that taxmen misusing their powers had been proceeded against.
He said no other department at the federal or provincial level had taken punitive action against its own workforce like FBR had.
He said the law in place since 1996 envisaged arrest if an assistant commissioner had reasons to believe that tax evasion was taking place, record was being tampered or suspects were fleeing abroad. But the latest Finance Bill provided multiple safeguards to avoid harassment of businessmen and taxpayers.
The committee held an extensive discussion on several anomalies in the Budget 2025–26, including briefings from members of the chambers of commerce, with a specific focus on clauses granting powers of arrest to the FBR on the basis of mere suspicion.
State Minister for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kiyani said the prime minister had constituted a committee to redress the grievances of the chambers.
Moreover, a review and redressal committee had also been constituted for a periodic review of the business community’s issues.
Mr Kiyani said a circular would be issued soon to clarify the lacunae highlighted by the chambers, following detailed discussions with business community.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, and the other members agreed with the state minister that it would not be good optics to seek amendments to the finance bill just a month after its passage, with the consent of the International Monetary Fund .
Another FBR member, Dr Najeeb, said the government had diluted the taxpayers powers following pushback from coalition partners, parliamentarians and others and there had been a lot of difference between the finance bill originally introduced in the parliament and later passed by the parliament.
He said conceded that the extensive deliberations over the finance bill with the standing committees of the National Assembly and the Senate did not leave them enough time for the usual anomaly committees to address all concerns, leaving some room for misunderstandings.
However, he maintained that the “element of fear” was being unnecessarily overblown.
While discussing software exports over the last 15 years, the committee recommended the State Bank of Pakistan to submit data with the clear categorisation of freelancers share in software exports.
The committee also recommended the removal of periodical and journal subscriptions from the IT services list.

Chairing a meeting on civil service reforms, the PM directed the committee to submit comprehensive, reform-oriented proposals within one month after detailed consultations.
He directed the committee to develop recommendations regarding the merit-based recruitment of top talent, the development of key performance indicator or KPI-based performance targets for promotions, and the improvement of the Annual Confidential Report system, as well as suggestions for effective alternatives.
 
 

The recommendations should also include a plan to enhance officers’ capacity through modern technology and systems, he said, stressing that the recommendations must aim to lay the foundation for a sustainable system, ensure improved governance and establish a continuous mechanism to align the civil services with contemporary demands.

Meets World Bank VP, reaffirms commitment to strengthening development cooperation

During the briefing on civil service reforms, it was stated that suggestions were being developed following consultation on recruitment, training, performance evaluation, salary impro­vement and promotions in the civil service.
A comparative analysis of civil service reforms in other countries in the region, including Pakistan, was also presented.
The meeting was informed that the final recommendations will focus on improving governance, enhancing the quality of life for ordinary citizens, and ensuring a merit-based recruitment of top talent at the core of civil service reforms.
Meeting with World Bank VP
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz met with Ousmane Dione, the regional vice president of the World Bank for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to reaffirm mutual commitment to strengthening development cooperation.
The prime minister thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their key role in advancing the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Pakistan.
He appreciated the CPF’s strategic role in supporting Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change and governance reforms.
He also acknowledged the World Bank’s principled support for Pakistan’s legitimate position, in light of India’s unilateral and unlawful actions that undermine important international agreements, such as the Indus Waters Treaty.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to upholding international law, regional peace and resolving disputes through dialogue. He also thanked the World Bank for its timely support following the devastating 2022 floods, which helped the government initiate relief and reconstruction efforts.
Mr Dione reaffirmed the World Bank’s commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan.

A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival. Police announced the arrest of 11 individuals a day ago, including the administrator of the unregistered seminary, in connection with the brutal killing.
The police presented the 11 suspects before the Khwazakhela judicial magistrate today — the administrator of the madressah and another key individual.
Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Omar Khan told Dawn.com that the police had formed special teams and a search operation was underway to apprehend the remaining two suspects.
“We have some key leads to locate the main suspects and will reach them soon,” he said.
Meanwhile, the provincial head of Wifaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Hussain Ahmad, strongly condemned the brutal beating and killing of the student. He called the incident “a deeply tragic and painful event” for the entire community.
“It is unfortunate that in the aftermath of this incident, a targeted propaganda campaign has been launched against Islamic seminaries, ignoring their decades of collective service to society,” Ahmad said at a press conference, where multiple other religious leaders and scholars expressed their condolences.
A day earlier, authorities said that the madressah where the incident occurred had been sealed, adding that police detained all madressah staff, with nine more taken into custody. A case was registered on the police’s complaint under the Child Protection Act.
Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.
In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was arrested for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.
Cleric arrested in Swabi for torturing minor at mosque
Separately, a cleric was arrested in the Swabi district for “torturing” a six-year-old child in a local mosque in Swabi’s Chota Lahor area, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Muhammad Noman said.
He said, “The cleric tortured the child for not remembering his lesson,” adding that a case was registered against the suspect under Section 44 of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.
According to a first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, the incident occurred a day ago at 6pm.
According to a press release issued by the DPO office, the father of the child informed the police that his son was acquiring religious education at the Jamia Masjid in Meera Dhok, Mohalla, near Chota Lahor.
The father said his son went to the mosque as per his normal routine, but red marks were clearly visible on his son’s back and he was in pain when he returned home, adding that his teacher had beaten the child with a stick for being late.
The statement said a police team immediately reached the spot and arrested the suspect, registering a case against him.
DSP Noman said that such incidents should be reported to the local police immediately and they were bound to take prompt and result-oriented steps.
“The children of this society are the children of all of us,” he said in a press conference.</p><small>2025-07-24 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2422001441fb898.jpg?r=220023' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926327/imran-decries-lack-of-meaningful-momentum-for-aug-5-protest-orders-pti-to-shun-all-differences' target='_blank'><strong>Imran decries lack of ‘meaningful momentum’ for Aug 5 protest, orders PTI to shun all differences</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned August 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.
However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to disrupt the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‘a final push’. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.
The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters.
In a post today on his X account — which is not operated by Imran himself — a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: “Let me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.”
The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.
“After such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.
“Anyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,” the message warned.
 






Lashing out at the government, the message said it had “crippled the judiciary” through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
 
 

“The way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.”
The message claimed “inhumane conditions” were being imposed upon Imran’s spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder’s conditions were themselves not good.
“I am enduring the harshest prison term in the country’s history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.”
Separately, a post from PTI’s central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
“All provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.”
 






Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.
Imran’s sons continue US engagements
Meanwhile, Imran’s sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.
They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the “persecution” of their father.
 






They also met US Congressman Brad Sherman.
“I am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating. The people of Pakistan deserve to have their leaders be treated fairly under the law,” he said in a post on X about the meeting.

Blasphemy is an incendiary charge in Pakistan, where even unsubstantiated accusations can incite public outrage and lead to lynchings.
Last week, the IHC gave the federal government 30 days to constitute a commission to investigate misuse of blasphemy law, giving the order during the hearing of a case seeking such a commission’s formation. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan ordered that the commission should complete its work within four months, while allowing the possibility for an extension.
Rao Abdur Rahim, a lawyer from the Legal Commission on Blasphemy Pakistan, and others had filed an intra-court appeal against Justice Khan’s verdict. The case was heard today by Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Azam Khan.
Advocate Kamran Murtaza and others appeared before the court on behalf of Rahim. Asked how they felt about the decision, Murtaza argued that they had not been given a full hearing.
“There are four hundred cases and some cases are beyond the jurisdiction of this court,” Murtaza said. “Can a commission be formed in this case?”
He added that the court was giving orders “as though it was above the Supreme Court”.
The bench subsequently suspended last week’s order and issued notices to the parties.
 
 

During last week’s hearing, Justice Ishaq expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman named Komal Ismail, the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing on Monday.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.
According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.
Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.
Retired colonel’s body found in Rawalpindi
Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who went missing after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.
Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.
District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”
Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.
“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement had said.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Last week, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.
Residents block GT Road protesting failure to recover teenager’s body
On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.
On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.
Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.
40 people trapped in Attock canal rescued
Separately, Rescue 1122 said its personnel safely evacuated 40 people trapped in a canal at Shinka in Punjab’s Attock district.

“According to details, 40 people were trapped in a canal due to high water level in the Indus River at Shinka in Hazro Tehsil,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
“All people were safely evacuated in a rescue operation that lasted for five hours,” it added, noting that teams reached the spot under DEO Ali Hussain’s supervision.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2412581446b8648.jpg?r=130024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926266/plane-crash-in-russias-far-east-kills-nearly-50-people' target='_blank'><strong>Plane crash in Russia’s far east kills nearly 50 people</strong></a><br><p>A passenger plane carrying nearly 50 people crashed in a remote area of Russia’s far eastern Amur region on Thursday, killing all on board, authorities said.
The plane, a Soviet-made twin-propeller Antonov-24, went down in remote, thickly forested terrain, leaving a column of smoke pouring from the crash site and no signs of survivors, according to state media and videos published by investigators.
The Angara Airlines flight was headed to the town of Tynda from the city of Blagoveshchensk when it disappeared from radar at around 1pm local time (0400 GMT).
A rescue helicopter later spotted the burning fuselage of the plane on a forested mountain slope about 15 kilometres south of Tynda’s airport.
 






Videos published by Russian investigators showed smoke rising from the crash site and what appeared to be fragments of the plane strewn across the forest floor.
A search and rescue team arrived only hours after the crash at the remote, hard-to-reach site and found no evidence of survivors, according to the state news agency TASS.
Investigators did not say what caused the crash.
Weather conditions at the time of the incident were poor, Angara Airlines CEO Sergei Salamanov told Russia’s REN TV channel.
“The commander made the decision to carry out the flight,” he was quoted as saying.
Tynda, home to around 30,000 people, lies in an area of thick taiga forest about 200km from the Chinese border.
At least one Chinese national was on the flight, state media in China reported.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
“I would like to express my deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the families of the victims,” Xi said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
The plane dropped from radar while attempting a second approach to land at Tynda, regional prosecutors said.
The forest terrain complicated search efforts, a rescuer told the TASS agency.
“The main search operations are being conducted from the air,” it said.
Angara Airlines, a small regional carrier based in the Russian city of Irkutsk, did not immediately release a statement on the crash.
Five children
Russia’s aviation watchdog has not yet given a definitive number of people on board.
The Amur region’s governor, Vasily Orlov, said the plane was carrying 43 passengers and six crew members.
Among the passengers were five children, he said.
The TASS agency cited emergency services as saying the plane was carrying 40 passengers and six crew.
Aviation authorities have opened an investigation.
The plane appeared to have been manufactured almost 50 years ago, during the Soviet era, according to civil aviation database Russianplanes.net.
In 2021, the aircraft’s airworthiness certificate was extended until 2036, data from the site showed.
AFP was not able to immediately verify this information.
The Antonov-24 is a popular, Soviet-designed turboprop plane that first entered into service in 1959.
Russia has taken steps to switch from Soviet aircraft to modern jets in recent years, but ageing light aircraft are still widely used in far-flung regions, with accidents frequent.
The incident comes just days after a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday, killing 31 and injuring more than 170 people.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2413561135d4e2b.png?r=135959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926262/at-least-11-civilians-killed-as-thailand-f-16-jet-bombs-cambodian-targets-after-border-clash-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 civilians killed as Thailand F-16 jet bombs Cambodian targets after border clash escalates</strong></a><br><p>Thailand scrambled an F-16 fighter jet to bomb targets in Cambodia on Thursday after artillery volleys from both sides killed at least 11 civilians, as border tension boiled over into rare armed conflict between the Southeast Asian countries.
Both blamed each other for starting a morning clash at a disputed area of the border, which quickly escalated from small arms fire to heavy shelling in at least six locations 209 kilometres apart along a frontier where sovereignty has been disputed for more than a century.
Thailand positioned six F-16 fighter jets in an uncommon combat deployment, one of which was mobilised to strike a Cambodian military target, among measures Cambodia’s foreign ministry called “reckless and brutal military aggression”.
Thailand’s military said the use of air power was to strike with precision.
The worst fighting between the countries in 13 years came after Thailand on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Phnom Penh and expelled Cambodia’s envoy, in response to a second Thai soldier losing a limb to a landmine that Bangkok alleged had been laid recently by rival troops.
The two countries have been braced for conflict since the killing of a Cambodian soldier late in May during a brief skirmish, with troops reinforced on both sides of the border amid a full-blown diplomatic crisis that brought Thailand’s fragile coalition government to the brink of collapse.
Thailand said there were 12 fatalities in three Thai provinces, 11 of them civilians, including an eight-year-old boy. Authorities said 31 people were injured on Thursday. The number of Cambodian casualties was unclear.
“We condemn this — using heavy weapons without a clear target, outside of conflict zones … the use of force and did not adhere to international law,” Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.
“We remain committed to peaceful means and there should be discussions, but what happened was a provocation and we had to defend ourselves.”
‘Premeditated military aggression’
Thailand’s Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin told reporters a hospital was hit by shelling in Surin province, an attack he said should be considered “a war crime”.
Cambodian government, defence and foreign ministry officials at a press conference gave no indication of fatalities sustained or any estimate of the number of people evacuated.
In a letter to Pakistan, the current president of the United Nations Security Council, Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet urged the body to convene a meeting to stop what he called “unprovoked and premeditated military aggression” by Thailand in violation of international law.
As clashes spread to different border areas, Thai villagers, including children and the elderly, fled to concrete shelters fortified with sandbags and car tires.
“How many rounds have been fired? It’s countless,” an unidentified woman in Surin province told the Thai Public Broadcasting Service while hiding in the shelter as gunfire and explosions were heard in the background.

Video footage showed a plume of thick black smoke rising from a gas station in the neighbouring Sisaket province, as firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze.
 


Thailand has evacuated more than 40,000 people from border areas, moving many to temporary shelters, where elderly people and small children gathered on floor mats as authorities prepared meals and unloaded food and bottled water from trucks.
“I’m worried about my children,” said Suphap Wongwai, an evacuee in Surin province. “My children are scared and crying.”
Decades of disputes
Thailand and Cambodia have bickered for decades over jurisdiction of various undemarcated points along their 817km land border, with ownership of the ancient Hindu temples Ta Moan Thom and the 11th century Preah Vihear central to the disputes.
Preah Vihear was awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1962 but tension escalated in 2008 after Cambodia attempted to list it as a Unesco World Heritage site.
That led to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths.
Cambodia in June said it had asked the ICJ to resolve its disputes with Thailand, which says it has never recognised the court’s jurisdiction and prefers a bilateral approach.
Thailand’s use of a fighter jet underlines its military advantage over Cambodia in terms of size and range of defence hardware.
The clashes have caused jitters in the region, with the Philippines and Vietnam calling for restraint and China expressing willingness to play a role in promoting de-escalation.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Thailand and Cambodia are members, said he would speak to leaders of both countries.
“The least we can expect from them is to just stand down and hopefully to try and enter into negotiations,” Anwar said.
The clashes erupted hours after a downgrade in diplomatic relations between the two countries following a series of landmine injuries to Thai soldiers patrolling border areas.
Thailand accused Cambodia of placing the mines recently, which Phnom Penh dismissed as baseless.
De-mining groups estimate as many as 4-6 million landmines remain in Cambodia following years of civil war.
Landmines
The clashes began early on Thursday near the disputed Ta Moan Thom temple along the eastern border between Cambodia and Thailand, around 360km from the Thai capital Bangkok.
“Artillery shell fell on people’s homes,” Sutthirot Charoenthanasak, district chief of Kabcheing in Surin province, told Reuters, describing the firing by the Cambodian side.
“Two people have died,” he said, adding that district authorities had evacuated 40,000 civilians from 86 villages near the border to safer locations.
Thailand’s military said Cambodia deployed a surveillance drone before sending troops with heavy weapons to an area near the temple.
Cambodian troops opened fire and two Thai soldiers were wounded, a Thai army spokesperson said, adding that Cambodia had used multiple weapons, including rocket launchers.
A spokesperson for Cambodia’s defence ministry, however, said there had been an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops and Cambodian forces had responded in self-defence.
Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said the situation was delicate. “We have to be careful,” he told reporters. “We will follow international law.”
An attempt by Thai premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra to resolve the recent tensions via a call with Cambodia’s influential former prime minister Hun Sen, the contents of which were leaked, kicked off a political storm in Thailand, leading to her suspension by a court.
Hun Sen said in a Facebook post that two Cambodian provinces had come under shelling from the Thai military.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:34</small></div><hr>
