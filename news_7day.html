CERN, one of the world’s largest and most respected centres for scientific research, was established in 1954 on the principle of “science for peace”, according to its website. Pakistan became CERN’s associate member on July 31, 2015, contributing to the centre’s projects as a “significant partner”. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is the lead agency for the Pak-CERN collaboration.
“During the visit, a team of five top experts from CERN met with the chairman of the PAEC and toured various science and technology institutions,” a statement from the FO said.
“The purpose of these visits was to assess Pakistan’s progress in the field of science and technology.”
The institutions include the National Centre for Physics, Heavy Mechanical Complex-3, Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, National Institute for Laser and Optronics and other advanced facilities, the statement read.
“Through its associate membership, Pakistan has gained significant benefits — advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge, fostering technological development, and training a new generation of scientists and engineers,” it further noted.
 






In 2022, a task force of the CERN held meetings with different entities in Pakistan to review the associate membership.
Pakistan has attained numerous benefits from the membership, such as an increased number of engineering contracts to support CERN programmes, which are beneficial for the country’s industrial sector, human resources development and sharing of techniques and technology in key areas, besides numerous intellectual benefits.</p><small>2025-08-29 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/291157583a0b57b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938129/ctd-arrests-three-most-wanted-sra-terrorists-in-sindhs-jamshoro' target='_blank'><strong>CTD arrests three ‘most-wanted’ SRA terrorists in Sindh’s Jamshoro</strong></a><br><p>The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Hyderabad has arrested three “most-wanted” terrorists affiliated with the banned Sindhu Desh Revolutionary Army (SRA) in Jamshoro district during an intelligence-based operation, a statement from CTD said on Friday.
In 2020, the interior ministry banned the SRA, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Aresar Group (JSQM-A), and Sindhu Desh Liberation Army (SLA) under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“CTD Hyderabad established a network to eliminate these terrorists through which information about them was obtained,” the statement said, adding that they were planning to carry out bomb blasts and targeted killings in Hyderabad city.
“The terrorists of the banned SRA were wanted in the cases related to firing on cargo trawlers going to Punjab, especially in the areas of district Sujawal.”
The statement detailed that the terrorists were found to possess a hand grenade, explosive material, detonator, ball bearings, nut bolts, remote control, battery, and prohibited weapons, including an 8MM rifle and bullets, which were confiscated following the operation.
The arrested terrorists confessed to carrying out multiple attacks, including planting bombs on railway tracks and targeting law enforcement personnel, while admitting to working under the direct instructions of SRA’s central leadership.
It added that one of the arrested terrorists revealed during interrogation that he and his group had been assigned 14 tasks, including targeted killings of police officials and bomb blasts in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Kotri, and other areas.
Per the statement, the terrorist further revealed that on August 18,  a remote-controlled bomb was planted on railway tracks near Hyderabad, while another bomb was planted on August 28 in Latifabad but was successfully defused by the CTD.
“He disclosed that he had been receiving direct funding from SRA leadership abroad through Hawala/Hundi channels for carrying out terrorist activities and confessed that he had been providing logistical support to other SRA operatives in Sindh and was actively involved in recruiting youth for terrorist activities.
“The arrested terrorist has admitted that his group was planning a series of bomb blasts in Sindh to disrupt peace, and was also planning to carry out an attack on September 6,” the statement added.
Last week, CTD claimed that it unearthed a network of India’s intelligence agency, the Res­earch and Analysis Wing (RAW), which used Pakistanis and a separatist outfit in Sindh to carry out the targeted killing of a well-known soc­ial worker in Badin district.
In April, CTD Shaheed Benazirabad district claimed to have arrested a suspected operative of the SRA.</p><small>2025-08-29 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2912250573cef2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937551/the-power-divide-that-shapes-womens-lives-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>The power divide that shapes women’s lives in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>Washing and cooking at odd hours, storing food for days, timetabling routines — this is what the everyday life of hundreds of thousands of women looks like in Pakistan, who are forced to manage their lives around a tight electricity schedule. Like most other essentials, access to energy in Pakistan is not gender-neutral. And like every other instance, it is women who have to face the brunt of unreliable electricity, from interrupted housework to limited mobility and digital exclusion.
Nowhere is this clearer than in Lahore, where neighbourhood boundaries and social hierarchies create starkly unequal “energy lives”. To dig deeper, I set out to understand how this gender-energy nexus actually plays out across the city with my colleagues at the University of Cambridge and the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
Building on previous research on electricity demand in upper-class areas, we combined surveys, in-depth interviews, and neighbourhood walks to study five low-income neighbourhoods — Bahar Colony, Liaqatabad, Peer Colony, Charar Pind and Gajju Matta.

Our aim was simple: to understand how women in these ‘peripheries’ — socially and/or structurally marginalised low-income areas — secure and use energy at home, at work and in public, and what that means for their daily lives and their overall empowerment.
A city of uneven development
Lahore’s rich colonial history, post-colonial expansion and decades of rural-to-urban migration have produced a city with distinct enclaves. Affluent gated communities, older cantonment neighbourhoods and industrial belts sit alongside dense slums and semi-informal settlements that blur the line between ‘planned’ and ‘unplanned’.

This diversity is marked by stark contrasts in infrastructure provision: while the city’s more affluent housing developments typically enjoy more reliable power supply, piped gas and maintained roads, many low-income and loosely planned areas — even those adjacent to affluent urban cores — remain peripheral and underserved. The result is spatially uneven energy access with distinctly gendered effects.
For example, in Charar Pind, a narrow-alleyed village, women belonging to low-income backgrounds are encircled by Lahore’s prime real estate community, the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). Despite their proximity to the shiny suburban locality, they rely on patchy connections and precarious services in their own settlements.
“There is mostly no gas in the morning, so my father and brother leave for work without breakfast … we can only cook when gas is available,” a participant told us. “How can we use a heater?”
Such disparities translate into compounded time poverty for women, revealing how uneven urban development materialises into uneven energy provision.
The power divide
While stark differences exist in energy services between urban cores and the outskirts, our study found that internally, even these peripheries are diverse.
In Liaqatabad alone, household incomes varied 20-fold, while Gajju Matta village, located in the Nishtar tehsil of Lahore, recorded the lowest average incomes and the weakest provision of basic utilities — roads, drainage and electricity. This heterogeneity undermines any idea of “the urban poor” as a single, uniform group and signals that geographical location and local governance shape material conditions as much as household income does.
A deeper dive into our five low-income neighbourhoods revealed that ownership of electrical appliances was consistently lower in households with lower income, tenancy residence (as opposed to house ownership), and less educated women (below grade 10 education).
There was also a divide among those who owned appliances; households in Bahar Colony — located less than a kilometre south of what used to be the family residence of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his brother Nawaz Sharif — reported high access to refrigerators/ freezers at 98.5 per cent, and air-conditioners at 53pc, while Gajju Matta lagged sharply with 68.4pc fridges and freezers and 9.2pc ACs.
Cooking appliances such as microwaves, rice-cookers and kettles were also clustered near urban cores — 86.4pc in Bahar Colony and 60pc in Peer Colony — and thinned out at the edge — 35.7pc in Gajju Matta.
 


In terms of digital access, we found that while women had less access to mobile phones and internet/ wifi compared to men across all sites, this gap exhibited significant geographic underpinnings. In Bahar Colony, 88pc of households had at least one woman who owned a mobile phone, while 79pc had at least one woman using the internet. In Gajju Matta, these figures dipped to 35pc and 12pc, respectively.
“All of us have mobile phones,” a Bahar Colony respondent told us. “I have this small keypad phone; I like it because I don’t know how to use smartphones, but my kids have smartphones.”
 

Domestic electrical appliances owned by a household in Peer colony. A second-hand fridge bought by the resident working as a housemaid from her employer on instalments.

Another woman in Charar Pind described stricter control: “My uncle’s [phone], only he has the internet … I’m not allowed. Besides, we can’t afford so many phones.”
Women’s workplace location also matters. Women who travelled farther — to core neighbourhoods or the city centre — reported higher access to digital tools, i.e. mobile 73pc and internet/ wi-fi 50pc, than women working from home or within their colonies, of which 56pc and 40pc had access to mobile phones and internet, respectively.
Urban to rural energy flow
Interestingly, the proximity to core areas raised the odds of owning an appliance, simultaneously building energy-related knowledge and aspirations. Many low-income women employed in domestic services in Model Town or DHA learnt to operate appliances they did not own, including washing machines, microwaves, kettles, and air conditioners.
“No one in our area knows how to use these modern appliances. We learn from our workplaces,” a woman in Charar Pind explained, before listing the foods she had learnt to cook and the hygiene routines she had adopted.
Similarly, a nurse from Bahar Colony added: “I’ve learnt how to use a microwave … kettle, AC, which I don’t have at home, but I know how to use.”
Sometimes these ties translated into material gains. “I bought my employer’s old fridge on instalments,” said another resident of Charar Pind who works as a housemaid in a nearby DHA home. “We didn’t have a fridge before … now, they take a percentage of my salary as instalments.”
According to DHA’s Security Office, more than 300 women enter the posh neighbourhood daily through barricaded gates from Charar Pind and Peer Colony for income-generating work — movements that are closely monitored and individually logged. These figures underline both the opportunity and the asymmetry: affluent areas rely on women’s labour from their less-affluent neighbourhoods, yet their access remains contingent on the discretion of estate authorities.

Living near high-income areas also improved women’s access to public amenities that depend on reliable energy — healthcare, religious facilities, and even recreational spaces and parks. In proximal sites, 72.4pc of women reported access to health facilities (versus 33.6pc in the control), 52pc reported access to religious facilities (versus 28.5pc), and 36.6pc to open/green spaces (versus 18.3pc).
Women in these sites were also more likely to be in paid work, with only 27pc unemployed, compared to the 53pc unemployed in other low-income areas, highlighting the glaring link between employment, mobility and infrastructures.
Gendered norms and the salience of identity
During the course of our research, we also found that women’s electricity access was shaped by both social identity and location. Even within the same household, age and status matter: younger women — especially daughters-in-law in joint families — often have less autonomy over appliance use and electricity spending.
“My mother-in-law washes her clothes in the machine; I wash mine by hand … she doesn’t allow me to use the machine,” said a woman residing in Peer Colony, situated near DHA Phase 1 and the cantonment.

Religion also emerged as a key factor. In interviews at Gajju Matta, some Muslim respondents described strict limits on mobility. “We are Syeds … we never go outside. My husband brings everything,” one woman said.
At the community level, mosques across the five sites chosen by us offered no dedicated space for women, curtailing their access to public religious facilities and to the information flows and networks that form around them. Meanwhile, churches in Christian-majority localities did provide such spaces.
On average, Christian women in our sample reported higher scores for control over finances, electricity decisions and freedom of movement than Muslim women. This shows how religious norms and local institutional designs can combine to shape access to public and energy-dependent spaces.

Our data showed that the link between household prosperity and women’s energy empowerment is not linear. In poorer households, below the 25th percentile, more women worked for money; those who contributed 50pc or more of household income reported far greater self-autonomy over electricity purchases at 61pc and freedom of movement at 66pc, as compared to women contributing less than half at 26pc and 27pc, respectively.
Meanwhile, some unemployed women in financially stable low-income households possessed more appliances at home but had less mobility and weaker public-space access. This shows that household income, employment, and access to energy across private/public spaces interlink in complex, context-specific ways, shaped by norms, bargaining power, and place.
Why these numbers matter
Not all city neighbourhoods are created equal. Our study shows that in Lahore, a woman’s location on the map shapes her “energy life” — whether she has access to labour-saving appliances, how long she endures load-shedding, which jobs she can reach, and whether schools, clinics and parks are within safe, affordable reach.
These differences are layered with identity, including income, class, religion, and employment, thus creating complex intersections of gender, energy, and space use. Seeing energy as a purely technical issue undermines these social realities.
Moreover, treating cities as uniform masks these disparities. By mapping how energy flows, and doesn’t flow, from the home to the city, and both within and across neighbourhoods, policymakers and planners can better address the root causes of gendered energy inequities, rather than offering one-size-fits-all solutions. This is essential for Pakistan to move towards a fairer and more sustainable energy future.

As Israel and Iran’s exchange of missiles threw flight paths into disarray this year, the skies above Afghanistan offered carriers a less turbulent and faster route to ply — for a flat $700 overflight fee, according to industry insiders.
The US aviation authority eased restrictions on the country’s airspace and paved the way for commercial flyovers in 2023, two years after the Taliban takeover.
Airspace that had long been avoided — as the country endured four decades of war and shifting powerbrokers — suddenly became a viable option, allowing carriers to abbreviate routes and save on fuel costs.
But it was not until the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June that the route really gained traction, allowing the Taliban government to potentially rake in millions.
Faced with shuttered airspace over Iran and Iraq, and unpredictable openings and closures across the Middle East, airlines saw reason to divert course and found refuge over Afghanistan.
While missiles clogged the neighbouring airspace, “the risk of flying over Afghanistan (was) virtually zero”, said France-based aerospace and defence consultant Xavier Tytelman.
“It’s like flying over the sea.”
May’s average of 50 planes cutting through Afghanistan each day skyrocketed to around 280 after June 13, when the Iran-Israel war erupted, data from tracking website Flightradar24 showed.
Since then, in any given day, more than 200 planes often traverse Afghanistan — equivalent to roughly $4.2 million a month, though this figure is difficult to verify as the authorities do not publish budgets and have declined to comment.
Opaque transactions
While not a princely sum in terms of government revenue, the overflight fees offer a much-needed boost to Afghanistan’s coffers as it contends with a massive humanitarian crisis and a war-battered economy.
Around 85 per cent of Afghanistan’s population lives on less than one dollar a day, according to the UN, and nearly one in four Afghans aged 15 to 29 are unemployed.
The World Bank says overflight fees contributed to modest growth in Afghanistan’s economy in 2024, before the route began attracting carriers needing to bypass Iran.
International airlines returned to Afghanistan starting in 2023, with Turkish Airlines, flydubai, and Air Arabia making almost daily flights from Afghan airports.
Others, such as Singapore Airlines, Air France, Aeroflot, Air Canada and Swiss Air, fly over Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif or Kandahar — as practicality outweighs the risks, which remain.
Consultant Tytelman warned that Afghanistan is still a less than ideal place to land in case of technical or medical emergencies, with potential complications due to a lack of spare parts and dilapidated health care services.
Yet he noted, “planes are landing in Kabul every day”.
Airlines were loath to discuss the mechanics of paying the Taliban government, which remains isolated by many countries in part over its restrictions on women.
Multiple companies contacted by AFP said they do not provide overflight payment information.
Afghanistan’s aviation officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and would not confirm the overflight fees or the process by which they are paid.
“Companies are not formally prohibited from trading with Afghanistan, as US sanctions target only certain Taliban officials,” a World Bank expert told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
However, “some abstain out of fear of being associated with the ruling power”, he added.
Industry insiders speaking on condition of anonymity said the $700 overflight fees are paid to third-party intermediaries, such as the United Arab Emirates-based GAAC Holding, which manages airports in Afghanistan, or overflight brokers.
Some airlines may now even pay directly, as more countries develop diplomatic ties with the Taliban government.
Reinforcing authority
Only Russia has officially recognised the Taliban authorities, who are hamstrung by frozen assets, sanctions on individuals and a lack of trust in the banking sector.
Against such economic headwinds, the airspace revenue stream “is helpful for the cash-strapped current administration”, said Sulaiman Bin Shah, former deputy minister of industry and commerce in the ousted government and founder of the Catalysts Afghanistan consultancy.
But Bin Shah emphasised that the overflight traffic offers more than just financial benefits, as it increases normalisation of the Taliban authorities.
“It reinforces their grip on state functions and supports the image of a functioning government, even without formal international recognition,” he said.
“So while the income itself is not transformative, it plays a meaningful role in the administration’s economic narrative and political positioning.”</p><small>2025-08-29 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/29111937f32a58d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937997/ogra-orders-shift-to-digital-payments' target='_blank'><strong>Ogra orders shift to digital payments</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Thursday directed all licensed entities in the oil and gas sector to ensure adoption of digital payment solutions for all transactions by Oct 31 as part of the government’s push towards a cashless economy.
According to the directive, oil marketing companies, gas utilities, CNG stations, LPG and LNG operators, refineries and lubricant marketers must introduce and prominently display digital payment options — particularly the State Bank of Pakistan’s Raast QR code — at their outlets.
“No outlet will be allowed to refuse customers opting for digital transactions. Full compliance is required by Oct 31, 2025,” the regulator said. While consumers will still have the option to pay in cash, businesses will be bound to accept digital payments.
Ogra said the initiative supports the State Bank’s digitisation programme and is aimed at improving financial inclusion, transparency and operational efficiency across the energy sector. Companies have been advised to coordinate with banks, microfinance institutions or electronic money providers to obtain free-of-cost Raast QR codes for timely rollout.

“This initiative will facilitate consumers and strengthen Pakistan’s digital payment ecosystem,” the regulator noted.
The directive applies to the entire upstream, midstream and downstream value chain, covering marketing, refining, transportation, storage, transmission and distribution of petroleum products and natural gas, including CNG, LPG and LNG.
 
 

Officials said the decision had been under consideration before the FY26 budget under the direct supervision of the premier as part of the government’s “war on cash.”
Petrol pumps nationwide — from Karachi to Khyber and Azad Kashmir to Chaman — will be required to offer QR code, debit and credit card, and mobile payment options alongside cash transactions.
Unlike point-of-sale (POS) systems, which require investment in machines and maintenance, QR codes and similar digital solutions involve minimal cost. Authorities cited the experience of India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, where similar measures had expanded cashless transactions significantly.
Despite longstanding legal requirements, tens of thousands of restaurants and businesses — some located near the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) headquarters in Islamabad — continue to issue paper invoices and resist digital payments.
Separately, the government is pushing legislation in parliament to introduce digital tracking of petroleum products from import and production to retail sales. The measure is aimed at curbing smuggling and adulteration, which are estimated to cause annual revenue losses of Rs300-500bn, while also damaging engines and the environment.

The Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts are a federal paramilitary force responsible for internal security in GB and for guarding its borders.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Diamer Abdul Hameed told Dawn.com that the terrorists attacked the GB Scouts checkpoint situated at the KKH near Chilas of Diamer district on Friday at 12:15 am.
“Unknown armed men fired at the checkpoint from an elevated hilltop position, injuring three scout personnel, two of whom succumbed to their injuries later,” he said. “A total of nine people were present at the checkpoint when the attack took place.”
The deceased were identified as Naib Subedar Khush Dad and Havaldar Ashraf, while Lance Naik Sajid Ali sustained abdominal injury and is under treatment, he said.
“The police, led by the deputy inspector general and the district police officer, responded immediately and visited the incident site within the next 15-20 minutes, travelling there from Chilas,” he said.
The injured were immediately shifted to the Regional Headquarters (RHQ) Hospital in Chilas, SSP Hameed added.
The police recovered two grenades and 10 spent shells from the site of the firing at the hilltop, while 17 bullet holes were found at the checkpoint. The terrorists managed to flee the area.
Following the incident, Elite Force and additional police were dispatched to the area to strengthen the post and chase the attackers, the SSP said.
“The police have started carrying out raids to arrest the culprits and have raided many areas,” Hameed said, adding that no organisation had so far claimed the responsibility for the attack.
The incident occurred in the same area when ten people lost their lives and 20 passengers received injuries when an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire near Chilas in Diamer in December 2023.
GB’s Interior Minister Shamsul Haq Lone said in a statement that the terrorists targeted the KKH checkpoint in the dark of night.
“Immediately after the attack, a large contingent of security forces reached the spot and sealed the area and expanded the search operation to pursue the terrorists,” he said.
“There had been no prior intelligence regarding the attack.”
He said that the soldier injured in the incident has been shifted to the hospital for medical treatment, and his condition is out of danger.
“The GB government would pursue the terrorists and bring them to their ultimate fate,” Lone said, adding that those who attempt to sabotage the peace of this otherwise peaceful region are enemies of the country and the nation.
The minister further said the GB Scouts checkpoint had been set up on December 2, 2023, following a firing incident on a passenger bus in which nine people were killed and 21 were injured.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has taken strict notice of the tragic incident and ordered the pursuit of the perpetrators.
The spokesperson termed the attack an act of extreme cowardice.
On July 21 this year, armed men martyred a Federal Constabulary soldier at a forest checkpoint along the KKH in GB’s Diamer district, according to police.</p><small>2025-08-29 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/29105214ff80c66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938019/fbr-moves-to-tighten-e-commerce-oversight' target='_blank'><strong>FBR moves to tighten e-commerce oversight</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has tightened compliance protocols by mandating quarterly return filings from couriers and payment intermediaries responsible for collecting or deducting withholding tax.
The revenue authority issued draft amendments to the Income Tax Rules, 2002, through SRO 1634 of 2025. The draft will be finalised after receiving feedback from stakeholders.
The proposed protocols will only apply to domestic e-commerce outfits and couriers.
Under the proposed amendments, in line with Sub-Section 2 of Section 165 and Sub-Section 1 of section 165C, any courier or payment intermediary tasked with tax collection or deduction under Division II or Division III of Part V of Chapter X of the Ordinance, or under Chapter XII, must submit a quarterly statement. These are to be filed electronically using the format prescribed in Part X of the Second Schedule to the rules.
 
 

The deadlines for filing are set as April 20 for the quarter ending March 31, July 20 for the quarter ending June 30, Oct 20 for the quarter ending Sept 30, and Jan 20 for the quarter ending Dec 31.
In a parallel move aimed at strengthening oversight of digital commerce, the FBR has also imposed a monthly reporting requirement on online marketplaces handling digitally ordered goods and services.
According to Sub-Section 2 of Section 165C, digital platforms must submit detailed monthly statements covering both transactional and aggregate data of registered sellers.
Additionally, if an online marketplace provides courier services, it will also be required to file statements under Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 44, read with Part X of the Second Schedule. The FBR has specified that these filings must be submitted using two designated formats: Form A1 and Form A2.

Lyles and Alfred were but two of the cream of track and field’s elite who rose to the top in a scintillating night of action at a 25,000 sell-out Letzigrund Stadium.
American Lyles became the first track athlete to win six Diamond League Final titles by producing a strong finish to outpace Botswana rival Letsile Tebogo for victory in the men’s 200m.

Lyles, the reigning world champion in both the 100 and 200, trailed Tebogo coming off the corner before reeling in his rival to cross the line in 19.74 and win by 0.02 seconds.
“Six in a row, the most in track!” Lyles said.
“That’s pretty cool, I’m not going to lie. I saw Letsile lean on the finish line and I leaned on the finish line but I knew I won. The most important is getting wins. I know if I panicked I was not going to win. If you are tight you are done for.”
Lyles had to settle for bronze in the 200 at the Paris Olympics, behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenneth Bednarek. But he said he feels ready to defend both his individual titles at the worlds in Tokyo next month.
“I know I’m fit, being able to run the whole 200. I’ve got top end speed,” Lyles said.
Tebogo said Lyles has become humbler since he beat the American in Paris.
“You have to let the legs do the talk, because the more you talk and you cannot prove it, it means you only talk, you do not prove yourself,” Tebogo said.
“But for me, I do not talk, I just let the legs do its thing. I think now, Lyles is humble. He knows what can happen in this sport. He wins today, tomorrow, he can lose it. I believe since Paris, he has been humble, he has not been talking so much.”
Alfred, the Olympic 100m champion, cruised to victory in 10.76 in her first race in more than a month. She had withdrawn from two Diamond League meets due to what organisers said was an injury.
 






“I am surpassing the questions about my injuries,” Alfred said. “It is my first race back in five weeks so it is one step forward for me. I am not thinking about the time.
“I feel like I want to add another gold in my collection. The season has been long, but when I compare myself now and at the beginning of the season, I am much fitter than before and also mentally, I am in the right place where I want to be.”
Tia Clayton of Jamaica was second in 10.84 and Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith third in 10.94.
Twenty-six Diamond League champions were unveiled at the Letzigrund Stadium as quality oozed through at every turn as athletes fine-tuned preparations for the Tokyo worlds.
Athletes competed for points at the 14 previous Diamond League meetings in a bid to qualify for the two-day finale in Zurich. The winners were presented with a diamond-shaped trophy and a $50,000 cheque.
American Christian Coleman outleaned Akani Simbine of South Africa and Jamaican Ackeem Blake on the line to win the men’s 100m in 9.97. Simbine clocked 9.98 and Blake 9.99.
“This victory feels amazing. Let’s keep winning,” Coleman said. “In America we have five, six guys that should be in the final in Tokyo, so if I should get the opportunity, I want to come home with a medal.”
American Brittany Brown won the women’s 200m in a season’s best 22.13, while Asher-Smith took second (22.18), and Marie-Josee Ta Lou-Smith, who was disqualified from the 100 for a false start, finished third.
‘Greedy’ Warholm
Femke Bol of the Netherlands continued her dominance in the women’s 400 hurdles, winning in a meet record 52.18 to secure her fifth overall Diamond League title. Bol has won 30 straight Diamond League races, dating back to 2020.
“Another Diamond League season undefeated,” Bol said. “It’s really cool.”
 






Norway’s Karsten Warholm, the world record holder and three-time world champion, then nonchalantly repeated Bol’s feat, bettering his 2019 mark with a new meet record of 46.70sec.
“That was my target for this meeting,“ said Warholm. “I’m on the right path for Tokyo. I have three titles as world champions and I want more. I’m greedy.”
Two loaded short hurdles races went the way of in-form American Cordell Tinch for the men over 110m and Jamaican Ackera Nugent (12.30sec) in the women’s 100m.
Tinch underlined his credentials as the favourite for Tokyo with a winning time of 12.92sec, equalling the meet record — and then world record — set by double Olympic champion Roger Kingdom back in 1989.
“It is about consistency,” said Tinch, who set a world lead of 12.87 in May. “All I have done this year has been the next big moment, every time I get into something, it is another big moment. And I am ready for the next one. I am ready to go to Tokyo and be great.”
Niels Laros pulled away over the final 100m to easily win the men’s 1,500 in a Dutch record 3:29.20, a perfect tune-up for the world championships for the 20-year-old.
“I know that I have a good kick and I relied on that,” Laros said. “I am excited. I am going into Tokyo with a lot of confidence. I am dreaming about the podium.”
One of the most competitive events on the men’s circuit is the 800m, with athletes edging ever nearer to David Rudisha’s world record of 1:40.91.
Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyonyi faded in the home stretch in Zurich, but just managed to hold on for victory in 1:42.37, 0.05sec ahead of Britain’s Max Burgin, with Canada’s world champion Marco Arop taking third.
There was a Swiss record of 1:55.91 for in-form Audrey Werro in the women’s 800m.
Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser trumped Marileidy Paulino for the women’s 400m title, winning in a meet record of 48.70sec, while American Jacory Patterson clocked a personal best of 43.85sec for the men’s one-lap honours.
The stand-out performance in the field was a huge, world-leading best of 91.51m by Germany’s Julian Weber in the javelin, with India’s world champion Neeraj Chopra finishing second.
There was no such joy for Japan’s reigning Olympic and world champion Haruka Kitaguchi, who managed a best of only 60.72m for sixth and last spot in a competition won by Greece’s Elina Tzengko (64.57).

But the day’s most dramatic moments belonged to Coco Gauff, who wiped away tears mid-match before rallying to beat Donna Vekic and avenge her Olympic heartbreak from Paris.
Second seed Swiatek, fresh from her Wimbledon triumph and Cincinnati title, was forced to grind it out against unseeded Suzan Lamens in a 6-1 4-6 6-4 thriller on Arthur Ashe Stadium that proved far trickier than expected.
“It got a bit complicated in the second set, but I’m happy that I could reset and start playing better in the third,” said the 2022 champion, who sealed victory with an ace to set up a clash with 29th seed Anna Kalinskaya.
World number one Sinner had no such trouble, dismantling Australian Alexei Popyrin 6-3 6-2 6-2 in ruthless fashion to book a third-round date with Canadian 27th seed Denis Shapovalov.
 






Osaka, the 23rd seed, rolled past American Hailey Baptiste 6-3 6-1 to reach the tournament’s third round for the first time since 2021.
“I was just really trying to focus and not give her any free points and just be positive,” said the two-time champion. “I’m really excited to be moving better.”
She then weighed in on the raging debate at the tournament after Wednesday’s heated on-court row between local hope Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko, condemning the Latvian for her comments toward her opponent.
The night session brought high drama as defending champion Gauff struggled with her serve against Vekic, the Croatian who had beaten her at last year’s Paris Olympics.
After weeping into her towel following a service break in the first set, Gauff found inspiration from an unlikely source in the stands.
“I saw her and … she helped me pull it out,” Gauff said of gymnastics icon Simone Biles.
“I was thinking like, ‘If she can go on a six-inch beam and do that with all the pressures of the world, then I can hit the ball in the court.’”
 






Stefanos Tsitsipas was knocked out by Germany’s Daniel Altmaier in the final match of the day on the Grandstand, with the Greek 26th seed falling 7-6(5) 1-6 4-6 6-3 7-5 in a marathon that lasted well over four hours.
German third seed Alexander Zverev beat British qualifier Jacob Fearnley 6-4 6-4 6-4 in the first evening session match on Louis Armstrong Stadium and will next face familiar foe Felix Auger-Aliassime.
Two early finishes allowed organisers to move a highly-anticipated first-round doubles match involving 45-year-old Venus Williams to the second-largest stadium, where fans packed the house.
Seven-times major winner Williams, who lost in the mixed doubles and women’s singles first rounds, found inspiration from Canadian partner Leylah Fernandez as they beat sixth seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez 7-6(4) 6-3.
“This is the best partner I’ve ever played with outside Serena,” said Williams, who this summer became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. “We’re a great team.”
 






Australian hope Alex de Minaur beat Japan’s Shintaro Mochizuki 6-2 6-4 6-2, but there was bad news for his compatriot Maya Joint, who fell 7-6(2) 6-2 to eighth seed Amanda Anisimova in the final match on Louis Armstrong.</p><small>2025-08-29 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/29090355ab79585.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938034/karachi-inequitable-nfc-impact' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi: inequitable NFC impact</strong></a><br><p>BORN in the name of devolution, propagated as people’s rights, and celebrated as a victory for the deprived, the seventh National Finance Commission award has been nothing of the sort.
Its birth in 2010 coincided with the passage of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which also created ambiguity about the role of the local governments (LGs), paving the way for the recentralisation of powers by the provincial governments.
Rather than bringing governance closer to the people, the seventh NFC award and the 18th Ame­ndment took away whatever devolution of resou­rces and powers existed with the LGs at that time.
In 1999, when the federal government abolished the octroi and zila tax (OZT) collection by the LGs, it introduced a 2.5 per cent increase in the GST on goods. A transparent mechanism for direct transfers to the LGs was introduced to compensate for their revenue losses. Later, the Distribution of Revenues & Grants-in-aid Order of 2006 fixed these direct transfers at one-sixth of GST collections.
 
 

Had that system continued, Karachi would have received Rs190 billion in 2024-25 as a direct transfer from GST alone (as compensation for the OZT). Other district governments in Sindh, such as those in Ghotki, Hyderabad and Thatta, would also have received direct transfers of Rs4,456 million, Rs4,486m and Rs3,618m respectively.
This right of the LGs was usurped through the seventh NFC and merged into the federal divisible pool. The provinces were allowed to use the LGs’ share as they pleased. Karachi, being the largest collector of OZT, was the worst affected, receiving meagre amounts totalling less than Rs200bn from 2010-11 to 2024-25, against its due share of Rs1,236.7bn. Karachi suffered a colossal loss of more than Rs1,000bn, or one trillion rupees, after the seventh NFC under the OZT head alone.

The seventh NFC award and 18th Amendment took away whatever devolution of resources and powers existed with the LGs.

‘Democracy’, ‘devolution of power’ under the 18th Amendment and ‘equitable distribution of resources’ under the seventh NFC were meant only for those with political power in the provinces. After becoming mega-rich under the seventh NFC, the provinces were not bound to give equitable shares to the cities or districts.
 
 

Sindh spent 3,871bn in development funds from 2010-11 to 2024-25. Comprising 37pc of Sindh’s population, Karachi was entitled to Rs1,416.6bn, but received only Rs472bn (a deficit of Rs944.6bn). The federal government’s PSDP from 2010-11 to 2024-25 amounted to Rs8,967bn.
Constituting 8.4pc of the country’s population, Karachi should have received Rs756.8bn. However, it received only Rs340bn (a deficit of Rs416.2bn). The total development deficit was Rs1,360.9bn (almost one and a half trillion rupees) from 2010-11 to 2024-25.
Due to such flaws in the 18th Amendment, the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) has been dead since 2009. The subjects of LGs have been taken back by the provincial government, including water, sewerage, solid waste management, master plan, building control, development agencies, transport/ mass transit, land control, education, health, etc. Social indicators, including education and health, have nosedived since then.
The Infrastructure Development Cess has been collected since 1994 on goods at Karachi’s ports for the development and maintenance of the infrastructure that the carriers use when they enter Karachi via national highways. Rather than creating a fund for Karachi’s infrastructure, all the collection under the IDC is merged illegally into the provincial account. Last year, it was Rs170bn. The total IDC collection, since the cess’s inception, is estimated to be around Rs1,000bn or Rs1tr.
All these amounts, ie, direct transfers from GST taken away by the seventh NFC, deficit in development funds and misappropriation of IDC come to Rs3,360bn or over Rs3tr. It is about three times the amount of the infrastructure funding gap identified by the World Bank: “Karachi requires an estimated $9-10bn [around Rs 1,050bn in 2017] to bridge its service delivery and infrastructure gaps. Without this, the city’s livability and competitiveness will continue to deteriorate, limiting its ability to drive Pakistan’s growth” (Transforming Karachi into a Liveable and Competitive Megacity, 2017, World Bank).
All these years, we believed that: “All issues of Karachi, including water supply, drainage, sewage, public transport and solid waste disposal, will be addressed at once” as the then prime minister Imran Khan said, when announcing Rs1,100bn for the Karachi Transformation Plan in September 2020.
In a similar vein, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared in April 2022 that he had “asked the relevant authorities to fully complete the K-IV project by 2024. We cannot compromise on water supply projects”. A year later, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said in June 2023, “I will take a personal interest in the development of the city.” Earlier, in April 2019, MQM’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui had said: “We are taking this case to the public … We have had enough.”
If Karachi gets just one year of its due share in provincial ADP (Rs372.7bn), federal PSDP (Rs84.4bn), IDC (Rs200bn) and a share in GST against OZT based on the 2006 formula (Rs222.7bn), the total would come to Rs879.8bn this year. It would mean complete funding for the K-IV water project (Rs73bn), the Karachi Circular Railway (Rs300bn), the two unfunded Blue and Brown BRTs (Rs180bn), sewage treatment plants at all discharge points (Rs270bn), and the complete rehabilitation of all Karachi roads.
If provided and spent honestly every year, these funds can bring Karachi closer to being a livable city in a few years, and Pakistan can regain its growth potential, which has been lost since the seventh NFC.
The nation expects the participants of the 11th NFC to work sincerely to: (i) undo the injustice of the seventh NFC and restore the one-sixth GST share as direct transfers to LGs based on the 2006 formula; (ii) provide safeguards to ensure the equitable distribution of development funds across regions; (iii) make provincial shares conditional on the operationalisation of the PFC; and (iv) provide transparent mechanisms to use IDC for the development of the port city and its freight corridor for future trade expansion.

However, the timely evacuation saved the residents, as none of them was found stranded in the floodwater, it is learnt.
The localities suffered due to flood included Shafiqabad, Farrakhabad and Tallat Park near Shahdara bridge and Theme Park, near Chuhng (Multan Road) and Park View. 



 
“At the moment, the Ravi is full of floodwater having flows of nearly 220,000 cusecs whereas the designed capacity of the river is 250,000 cusecs,” revealed Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
According to him, Lahore witnessed worst-ever floods in 1988 after Ravi received 345,000 cusecs flows - around 100,000 cusecs more than the designed capacity - and caused massive destruction in Shahdara and adjoining localities. 
“After the 1988 floods, the water flows measuring 220,000 in the Ravi at the moment is so far the highest one,” he said, expecting reduction in the flows in coming days if no discharge of water from India up to downstream is done.

Human loss averted due to timely evacuation

Talking about the residents’ evacuation from the aforementioned localities, he said at present none of the families are present there as all have been evacuated on time. Some voluntarily left the area and temporarily shifted to their relatives in various parts of the city. 
“Some preferred to shift to the relief camps set up by the administration in various schools. Meal is being served to them three times. Mattresses, pillows etc have also been provided to the affected people present in the camps,” he said, adding that most families have shifted their household goods to the first floor of their houses in a bid to save them from floodwater. 



 
DC Mr Raza said the animals owned by the residents have also been shifted to safe places.
To a question, he said there is no danger to Park View Housing Society, as the developers have built a major embankment to save its one block situated near the river. “The developers have carried out round-the-clock work and built a huge embankment there. Now there is no danger at all. Moreover, evacuation of the residents has already been done,” he said, adding that Rescue 1122 and other relief services have been made available to deal with any flood-related emergency.

On the other hand, some residents of Park View scheme claimed that water flowed into two tail-end uninhabited blocks on Wednesday night.
In a late night (Thursday) development, the water entered some more blocks. However, the people left and locked their houses to shift to their relatives or the relief camps. “The floodwater has left us with no option but to leave this area,” said a resident while talking to Dawn on phone.
The district administration also stationed various officials at the society to monitor and deal with the flood situation in association with various departments concerned.
In Theme Park, the people panicked following announcements from the government to leave the area prior to arrival of the floodwater. “The floodwater entered several houses, including ours. Thanks God, all remained safe as we left the area well on time,” said Jannat Bibi, a resident of Theme Park. “At present we are living in a house at Samsani village, Johar town owned by our relative,” she added.

I asked the young man what he wanted to do with his life, what his likes, dislikes and passions were. Before the young man could answer, his mother said that they just wanted a good education for the son. I asked what ‘good education’ meant to them. The mother said an education that gives the young man a good job.
It was not the time to get into a discussion on what ‘good education’ could mean, other than as a way of getting a good job, though this is definitely an important part of a good education. So we stayed with what could lead to a good job. And then the mother said she believed that her son should do something in computers. I asked the young man if he was interested in computers. He shrugged his shoulders and did not seem too enthusiastic about it, but parroted the idea that computer science was where the jobs of the future lay.
He had little idea what computer science was all about and what sort of career one could take up after studying some area in computer science and IT. I could not help him much. Yes, computers are very important for all workplaces and will be even more so over the coming years. But which knowledge and skills will survive AI, which sub-fields will die (some people say programming is already dead) and which new fields and sub-fields will emerge? It is hard to say right now. Or, at least, I did not have the expertise to guide the young man on this.

Very few schools have academic counsellors and academic counselling offices.

What was also interesting was that the young man appeared to be more interested in business studies and a career in marketing, but the lure of computer science and his mother’s strong perceptions were making him opt for computer science.
It is admission season and many young people completing their A-levels, IB and Intermediate examinations are selecting universities, degrees and majors. But, based on the discussions with 30 or 40 young people and/or their parents whom I met in the last three months, there seems to be a real lack of information and guidance available to young people to make informed career choices.
Computer science is all the rage. And maybe it makes sense, given the hype and apparent demand. But what is good for some might not be good for all. If a child does not want to study computer science, and is not excited by the prospect of studying math, logic, engineering and, later, advanced courses in related areas, forcing him or her to go in this direction will be of no service to either the student or the subject. It is true for any area of study where perceived demand drives career choices.
The apparent demand for computer science and data analytics has skewed university offerings as well. Where computer science and related departments see an increase in applications and are expanding to accommodate demand to the extent possible, many subjects and areas are witnessing a drop in applications and enrolments.
Universities are responding by starting all sorts of in-demand programmes to cater to the shift. In one university, there was no demand for a physics programme; the university rebranded the programme as ‘physics and robotics’, or something similar, and students are now opting for it.
But what are they hoping to achieve since the faculty is the same? When it is actually a watered-down version of physics and robotics? This will have a medium- to long-term impact on students, university structures, programmes and the quality of education. Few universities seem to be taking that into account.
There are significant issues that young people should think through. What career do they want? Is a Bachelor’s programme what they need for that? What should the degree be in? What university and programme is best suited to their needs? They should definitely focus on careers and their future, but should also have a deeper and broader look at issues.
One might be spending 40-50 years in a specific area. It should be something you want to do. If you have to force yourself to come to work every day, 40-50 years can be a long time and can lead to a lot of frustration.
But the question is, given that very few schools have academic counsellors and academic counselling offices, how can young people get advice? Going to private companies and private counsellors is expensive, and they are not widely available beyond three or four of the larger cities. Besides, some are also not really suited to be counsellors. There seems to be a significant gap in the market.
Life was easier some years ago. Young people wanting to pursue a career had the option of medicine or engineering at the top. Other options were explored if a student could not opt for these areas. Management studies started changing things three decades ago. For the last couple of decades, computer science has seen a lot of demand and expansion.
Careers and jobs are more flexible and mobile now. Economies are changing fast. People no longer see jobs as a 30- to 40-year commitment. They change employers and jobs much more frequently. In most industries, jobs have also become less permanent. Manufacturing, in many countries, has stopped expanding. The expansion of the services sector has contributed to and accelerated the process.
Today’s youngsters, who are thinking of higher education and careers now or will be doing so in the next few years, need to know much more about possibilities, opportunities and threats than previously. But where educational opportunities and options have increased, we have not seen a commensurate expansion in counselling services.
Too many of our youth make important decisions about higher education and careers under severe information asymmetry and uncertainty. Universities and higher education regulators need to remedy the situation.

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, whose constituency, Narowal, which borders India and has been flooded, said on Wednesday that India was playing politics with water. Referring to the Indus Waters Treaty, which India has held ‘in abeyance’ following the Pahalgam episode in April, Mr Iqbal said that New Delhi did not share timely information regarding the floodwaters headed for Pakistan.
While India did send a ‘high flood’ warning, this was a general statement delivered through its high commission in Islamabad, and not via the Permanent Indus Commission as mandated by the IWT.
There is mounting evidence that India is indeed politicising the water issue. This includes cutting flows, as it did in the Chenab earlier this year, causing shortages and unleashing huge volumes of water across the border, with little warning and scant details.
Observers add that India’s warnings were little more than theatre to show the international community that despite tensions with Pakistan, it sent advance notice out of ‘humanitarian concerns’.
If India was really motivated by empathy, it would immediately restore the IWT so that timely and precise data could be shared with Pakistan, and flood-related devastation be minimised. As the upper riparian, India has released water in past years, but after proper coordination with Pakistan.
 
 

Under the IWT, both states had shared precise information and minute details about river flows. This allowed the administration to better prepare for the incoming deluge. In the current circumstances, the details shared by New Delhi were overly vague, lacking the technical specifics that were exchanged when the IWT was still being honoured.
The result is that along with the natural intensity of the floods, human malfeasance from the Indian side has compounded the disaster for Pakistan. Sharing of data related to the floodwaters and river flows must be a structured process guided by mutually agreed SOPs.
Guesswork and general warnings cannot replace the specifics. Legally and morally, Pakistan stands on higher ground, as neutral arbiters, such as the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, have ruled that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.
Whether it is holding back flows, or unleashing floodwater, cooperation on the question of transboundary rivers is essential, and India should not politicise this key issue. On its part, Pakistan should continue its diplomatic efforts bilaterally with India and at international forums to restore the treaty. Meanwhile, we need to improve our flood forecasting methods and preparedness to deal with the waters gushing in from across the border, in case India insists on obduracy.

The transfer comes weeks after Justice Ejaz Ishaq issued sweeping contempt of court notices to the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and his entire cabinet for alleged non-compliance with orders in the case.
On July 22, the judge issued the notices; however, that particular proceeding became questionable, as Justice Ejaz Ishaq was not inc­l­u­ded in the Roster of Sitting appr­o­v­­ed by Chief Justice Sardar Moha­m­mad Sarfraz Dogar, since he was on a five-week leave effective from July 20.
Consequently, on July 24, the high court’s registrar put the processing of the contempt notices on hold while staff sought to determine whether they had been issued within jurisdiction.

Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had previously tried to hold PM, his cabinet ‘in contempt’

Meanwhile, under the new roster, Justice Ejaz Ishaq has been placed on a special division bench with Justice Babar Sattar to hear tax references and related commercial matters, a posting that prevents members from sitting as single-judge courts.
 
 

As a result, petitions previously before him, including Dr Fowzia Siddiqui’s, have been transferred to other available judges.
The transfer may come as a sigh of relief for Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif and his cabinet, who might have faced contempt proceedings under the previous judge.
 
 

The judicial reshuffle is part of a broader effort to create specialised benches.
On Aug 13, the IHC administration constituted four such benches for financial and commercial matters and a bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan has been assigned to decide the “Commercial Litigation Corridor” related cases only.
A notification said their bench will adjudicate references filed under the Income Tax Ordinance, Sales Tax Act, Federal Excise Tax Act and Customs Act.
A specialised company bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, and Jus­tice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will take up matters under Section 5(4) of the Companies Act, 2017, as well as cases under Section 8(B) of the Corporate Restructuring Compa­nies (Amendment) Act, 2021 and the SECP Act, 1997.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir has been designated as a single-judge bench to hear cases relating to educational institutions, including medical colleges.
In addition, Justice Tariq Meh­m­ood Jehangiri and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will hear cases under the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, exercising the court’s original civil jurisdiction, as well as civil suits under the Privatisation Commis­sion (Amendment) Act, 2020.
Dr Fowzia’s petition, which has been pending in the IHC since 2015, seeks to compel the government of Pakistan to formally support her sister Dr Aafia, who has been imprisoned in the US since 2008 on terrorism charges.

A man who was trying to move his family to a safer place drowned in the flood. Muhammad Ramzan, a resident of Hajiwala, was taking his family out of the floodwater when he drowned in the fast-moving floodwater. Locals pulled out the dead body from the floodwater. Rescue 1122 confirmed his death.
The flood of rainwater drain Dek entered Narowal city and it submerged houses with two to three foot floodwater. The areas which have seen flooding include Abbas Nagar, Kakar Colony, Satellite Town, Railway Colony, Siddiqui Colony, Kache Kothi, Ganj Hussainabad, Girls College Road, Makki Masjid Road, Eidgah Road. Villages in the path of the floodwater are also flooded. Teams from other districts have also reached Narowal to carry out rescue operations.
 
 

According to the irrigation department, the flow of water in the Ravi River and some other rainwater drains is decreasing. The water level in the Ravi has reduced from 250,000 cusecs to 113,200 cusecs. Despite the increase in water level in the river, the floodwater flowing from the Ravi is moving rapidly towards the village of Baddomalhi.

Man drowns evacuating family; Ravi recedes but Dek causing more flood in Narowal city

There is low-level flooding in the rainwater Dek, Bryan and Basantar. Two days ago, the dam of Dek broke from the village Lahri and Skroor in tehsil Zafarwal. The floodwater flowing from the Dek entered Narowal city. While the water is receding in the river and drains, the floodwater entering Narowal city is increasing. The railway track has been submerged as well. A three-foot floodwater is passing through the Narowal-Sialkot railway crossing. The track of the Narowal Railway Station is flooded.
 
 

The Shakargarh Road from Kakeki Mor to Manzoorpura is 12 feet above the ground. Dozens of flood victims have set up their own temporary camps on the road with their families and animals.
Flood victims, Muhammad Amin and Abdul Razaq, told Dawn that they had been spending nights in the open for the past three days. They complained that their families and animals were trapped in the flood but the administration did not help them. They had no information about the flood relief camps set up by the district government.
“The administration officers pass by Narowal-Shakargarh Road every day in their heavy vehicles but they never stop by or tell us to go to the flood relief camp.”
The flood victims said that there was no fodder for their animals and their cows, buffaloes and goats were hungry for the last three days.
Muhammad Aslam and Kashif Mahmood Siddiqui said they had gone to the flood relief camp established by the district administration Narowal as well. “Though there was medicine for humans and animals, there were no arrangements for food, clean drinking water and accommodation,” they said.
The flood victims demanded Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz take strict notice of the situation.
The district administration claims to have set up 38 relief camps across the district for flood victims. District Emergency Officer Muhammad Aurangzeb told Dawn that 2,311 people, including children, women and men, have been rescued from flood so far. He said 16 teams of rescuers were continuously conducting rescue operations in different areas.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told Dawn that 50 to 75pc of the population of Narowal district had been affected due to the flood. He said 35 water boats were rescuing the flood victims and shifting them to safer places.
“The food packages received from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) are being distributed. The district administration is ensuring the provision of basic facilities to the flood victims at the flood relief camps, claimed the DC.

But while party MNAs are quitting parliamentary panels, none of their senators or MPAs in Punjab have done so.
The party’s chief whip Malik Aamir Dogar told Dawn resignations had been submitted to the NA Secretariat by 5pm on Thursday.
Since not all their legislators were in town at the moment, he said the remaining lawmakers would tender their resignations when they returned to the capital.
When asked whether senators or members of the Punjab Assembly would follow suit, Mr Dogar said the party had not taken any decision with regard to those two legislative bodies.
In a post on X, Mr Dogar shared his own resignation letter, saying that he was quitting the NA standing committees on Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Energy (Power Division), Rules of Procedure and Privileges, as well as the Public Accounts Committee.
 






However, when approached for confirmation, the NA Secretariat said that it had received resignations from 20 lawmakers in all.
On Thursday, those who submitted their resignations included interim party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Amjad Ali Khan, Sahibzada Sibghatullah, Mahboob Shah, Junaid Akbar Khan, Shahzada Gustasap, Ali Jadoon, Mujahid Ali, Malik Anwar Taj, Fazal Muhammad Khan, Sajid Khan, Arbab Amir Ayub, Asif Khan, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, Arshad Sahi, Shabir Ali Qureshi, Awais Jhakkar and Malik Aamir Dogar.
A day earlier, NA DG (Media) Zafar Sultan had told Dawn.com that Ali Asghar Khan and Faisal Amin had sent their resignations as standing committee members to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
“I resigned from the committees based on the instructions of the PTI founder and the political committee,” Barrister Gohar told Dawn.com on Thursday. “I submitted my resignation to the speaker’s office and resigned |from the committees on law and justice, human rights, IT and the House Business Advisory Committee.”

In light of these reservations, Chief Justice Yayha Afridi had also constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to make recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to the provisions of these guidelines. The committee comprised Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi.
The CJP had also visited the bar room inside the Supreme Court building a few days ago, a source told Dawn. Justice Afridi had assured the bar leaders that their concerns would be allayed soon.
The new rules were formulated to enhance modernisation, ensure procedural clarity, and integrate technology into the justice system. While constituting the committee, the apex court had invited suggestions and feedback from judges, the bar, litigants, and the general public. The written suggestions had been furnished before the committee by the bar leaders.

CJP assures of allaying concerns after raising of court fees, other proposed measures drew flak from lawyers’ bodies

The Supreme Court believed that the new rules were conceived as a living document responsive to the needs of the bench, the bar, and the litigants in light of the emerging legal and technological developments.
The rules, which also raised the court fee, had invited criticism from the Supreme Court Bar Association President Mian M Rauf Atta, who had urged the apex court to withdraw the recent increase in the court filing fee to restore public confidence and uphold the constitutional promise of speedy, inexpensive, and unobstructed justice. According to him, the new rules were introduced without prior and meaningful consultation with the premier legal body.
Likewise, the Executive Committee of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) in its meeting of Aug 23 had disapproved the recent amendments, replacing the Supreme Court Rules 1980 with the Supreme Court Rules 2025.
Presided over by its chairman Yasin Azad, the executive committee had also regretted that the Supreme Court did not consult or take on board the council regarding the increase in court fees and demanded immediate withdrawal of the said amendment.
Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new rules replaced the outdated provisions and consist of seven parts, 38 orders, and six schedules, with approximately 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the Schedules), 60 new provisions added, and five outdated provisions deleted.
The key highlights of the rules included digital transition and technological criteria suggesting all petitions and paper books be filed electronically; digital issuance of notices, orders, and certified copies while permitting pleadings and hearings through video-link; affidavits may be authenticated by apostille; parties and advocates must provide updated phone numbers, email addresses, and digital app details; and that judicial documents sent via post will not be entertained.

The court ruling paved the way for smooth selling of the national flag carrier.
The petition, filed by Advocate Sardar Amber Maqsood, alleged that the Privatisation Commission had failed to issue proper notices of intent under Section 23 and did not conduct a lawful valuation of PIACL’s assets under Sec­tion 24 of the Ordinance.
The petitioner also sought suspension of the process until the establishment of a Privatisation Appellate Tribunal.
Justice Jawad Hassan, who authored the detailed judgement, observed that the Privatisation Comm­ission had advertised its intent to privatise PIACL in leading international and national newspapers, including Financial Times, China Daily, The Wall Street Journal, Dawn, and Daily Jang.
The LHC also noted that Ernst & Young Consulting LLC, Dubai, was appointed as the financial adviser to conduct independent valuation of PIA’s local and international assets in accordance with law.
The court dismissed the petition, holding that the process of privatisation met the requirements of Sections 23 and 24 of the Ordinance; the petitioner failed to provide credible material or documents to substantiate allegations of illegality; judicial review cannot be invoked to obstruct economic policy decisions of the executive, unless clear violations of law or fundamental rights are established.
On the broader question of judicial intervention in economic policy, the court stressed the need for judicial restraint, citing Supreme Court precedents which caution against interference in matters of privatisation and foreign investment.
 
 

Justice Hassan warned that frivolous petitions could derail sensitive economic reforms and undermine investor confidence.
The judgement also recorded that the bidding process for PIACL had already been cancelled, rendering the petition infructuous. Nonetheless, the court clarified that even if proceedings had continued, the Privatisation Commission’s process was legally sound and transparent.
On the petitioner’s application to summon evaluation records, the court declined, citing the Privatisation Commission (Confidentiality and Secrecy of Documents) Regulations, 2003, which classify valuation reports and due diligence documents as confidential.
Concluding the 37-page judgment, the court reaffirmed that privatisation is part of the federal government’s constitutional mandate under Article 173, aimed at reducing the fiscal burden of loss-making state-owned enterprises.
The court cautioned litigants against misusing public interest litigation to create hurdles in economic policy matters.

The Met Office said strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal were likely to enter the upper parts of the country from August 29, while a westerly wave was also expected to approach the upper and central parts from August 30.
These conditions will bring widespread rain, “at times very heavy” with thunder and lightning in Kashmir’s Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawa­lakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, and Mirpur areas from August 29 to September 2. The Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, and Shigar districts will witness rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) from August 30 to September 1 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls, at times very heavy) is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Koh­istan, Shangla, Battagram, Mans­ehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan from August 29 to September 1.
Punjab, which is already reeling under the intensity of exceptionally high floods, is also expecting “heavy falls, at times very heavy” in almost all districts.
Rain is expected in Islamabad/Rawa­lpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Att­ock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bah­a­­uddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Haf­izabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad, and Sahiwal from August 29 to Sep­t­ember 2 with occasional gaps.
 
 

“Rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in D.G. Khan, Bhakkar, Lay­yah, Multan, Bahawalpur, Baha­w­a­lnagar, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan from August 29 (night) to Se­­­p­­t­ember 2,” the statement added.
In Sindh, rain is expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Sukkur, Lar­kana, Jacobabad, Dadu, and Umer Kot on August 30-31 with occasio­nal gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thunder­shower (with isolated hea­­­­­v­­y fa­­lls) is expected in Barkhan, Mus­­­akhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Ka­­­lat, and Khuzdar from August 30 to September 1 with occasional gaps.
The Meteorological Office war­ned that the downpour may generate flash floods in Kashmir and hilly areas of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the spell. Landslides/mudslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakh­tunk­hwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree, Ga­­li­­yat, and Kashmir during the forecast period, it warned.

There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incident, either.
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
Quoting Afghan authorities, the Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that three children were killed and several others wounded when ‘drones’ hit the home of one Haji Naeem Khan in Khost’s Spera district, near the border with North Waziristan.
AFP photographs from Spera showed people standing outside a badly damaged home in the Lahori Village.
Meanwhile, Afghan officials claimed that four sons and two wives of a man named Shahsawar were among those injured when his house was destroyed in Nangarhar’s Shinwar district.
The Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement that it strongly condemns the violation of Afghanistan’s airspace, and that the bombing of civilians such irresponsible actions will inevitably have consequences.
It said that a protest note was formally handed to Pakistan’s ambassador, Ubaid-ur-Rehman Nizam­ani, during a meeting in Kabul on Thursday.
Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistan jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting members of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­is­tan (TTP).
At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”.
A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled. In April of this year, ISPR claimed killing at least 54 terrorists who were trying to cross into North Waziristan.
 
 

Then, earlier this month, at least 50 attackers were killed trying to cross from Afghanistan into Balo­chistan’s Zhob district.
Recent negotiations bet­ween the TTP and tribesmen in border districts have also laid bare the reality of their chain of comm­and, as the militants rep­e­a­tedly sought time to consu­lt their leaders in Afgha­n­istan.

MANDI BAHAUDDIN: Residents wade through a flooded road in Qadirabad village near the River Chenab.—Reuters

LAHORE: The Punjab government has launched one of its largest evacuation operations in recent years, as floodwaters affected over 1.46 million people across the province, with the Chenab River expected to swell to dangerous levels at Head Trimmu.
Extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers have also resulted in the loss of 17 lives.
The province is battling its worst flooding in four decades, which has caused havoc in hundreds of villages and submerged vital grain crops.
Torrential monsoon rain and India’s release of excess water from its dams swelled the three rivers that flow into the province, forcing authorities to breach riverbanks in some places and causing flooding in more than 1,400 villages.
Authorities warned that between 700,000 and 800,000 cusecs of water could pass through the Chenab River system in the next 48 hours, threatening widespread devastation.
The relocation effort covers several districts and hundreds of towns, including Jhang, Shorkot, Khanewal, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Shujaabad, Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur.
Water levels
As of 12am on Friday, Trimmu near Jhang was in normal flow at 117,534 cubic feet per second (cusecs), but was showing a rising trend, according to the Flood Forecasting Division.
The division reported falling trends upstream. At Marala Headworks near Sialkot, the flow has dropped to 106,496 cusecs (low flood), while both Khanki and Qadirabad headworks stand at 305,436 cusecs.
While the Ravi River has stabilised at Jassar near Narowal (95,580 cusecs), Shahdara was in “exceptionally high flood” with a water outflow of 219,770 cusecs, though the trend was steady. The next stop, Head Balloki near Pattoki, was in the “high flood” category at 114,110 cusecs and showing a rising trend.
Further downstream, Head Sidhnai near Abdul Hakeem showed a rising trend, with an inflow of 25,443 cusecs and outflow of 10,093 cusecs.
 
 

On the Sutlej River, Ganda Singh Wala near Kasur was in “exceptionally high flood” at 261,053 cusecs, Sulemanki near Bahawalnagar was in “medium flood” at 113,124 cusecs, and Head Islam was in “low flood” at 52,706 cusecs.
Meanwhile on the Indus River, Tarbela Dam showed a normal flow with an outflow of 155,400 cusecs.
Scale of damage
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,692 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 17 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 265,000 people, of whom 1,372 were living in 355 relief camps and 6,656 were provided with medical help, whereas 90,348 people and 154,980 cattle were transported to safety.
A total of 991 villages were submerged due to flooding in the Chenab River. Some 395 villages were affected by the floods in Sialkot, 127 in Jhang, 124 in Multan, 48 in Chiniot, 66 in Gujrat, 51 in Khanewal, 45 in Hafizabad, 41 in Sargodha, 35 in Mandi Bahauddin, and 19 villages in Wazirabad.
Due to flooding in the Chenab, more than one million people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. Some 73,000 animals have been moved to safe locations, and 72 veterinary camps have been set up in affected districts.
In the Ravi, around 80 villages were submerged, including 75 in Narowal, four in Sheikhupura, and one in Nankana Sahib. Around 11,000 people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. Nearly 4,500 animals have been moved to safe locations. A total of 52 veterinary camps have been set up in affected districts.
As for the Sutlej River, a total of 361 villages were submerged, including 72 in Kasur, 86 in Okara, 24 in Pakpattan, 27 in Multan, 23 in Vehari, 104 in Bahawalnagar and 25 villages in Bahawalpur. Nearly 127,000 people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. A total of 70,000 animals have been moved to safe locations, whereas 90 veterinary camps have been set up.
‘No compensation’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday lauded the exemplary coordination among all stakeholders for averting a major flood disaster in Gujranwala and Wazirabad.
Speaking to the media in Wazirabad, he assured that arrangements were in place for the provision of relief items, including tents, food and medical supplies.
A survey is currently underway to estimate livestock losses, and compensation will be provided to affected individuals. However, he stressed that no compensation would be given for structures built illegally in these high-risk areas.
Meanwhile, flooding also disrupted flight operations at Sialkot International Airport, where services were suspended for 24 hours on Thursday.

The airport spokesperson confirmed that the runway and terminal were safe, with drainage work underway.
An official told Dawn that the last flight from Sialkot airport — a Dubai-bound Flydubai — departed on Thursday morning.
PM, CM visit affected areas
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, conducted an aerial survey of affected areas on Thursday. NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider briefed the premier on the overall situation.
During her visit to the Ravi, CM Maryam expressed regret that the crisis had been aggravated by the opening of spillways by India but noted that the province’s early warning system was functioning effectively, allowing the timely evacuation of residents.
International support
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye phoned PM Shehbaz to express solidarity and offer assistance in rescue and relief efforts.
“Turkiye stands ready to help in any way possible, including during the rescue and relief efforts,” President Erdogan said, according to the PM Office.
PM Shehbaz thanked him for the support, calling it reflective of the “deep-rooted fraternal ties” between the two nations.

The second seed has looked like a top contender after picking up her sixth major at Wimbledon and clinching the Cincinnati tune-up tournament and she cleaned up some mid-match errors to keep her campaign on track.
She will play 29th seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round.
Swiatek was in control as she broke in the second game when her opponent hit the ball long and she saved a break point in the third game with an unreturnable serve.
The Pole broke her opponent from the baseline again in the sixth game, as Lamens was unable to fire off a single winner in the first set.
It looked as though it would be a similar story when Lamens went down an early break in the second set, but the Dutchwoman showed signs of life when she hit a backhand winner that just hit the baseline to level it in the fourth game.
Swiatek retaliated in the seventh game, sending over a lethal backhand to take the advantage back, only to see her lead evaporate again with a double fault in the eighth and she sent a backhand into the net on set point.
Down four games to one in the third set, Lamens narrowed the lead when she survived a 12-shot rally on break point in the sixth game, but it was too little too late as Swiatek cruised through her final two service games.</p><small>2025-08-28 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2823054539038e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937957/iran-vows-response-to-unjustified-and-illegal-sanctions-snapback-by-european-powers' target='_blank'><strong>Iran vows response to ‘unjustified and illegal’ sanctions snapback by European powers</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Thursday that Tehran would respond to a decision by France, Britain and Germany to trigger a mechanism reimposing UN sanctions under a moribund 2015 nuclear deal.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will respond appropriately to this illegal and unjustified action by the three European countries, in order to protect and guarantee its national rights and interests,” Araghchi told his French, British and German counterparts in a phone call, according to a statement from his ministry.
He called on the three countries to “appropriately correct this wrong decision in the coming days”.
While Araghchi did not specify what retaliatory measures Iran might take, Tehran has previously warned that such a move could lead to the exclusion of the European powers from any future negotiations on Iran’s nuclear
programme.
In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry said: “This decision by the three European countries will seriously undermine the ongoing process of interaction and cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),” the foreign ministry said in a statement, calling the move a “provocative and unnecessary escalation”.
The move by the European trio — known as the E3 — took place just days after Iranian and European diplomats held talks in Geneva, the second since Israel’s attack on Iran that started a 12-day war in June.
The E3 had been threatening in recent weeks to activate the so-called “snapback” mechanism, citing Iran’s continued non-compliance with its commitments under the 2015 nuclear agreement.
The three powers launched a 30-day process to reimpose sanctions, fearing they would otherwise lose the prerogative in mid-October to restore them.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the decision did not signal the end of diplomacy, while his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, urged Iran to now fully cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog agency and commit to direct talks with the United States over the next month.
That deal was torpedoed in 2018 when Donald Trump, during his first term as president, unilaterally withdrew the United States and slapped crippling sanctions on Iran.
Tehran and Washington had begun nuclear talks in April with the aim of reaching another deal, but these negotiations were derailed by the war with Israel, during which the United States also struck Iranian nuclear sites.</p><small>2025-08-28 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28152532faa2ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937892/imrans-nephew-shershah-sent-to-lahore-jail-on-judicial-remand-as-police-denied-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s nephew Shershah sent to Lahore jail on judicial remand as police denied custody</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Thursday sent PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah Khan to jail on judicial remand in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.

Lahore police presented Shershah before the court of ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill today upon the completion of his five-day physical remand.
Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and Barrister Taimur Malik appeared as Shershah’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was the prosecutor.
Aleema, along with her sisters Uzma Khan and Noreen, appeared in the court, while Shershah was presented amid tight security.
 
 

The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill, rejecting the police request, sent Shershah on judicial remand.
Meanwhile, Aleema filed a bail plea before the ATC for Shershah through Advocate Umer.
“The suspect has been arrested on political motives,” the plea said, contending there was no evidence against Shershah. It requested the court to order the suspect’s release on bail.
According to today’s court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Shershah’s photogrammetry test was conducted, and a “wooden danda (baton)” was recovered from his possession. “Sufficient investigation stands concluded,” it said.
Judge Gill noted: “So far as investigation into the extent of social media accounts is concerned, in the present era of technology as well as digital devices, social media accounts of each and every person could be easily traced and recovered without the support of the accused.
“This court is of the further view that there is no sufficient ground available for further physical remand,” he added.
The judge ordered that Shershah be produced before the court on September 11 and directed the investigation officer to submit the charge sheet by then.
At the outset of the hearing, state prosecutor Sipra informed the judge that a baton was recovered from Shershah. However, he added, Shershah’s mobile, tear gas mask and social media accounts were yet to be recovered.
At this point, Advocate Umer asserted that his client was falsely accused and “his arrest in the case was illegal”. “The court may reject the police’s request for physical remand,” he said.
“After 27 months, Shershah was not served even a single notice to record his statement,” Umer added. He noted that a court had previously discharged PTI senior leader Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case of a similar nature.
“We provided a copy of the same court in which, on similar facts, Dr Yasmin Rashid was discharged from this case,” Barrister Malik said on X.
 






Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-28 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28204902782bf11.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937945/canada-india-appoint-new-envoys-to-each-others-countries-in-sign-of-improving-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Canada, India appoint new envoys to each other’s countries in sign of improving ties</strong></a><br><p>Canada and India announced new high commissioners to each other’s countries on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving ties frayed by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegation that India was linked to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil.
India’s previous high commissioner left Canada in October. Ottawa said he was among six diplomats who were expelled after they were linked to the murder of separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, while India said it had withdrawn the envoy.
India also said that same day that it had ordered the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the then-acting high commissioner.
Trudeau’s successor, Mark Carney, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to reinstate senior diplomats when they held their first bilateral meeting in Canada in June.
Canada’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday that veteran diplomat Christopher Cooter would take up the post, which had been vacant since the previous incumbent left last year.
“The appointment of a new high commissioner reflects Canada’s step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India,” Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in a statement.
 






India’s foreign ministry said its new high commissioner, Dinesh K Patnaik, was “expected to take up the assignment shortly”.
Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India in 2020, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in June 2023.
Trudeau in September of that year said Canada was pursuing “credible allegations” linking Indian government agents to his murder, but India dismissed the claims and accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
Canada has the largest population of Sikhs outside India’s Punjab.
India is Canada’s top source of temporary foreign workers and international students, as well as an important market for pulses such as lentils and yellow peas.
Canadian Prime Minister Carney has stressed the importance of diversifying trade away from the United States.
The appointment of a new high commissioner came a day after United States President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50 per cent took effect, delivering a serious blow to ties.</p><small>2025-08-28 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28175715c7d4d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937925/pti-chairman-barrister-gohar-resigns-from-4-na-standing-committees' target='_blank'><strong>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar resigns from 4 NA standing committees</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Thursday resigned from four standing committees in the National Assembly (NA), he confirmed in comments to Dawn.com.
PTI lawmakers have begun resigning from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the NA after instructions from party founder Imran Khan, after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots against Imran’s arrest.
“I resigned from the committees based on the instructions of the PTI founder and the political committee,” Gohar said over the phone. “I submitted my resignation to the speaker’s office and resigned from the committees on law and justice, human rights, IT and the House Business Advisory Committee.”
PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar also announced his resignation from NA standing committees in a post on X, where he wrote that he submitted the resignations upon the instructions of the party founder and ex-premier.
“I am a true soldier of Imran Khan, and no position holds more meaning than my leader,” he wrote. “The sole purpose of my politics is Imran Khan’s mission, Pakistan’s true independence and service to the people.”
He enclosed a photo of his resignation letter with the X post, which outlined that he resigned from the NA standing committees on religious affairs and interfaith harmony, the Public Accounts Committee, energy (Power Division) and the committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges.
 






Meanwhile, NA Director General (Media) Zafar Sultan Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that 18 PTI members, including Gohar, resigned from standing committees.
“Barrister Gohar submitted the resignations of 18 PTI members, including himself, from standing committees,” he said in a voice note, adding that PTI members are part of 34 standing committees in the House.
The list of resigning PTI members, provided by DG Sultan, is as follows:

Amjad Ali Khan
Sahibzada Sibghatullah
Mahboob Shah
Junaid Akbar
Gohar Ali Khan
Shahzada Muhammad Gustasap Khan
Ali Jadoon
Mujahid Ali
Malik Anwar Taj
Fazal Muhammad Khan
Sajid Khan
Arbab Amir Ayub
Asif Khan
Sheikh Waqas Akram
Arshad Sahi
Malik Aamir Dogar
Shabir Ali Qureshi
Awais Jhakkar

Yesterday, DG Sultan told Dawn.com that Ali Asghar Khan and Faisal Amin had sent their resignations as standing committee members to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
A statement from Dogar also said: “PTI members of the National Assembly have started acting on the instructions of founding chairman Imran Khan. PTI members of standing committees have started sending their resignations. Many members have submitted their resignations to the National Assembly Secretariat.”
However, a senior official in the secretariat, on condition of anonymity, said that the speaker had yet to receive any of the resignation letters.
The resignation announcement took place following a meeting of PTI’s political committee that ended at 3:30am on Wednesday, according to PTI MNA Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel.</p><small>2025-08-28 13:30</small></div><hr>
