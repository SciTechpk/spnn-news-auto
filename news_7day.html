<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051349006234a7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/na-speaker-says-opposition-has-not-made-formal-contact-for-initiating-talks' target='_blank'><strong>NA speaker says opposition has not made formal contact for initiating talks</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said on Monday that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.
He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.
“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.
Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.
On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.







“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.
He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.

 

However, the PTI later said that it would not engage in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had stated that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
Bangladesh visit
The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the funeral of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had shaken hands during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.
“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.
He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.
Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.
He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.
He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.
PTI whip meets NA speaker, demands Achakzai’s appointment
Later in the day, the opposition’s chief whip in the NA, Amir Dogar, in a meeting with Sadiq, once again demanded the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader.
He also submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against PTI leader Omar Ayub to him.
Since Ayub’s disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant.
According to a press statement issued by the NA Secretariat today, the two “exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader”.







During the meeting, Dogar submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against the disqualified opposition leader Ayub, the statement said.
Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai should be appointed as the opposition leader.
In August last year, the incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had nominated Achakzai for the post of opposition leader.
In response to Dogar’s request, the NA speaker said that everything “will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”, adding that he would apprise the House of the matter in the next session.
He added that “a fresh process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated.
Sadiq maintained that “the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader are clear”.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051456086d9345a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965258/sindh-ctd-says-major-terrorist-plot-in-karachi-foiled-2000kg-of-explosive-material-seized' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CTD says major terrorist plot in Karachi foiled; 2,000kg of explosive material seized</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday that a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi.
Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city.
Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans.
He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region.
Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material.
He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid.
“We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture.
“The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.
He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material.
He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested.
Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.
The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified.
“All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest.
He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.
He said that the explosive material seized was “a mix”, saying that some of it was an amalgam of commercial explosives and other items, while some of it was smuggled through Balochistan’s mountainous regions.
The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.</p><small>2026-01-05 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051437581930b45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259/bangladesh-orders-indefinite-ban-on-ipl-telecast-after-mustafizur-rahman-row' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh orders indefinite ban on IPL telecast after Mustafizur Rahman row</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh government on Monday ordered an indefinite ban on the telecast and promotion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) following the controversy surrounding the removal of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad, The Daily Star reported.
The development comes after KKR said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said after an emergency meeting that it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.
A statement from the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it had “noted that no reason was communicated for the decision behind Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion [from the IPL]” and that the development had “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”, Daily Star reported.
“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the statement said, adding that the decision had been taken “in public interest”.
It was signed by the ministry’s assistant secretary Firoz Khan.
“There is no logical reason for this decision of the Indian Cricket Board and such a decision has distressed, shocked and angered the people of Bangladesh,” the government statement further said, according to India Today.
“A request has been made to stop the promotion/broadcast of all games and events of the Indian Premier League (IPL) until further orders,” the statement added. TV channels and streaming platforms have broadcast the IPL in Bangladesh since its inception in 2008, according to ESPN Cricinfo.
This is also the first time that the Bangladesh government has banned the telecast of an international cricket tournament, anywhere in the world.
BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“
Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.
Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh
The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.
Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.
On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.
The ICC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p><small>2026-01-05 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051349218fbd379.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965255/university-of-lahore-student-injured-after-jumping-from-varsitys-second-floor-police' target='_blank'><strong>University of Lahore student injured after jumping from varsity’s second floor: police</strong></a><br><p>A first-semester pharmacy student sustained injuries after she jumped from the second floor at the University of Lahore on Monday, police said.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran told Dawn that the student was originally from Narowal, adding that her parents had been asked to come to Lahore.
“She jumped from the second floor of the pharmacy department,” the DIG said, adding that for now, the incident appeared to be “a suicide attempt”.
However, he continued, police had yet to ascertain the reason behind the incident.
The official further stated that the student’s legs had been fractured, and she had been hospitalised. “Her condition is serious, but there is no severe head injury,” DIG Kamran added.
He said that according to the initial information collected thus far, it was discovered that the student was talking to someone on the phone around half an hour before the incident, but no further details were available yet.
“She jumped during the call,” he said.
The DIG said police had taken the girl’s mobile phone into custody, which was locked. “We are waiting for her medical treatment to end, following which we will ask her for her password so that the phone can be checked. Otherwise, we will get an analysis conducted,” he added.
The official said an investigation of the incident was under way and nothing could be said for certain at this point.
A first information report of the incident has not been filed so far.
DIG Kamran said it was up to the girl’s parents whether they wanted to file a complaint.
Meanwhile, the University of Lahore decided to suspend its on-campus classes.
A notice issued by the office of the varsity’s registrar on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “It is hereby notified for the information of all concerned that, in order to secure the campus buildings and ensure the safety and well-being of students, all on-campus teaching activities of the University of Lahore shall remain suspended.
“Accordingly, all classes scheduled today are called off and all academic activities will be shifted to online mode from Tuesday, January 6, 2025 until further orders,“ it added.
DIG Kamran told Dawn that police had spoken with the university’s administration, which had decided to suspend on-campus classes.
He said the administration had conveyed to the police that they were also considering installing fences on every floor or deploying staff to ensure safety and prevent the occurrence of such incidents.
Today’s incident comes less than three weeks after a 22-year-old Pharm-D student died after jumping from the fourth floor of the University of Lahore’s building on December 19 last year.
Family and classmates claimed that Awais faced humiliation after low attendance in one subject. They said his entire semester could have been wasted despite the payment of his fee.</p><small>2026-01-05 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05140014cfbaffd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965250/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-calls-on-lawyers-to-stand-up-for-independence-of-judiciary' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi calls on lawyers to stand up for independence of judiciary</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday called on lawyers in Islamabad to stand up for an independent judiciary as he continued his efforts to rally support for the PTI’s street movement.
The KP CM made the remarks while addressing the legal fraternity at an event organised by the Islamabad Bar Association. After completing a three-day visit to Lahore, Afridi has announced Karachi as his next destination.
“If you do not stand up for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law and for an independent judiciary, then future generations will spit on us and you as well,” Afridi said.
He urged them to announce a lawyers’ movement, adding that the youth will support them. “Long live resistance,” the chief minister said.



“You must support the PTI founder [Imran Khan] against oppression and barbarity. Whose conscience is even one per cent alive will stand against the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, as well as unfair trials — whether of journalists or politicians — and will demand the release of all political workers who are wrongfully in jail,” Afridi said.
CM Afridi also stressed that Imran did not seek his release, but rather a fair trial. “A convicted person was received at the airport,” the PTI leader said, apparently referring to ex-premier Nawaz Sharif landing in Islamabad after he returned to Pakistan in October 2023.
During his address, Afridi also praised Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who was among the audience.
“Imaan Mazari has created a new history of resistance. The youth receive encouragement from her,“ Afridi said. He also mentioned that some journalists were recently sentenced after their “trials in absentia”.
“Arshad Sharif had to leave his country to save his life because he was not getting justice and security here, but he was not spared even abroad,” the KP CM said, referring to the journalist being shot dead in Kenya on Oct 23, 2022.
Afridi cautioned the lawyers that while the PTI was facing “oppression and fascism today”, it could be their turn tomorrow. “You will not be able to tolerate what the PTI has,“ he said.
Afridi once again lamented that he was repeatedly being denied a meeting with Imran, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“Three judges [of the IHC] issued orders for [my] meeting with the PTI founder, but the Adiala jail’s superintendent threw that directive in the trash,” the KP CM said.
He said that Imran was “fighting our war in jail”, adding that “those who took cars from the Toshakhana were the rulers and the person who took items legally was in prison“.
“They have incapacitated you all,” the chief minister said.
CM Afridi further said that “people from all schools of thought” in KP believed that a military operation was not the solution to rising militancy in the province.
“But there are still preparations for an operation. This is not a functioning system but hooliganism,” the chief minister said.</p><small>2026-01-05 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05000641ae0deb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965077/we-did-this-incredible-thing-trumps-capture-of-maduro-and-the-complexities-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>’We did this incredible thing’: Trump’s capture of Maduro and the ‘complexities’ of international law</strong></a><br><p>It shouldn’t be shocking and yet it still is. Images of the leader of a sovereign, oil-rich nation humiliated and handcuffed by the world’s superpower using tactics as crude as the resource it seeks to control. We have seen this before, after all.
Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, Congo’s Patrick Lumumba, Iran’s Mohammad Mosaddegh, Chile’s Salvador Allende and Panama’s Manuel Noriega all met the same fate (a full list would take up the entire article). Regime change, rinse, repeat.
‘He effed around and he found out’
By most accounts, Maduro seems to have gotten off lightly. In 2019, US Senator Marco Rubio threatened that the Venezuelan leader would meet the same fate as Qaddafi, tweeting a photo of the bloodied Libyan general before he was reportedly sodomised and killed by US supported rebels. The CIA has long preferred assassination as the policy option for stubborn leaders using underhanded tactics like poisoned cigars, turning lovers into honeypots, planting a Brutus within a Caesar’s inner circle. That is until Trump decided the US no longer needed to operate from the shadows.
In 2017, Trump considered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reportedly saying “let’s f***ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f***ing lot of them.”  And it seems with Maduro, someone did try. A few months after Rubio’s threat, there was an attack against Maduro’s life, which was “the world’s first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone, purchased online and armed by hand with military grade explosives”.
After spending many years trying to illegitimise the Venezuelan leader in order to pave the way for the invasion, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who has the verbal range of a legacy-admitted frat bro at an American university, said that Maduro had his chance but had “effed around and he found out”. He also said, in an effort to appease the Republican MAGA base, that this regime change operation was “America First” and he was right in a way; the biggest winners of the night were Texan oil barons.
‘We’re going to take back the oil’
The plot to overthrow Venezuela started when Hugo Chávez was elected into power. “Washington has never forgiven Chávez for nationalising the oil”, says Paul Craig Roberts, economist and Assistant Treasury Secretary for President Ronald Reagan, “and using the revenues from the oil flows for Venezuela rather than for the profits of American firms”. Chávez, a savvy economist advancing his state’s interests, wanted oil prices as high as they could go and lobbied fellow members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil output to keep prices high. He was charging American corporations a premium for his oil, a super heavy and filthy oil which they covet.
Chavez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, wanted to continue his legacy when he was elected into power in 2013 but his woes began soon into his premiership.
In 2014, the US worked with other oil-producing countries to intentionally depress the price of oil to undermine the economies of oil-dependent Russia and Iran.The biggest casualty of this cabal though was Venezuela whose economy was ‘destroyed’ given oil accounted for 96 per cent of its exports.
Soon after, President Obama imposed sanctions on the country claiming perversely that it posed a national security threat to the US.
Trump levied an even worse financial embargo that cut Venezuela off from almost all borrowing, stole its assets (with the help of European allies) and plunged an already economically distressed country into ruin. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have been killed due to restrictions on food and life-saving medicines with reports from renowned economists indicating that sanctions “fuelled an economic collapse equivalent to three Great Depressions”. All the while, the West collaborated to starve Venezuela and then blamed the country for starving.
However, Maduro clung to power and refused to sell his country to the US. His opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, who the US had touted as his replacement until the invasion, has been very clear that he would sell the country in a handbasket, having declared in the past: “I will open up the Venezuela oil fields to American companies.”
Maduro’s intransigence left Texan energy executives with three options — either import that oil from Canada which would take too long (7-14 days), or the Middle East which would take even longer (43 days), or install a puppet government in Venezuela which would give them cheap oil quickly (4 days).
For the final option, the government would follow a tried and tested two prong approach; illegitimise the government to topple it, and if that doesn’t work, invade.
‘The legal classification … is complex’
The process of illegitimising a government is led by rhetoric paid to a sacred set of rules we call international law. These rules are then set aside immediately once the illegitimising has proved fruitless and invasion is deemed to be required.
Maduro, we heard almost daily from mouthpieces in the West, is in flagrant violation of international human rights standards in his oppressive tactics and corrupt practices. Yet when the US invaded the country and captured its leader to overthrow him, suddenly international law becomes a very complex byzantine system that nobody without a doctorate should attempt to understand.
The lily-livered German Chancellor has said ‘[t]he legal deployment of the US deployment is complex. We will take our time with that.’ The craven Greek prime minister, after deploring Maduro’s violations of international law, says “this is not the time to comment on the legality of recent actions”. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister has pretty much said that if the government is bad enough, a country can be invaded. Apparently non-ironically.
I can quote international law by the yard and it is as clear as it can be. America’s actions are a violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and a clear act of aggression. The US’ own legal actions reflect this.
In the operation to abduct Maduro, the Trump administration has relied on a highly controversial 1989 legal memorandum claiming the President does not need to abide by the UN Charter as a matter of domestic law. That is as clear an admission of a violation as we can get from the US, which often cloaks its actions in the framing of self-defence, as it did with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in 2020.
Moreover, while Maduro is a lawful military target during the conduct of hostilities as commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces; when captured, he becomes a Prisoner of War protected by the Third Geneva Convention.
He can only be tried for war crimes, and not the domestic charges laid against him by a jurisdiction to which he should not be subject. While it seems to be the case that Maduro negotiated this exit himself, unfortunately for the German Chancellor, the international law violated here would be obvious to any first year student at any law school.
‘We can take care of the country’
Since the US has said, as per President Trump, that it will ‘run the country’ for an indefinite period and has also accepted that American boots were on the ground in Venezuela, the US will be an occupying power. The occupation will be governed by international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits changing any laws in the occupied territories ‘unless absolutely prevented’ from doing so.
This provision was left to collect dust in Iraq when the US coalition went so far as to pretty much rewrite the Iraqi constitution.  Paul Bremer, the American leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority, said that “[m]ost Iraqis have no experience of free thought. They vaguely understand the concept of freedom, but still want us to tell them what to do.”
The Venezuelans, it seems, will be suffering the same fate. They will be told what to do while their natural resources are privatised by cowboy moguls, their land is exploited by property tycoons, and their foreign policy decided by pro-Zionist wonks in Washington.
China and Russia will look on with dismay but apathy; if the Americas belong to the US, then Europe can belong to Russia and Asia to China. The Global South will pound their fists but know that it can and will happen again. And Iran will wait with bated breath.

PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
A joint press release issued on Monday said that the agreement marked a major step toward enhancing Pakistan’s national cybersecurity posture through collaboration in threat detection, mitigation, and prevention.
“The partnership between PKCERT and Kaspersky focuses on strengthening the country’s cyber resilience through a series of coordinated efforts. These include extensive training and awareness programs designed to enhance operational readiness across all levels of government, industry, academia, and civil society,” the statement said.
It added that the collaboration also focused on capacity development to cultivate a skilled cybersecurity workforce aligned with both national and international standards.
“Additionally, the two organisations will ensure the timely dissemination of actionable cyber threat intelligence to relevant stakeholders across Pakistan,” it said.
Under the MoU, the statement added, the organisations will cooperate across a wide range of cybersecurity areas, “including legislative and regulatory issues, incident detection and response, prevention and mitigation strategies, cybersecurity education, research and development, and professional exchanges”.
“The two organisations will exchange relevant technical information, threat intelligence, and data feeds related to cyber threats and cyberattacks affecting citizens, businesses, and government institutions in Pakistan,” it said.
According to the press release, the MoU was signed by Dr Haider Abbas, the director general of PKCERT, and Rashed Al Momani, general manager for the Middle East and Pakistan at Kaspersky. It was signed in the presence of Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky and IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja.
“Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in socio-economic development of a country; however, they have also introduced new challenges such as cyber espionage, hacktivism, ransomware, data breaches, identity theft, attacks on critical infrastructure, financial and supply chain disruptions, and disinformation campaigns,“ the statement quoted Abbas as saying.
“Our collaboration with Kaspersky, a global leader with expertise in these domains, represents another important step toward strengthening national cybersecurity,” he added.
“Safeguarding digital development requires robust cybersecurity, founded on deep and continuous partnerships between public authorities and private companies. Kaspersky has a long and fruitful history of working with global and regional organisations such as Interpol and Afripol, as well as local computer emergency response teams around the world,” Al Momani said.
“We highly value this cooperation with PKCERT as an important step in consolidating Pakistan’s secure digital transformation for the entire nation,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-05 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05090626fa59c7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965237/1-killed-8-injured-in-ied-attack-on-vehicle-carrying-cement-workers-in-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 8 injured in IED attack on vehicle carrying cement workers in Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: One person was killed while eight others were injured when a vehicle carrying cement workers was targeted by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
The district police spokesperson, Qudratullah, said that the vehicle, which was carrying cement factory workers, was targeted by Fitna al Khwarij terrorists near Nawar Khel area on Begokhel road.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He said the injured had been taken to the City Hospital. He identified the deceased as Faridullah.
The hospital’s spokesperson, Dr Kifayat Bettani, said that two of the injured were in critical condition. He added that the injured also included two women.
A separate police statement said that soon after the incident was reported, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan arrived at the scene along with a large police contingent. The statement said a large-scale search operation had been launched and the scene cordoned off.
The statement quoted the DPO as saying that the “cowardly act“ was aimed at “disrupting the peace of the area”.
“The injured have been immediately shifted to the hospital, and the elements involved in the explosion will be arrested soon,” he said.
He added that the police were on high alert to maintain peace in the area and “all possible steps” were being taken to protect the lives and property of the people.
The DPO, as well as Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, also visited the injured at the hospital, according to two separate statements issued by the police. The statements said they enquired about the well-being of the injured and reviewed the medical assistance being provided to the injured.
The officials instructed the medical staff to provide the best possible treatment to the injured, saying that negligence of any kind would not be tolerated.
They said the injured were their own people and that the police stood with affected citizens in all difficult times, according to the statements.
The officials also extended condolences to the family of the citizen killed in the incident, assuring that those involved in the attack would be brought to justice soon.
They further assured that all resources were being utilised to ensure the protection of the public and that operations against terrorists would be intensified.
The statement issued by the RPO’s office also said that “terrorists were now targeting the public, considering them easy targets after their attacks on police and security forces had failed”.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
On Sunday, four police personnel, including three traffic cops, were martyred in firing by unknown armed men in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
Police said the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when unidentified gunmen, riding on a motorcycle, opened fire on them. Meanwhile, a cop in Bannu was martyred in firing by unidentified attac­kers in the district’s Kashfi Khel area.</p><small>2026-01-05 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0512352389623c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965241/head-hits-back-for-australia-after-roots-majestic-160-in-fifth-ashes-test' target='_blank'><strong>Head hits back for Australia after Root’s majestic 160 in fifth Ashes Test</strong></a><br><p>An imperious Joe Root hit a magnificent 160 to drive England to 384 in the fifth and final Ashes Test on Monday before Travis Head let rip to haul Australia back into the contest with a rapid-fire unbeaten 91.
Root’s superb innings, his 41st ton to match Ricky Ponting, was only ended courtesy of a brilliant caught-and-bowled by Michael Neser, who finished with 4-60.
Australia were left to negotiate the final session of day two at a sold-out Sydney Cricket Ground, which they did for the loss of Jake Weatherald (21) and Marnus Labuschagne (48).
By stumps, the hosts had raced to 166-2 with nightwatchman Neser on one alongside Head.







Weatherald, who needed a big score to stave off the critics, again failed to live up to expectations since making his debut at the first Test in Perth.
He was dropped twice in the space of three balls, by Root then Ben Duckett, before Ben Stokes trapped him lbw.
But Head, who like Root has slammed two centuries this series, was in the zone.
He clattered three boundaries off the second over from Matthew Potts, in the side for the injured Gus Atkinson, and there was no let-up, blitzing a quickfire 50 off 55 balls.
Labuschagne was also in good touch, stroking seven boundaries before thick-edging Stokes to Jacob Bethell at gully.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another win after victory at the previous Test in Melbourne.
Root joins Ponting
England resumed at 211-3 but lost Harry Brook (84), Stokes (0) and Jamie Smith (46) before lunch.
Will Jacks (27), Brydon Carse (1) and Josh Tongue (0), along with Root, departed in the second session.
The day belonged to Root, who started on 72 and reached an almost chanceless century off 146 balls to reaffirm his status as an all-time great.
The 35-year-old had begun the series under pressure after failing to make a hundred in Australia over three previous Ashes tours.
He snapped the drought with an unbeaten 138 in the day-night Test at Brisbane and his exploits in Sydney drew him level third with Australia’s Ponting on the all-time century-makers’ list, with 41.
Only India’s Sachin Tendulkar (51) and South Africa’s Jacques Kallis (45) have scored more Test centuries.







Root and Brook came together with England in trouble at 57-3 on Sunday, with both eyeing big centuries on an ideal batting deck.
But Brook only lasted five balls on Monday, adding six to his overnight 78 before dabbing at a Scott Boland delivery and edging into the safe hands of Steve Smith at slip.
It ended a 169-run partnership, not just England’s best of the series but the biggest by either team, surpassing Head and Alex Carey’s 162 in Adelaide.
Stokes only survived 11 balls before getting the faintest of edges off Mitchell Starc to Carey.
Jamie Smith lived dangerously and was fortunate to survive after chipping Cameron Green to Labuschagne at cover on 22. He began walking off but replays showed Green overstepped and it was a no-ball.
He added another 24 before medium-pacer Labuschagne bagged him in his first over.
The run rate slowed significantly after lunch when the new ball was taken, but Root persisted, passing 150 for a 17th time, just one behind the legendary Don Bradman and three short of Tendulkar.
He and Jacks put on 52 for the seventh wicket until Jacks sent a leading edge to Green in the gully off Neser. Root was ninth man out and Tongue followed without any addition to the score.</p><small>2026-01-05 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0512242832179ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965246/we-can-revise-tariffs-very-quickly-trump-warns-of-higher-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>‘We can revise tariffs very quickly’: Trump warns of higher tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>The United States could raise tariffs on India if New Delhi does not meet Washington’s demand to curb purchases of Russian oil, US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday.
“They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.







India’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The US doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent last year as punishment for its heavy buying of Russian oil. Despite the hefty tariffs, India’s exports to the US leapt in November.
Encouraged by the improved trade data, Indian officials have maintained a firm stance against US trade demands, signalling limited flexibility in areas such as agricultural imports, while data shows India’s oil purchases from Russia have declined.
India is asking refiners for weekly disclosures of Russian and US oil purchases, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week, adding that they expect Russian crude imports to dip below 1 million barrels per day as New Delhi seeks to clinch a trade deal with Washington.
Modi has spoken to Trump at least three times over the phone since he imposed tariffs, but the discussions remain inconclusive.

The joint statement came after the conclusion of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.







“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.
“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.
The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.
“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.
“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.
“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.
Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.
Pak-China agree to enhance communication
According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.
Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.
They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.
Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.
It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.
Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.
China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.
Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment“ to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an ”inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.
“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.
It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.
The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.
China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.
The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.
‘Upgraded version of CPEC’
The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities,” the statement said.
According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.
They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.
The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.
During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.
They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan,” the statement said.
The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.
“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.
On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.
“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.
In October, China announced it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.
Agree to uphold UN Charter, oppose unilateral actions
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.
They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.
They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.
Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.
During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.
According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.
They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.
The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.
Pakistan and China also “reaffirmed their readiness to further enhance cooperation under the frameworks of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.
“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.
On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice. ”
Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.
The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.
It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027,” the statement said.
Reiterate support for a Palestinian state
On the issue of Palestine, Pakistan and China called for an “unconditional, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” and stressed the significance of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.
The two countries called for the “implementation of the two-state solution with the establishment of an independent state of Palestine”.
“The two sides also expressed their concern at the situation in the occupied West Bank, and urged the need for urgently addressing it,” the communique said.
It added that Pakistan and China also “expressed willingness to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts for peace and stability in the Middle East”.
During the meeting, Dar thanked his counterpart for the “warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation”.
“The two sides agreed to hold the next round of Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Islamabad next year on mutually convenient dates,” the communique concluded.
Dar meets mining delegation, visits embassy
During his visit to Beijing, the foreign minister also met with a delegation from China Minmetals Corporation (MCC) led by its Vice President Xu Jiqing, the FO said on Monday.
The FO said that the pair “held productive discussions on MCC’s ongoing and upcoming projects in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, Dar reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong support for MCC in advancing mining investment and promoting value-added industrial development.”







Separately, Dar also met the Chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), Chen Xiaodong, where the pair “reviewed socio-economic development cooperation“.
During the meeting, they “lauded CIDCA’s contributions to Pakistan’s development”.
The pair also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation in education, space, livelihoods, IT, and disaster relief, including flagship initiatives to mark the 75th anniversary of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations.”

His comments to reporters aboard Air Force One raised the possibility of further US military interventions in Latin America, and suggested Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they do not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the United States.







“Operation Colombia sounds good to me,” Trump said. He also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, “looks like it’s ready to fall” on its own without US military action.







He also insisted the US was “in charge” of Venezuela after the seizure of Maduro, but was also dealing with the new leadership in Caracas.
Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said at the same time that she was ready to work together with the Trump administration, asking the US leader for a balanced, respectful relationship.

 

“We’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in. Don’t ask me who’s in charge because I’ll give you an answer and it’ll be very controversial,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked if he had spoken to Rodriguez.
Pressed on what he meant, Trump said: “It means we’re in charge”.
Asked whether the operation was about oil or regime change, Trump replied: “It’s about peace on earth.”
The US president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait.

 

“We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said.
As he struck his triumphant tone, Trump also had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long,” Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership will be “hit hard” if protesters are killed.
The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro’s government as long as Washington’s goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela’s enormous crude oil reserves, are met.
Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. His capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation.
Top officials in Maduro’s government are still in charge and have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping.
“Here, there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemys provocations,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party.
Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.
Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”.
Venezuela’s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said.
The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid.
Vice President Delcy Rodriguez who also serves as oil minister has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela’s top court and has said Maduro remains president.
Who will run Venezuela?
Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump’s Venezuela strategy.
Trump said on Saturday the United States will “run” the South American country of about 30 million people.
But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed on Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change or elections.
The US is fighting drug traffickers, “not a war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC‘s ‘Meet the Press’. However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for “tremendous leverage”.
With questions swirling on Capitol Hill, an administration official told AFP that Rubio will discuss Venezuela in meetings with lawmakers Monday.
Trump has made clear Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez.
As news of Maduro’s capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago.
About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland.
Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro’s inner circle. But she has publicly contradicted Trump’s claim she is willing to work with the US.
Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro “if she doesn’t do what’s right,” according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.
The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark.</p><small>2026-01-05 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/032358310cf99ed.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964891/i-rode-karachis-new-double-decker-bus-and-i-think-you-should-too' target='_blank'><strong>I rode Karachi’s new double-decker bus and I think you should too</strong></a><br><p>Getting around Karachi without a car — or at least a bike — of your own is not for the faint of heart. Options are limited, from ride-sharing apps with eye-watering fares to rickshaws that will leave you with a persistent itch in the back of your throat. And then there are the buses.
Until recently, taking a bus in Karachi meant embarking on a battered hull adorned with kaleidoscopic patterns and emitting plumes of acrid black smoke — some of which did make its way into the cabin. Which is why the city’s new double-decker buses, which launched on Jan 1, are a breath of fresh air.
The development came more than a year after the Sindh government announced the initiative in October 2024 for the city of over 23 million that has faced mobility issues for long.
The towering red buses are a jarring sight for now, a hallmark of cities like London and Hong Kong running along Sharea Faisal, but they’ve only been in regular service for three days. Intrigued and always up to try a new mode of transportation, I caught one of the red giants from Press Club Chowrangi — known best for its proximity to Zainab Market — all the way to Malir.
Earlier, Hussain Mansoor — the spokesperson to Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon — told Dawn that the buses would run between Zainab Market in Saddar and Model Colony. He further said that stops were designated for double-decker buses along this route at/near Malir Halt, airport, Colony Gate, Natha Khan Bridge, Drigh Road, Nursery, Baloch Colony and Finance and Trade Centre.
Entering the vehicle, the lower deck was reserved for women, yet anyone heading upstairs had to pass through the staircase positioned squarely in the middle of the supposed ‘ladies section’.
Upstairs, a collection of men, children and a few whole families populated the two compartments — an enclosed cabin and an open-air space with a retractable canopy.

As children marvelled at the cars driving by below and most adults took photos and videos, the conductor came by to collect the fare, Rs80 for anyone stepping off before the Natha Khan bridge and Rs120 for everyone traveling further. After that, we were off, cruising along Karachi’s main thoroughfare as the open canopy let in a cool breeze.
Khurram, who was seated next to me, told me he got around the city on a bike, but wanted to try the new bus and see what the hype was about. He said the new double-deckers were a significant improvement over local buses — known on the street as Mazdas. “The fare is reasonable, matching that of local Mazdas but with a smoother drive and a better environment,” he said.
He remarked that he clearly wasn’t the only one who thought the experience was a novelty, noting that, “70 per cent of passengers are making videos on their phones.”
Khurram added it was the people’s responsibility to take care of these buses and that the government should bring more of them onto the roads.

Mohammad Ismail, a student who was taking the bus with his friends, said: “The bus is nice, but it lacks any handrails or straps for people to hold on to should they need to stand while the bus is moving.“ This reality became painfully obvious to me a bit later.
Ismail’s friends, Akram and Mohammad Sharif, said the fares were higher than those of local buses and government-run buses should be subsidised. Sharif told me local bus fares started at Rs50 for distances that cost Rs80 on the Peoples’ Bus Service (PBS), but the boys did admit these new buses were more comfortable and that “local ones often had pickpockets.”
Ali Raza, who regularly commutes to work on buses, said he usually takes the single-deck buses but managed to catch the new double-decker for the first time today. “The bigger buses are more comfortable and convenient because of how spacious they are,” he said, advising the authorities to extend the bus route from Malir Halt to Gulshan-i-Hadeed in line with the R-1 route of the PBS.

Shabana, who was travelling with her daughter, said she used to take a bus a long time ago and could see the improvement in the quality of public transport in Karachi. “We didn’t have many facilities back in the day, but that’s gotten better,“ she said, adding, “We have comfortable seats, the drivers cooperate with us, and the biggest thing, it’s not heavy on the pocket.”
The pair were seated on the upper deck, so I asked whether they felt there should be more space designated for women. Shabana responded that she didn’t really mind and found the journey comfortable and safe.
Habib, an office worker who usually drives himself to work, said he had lived in Dubai and found Karachi’s new buses comparable to mass transit in the Gulf city. He said he and his colleagues would take the bus regularly if they didn’t need to visit clients in different parts of the city. He gave the service an eight out of 10.
Habib echoed Khurram’s suggestion that the government should bring in more of these buses. They also shared concerns about the upkeep of the buses, with Habib saying, “Quality-wise, I think everything is okay because it’s just started, let’s see what will come after six months.”
He recalled using local buses as a student, some 20 years ago, and said they were neither safe nor hygienic.

Mohammad Nasir, one of the last passengers onboard and a regular rider on the PBS, said the double-deckers were better than other PBS buses running along the R-1 route because they had ample seating for passengers. The smaller buses, he recalled, were usually packed to the point where anyone in the back of the vehicle couldn’t make their way to the doors at their stop.
He said these bigger buses were great as long as there wasn’t any overcrowding, and called for more double-deckers on all major bus routes in the city.
Karachi still has a very long way to go when it comes to public transportation, with most of the city remaining underserved. Buses are few and often far in between on major roads, while rapid transit systems faces persistent delays — like the Red Line running along University Road.
However, the introduction of double-decker buses, and other hybrid and electric buses before that, provides hope that there may come a day when citizens aren‘t completely dependent on cars and motorcycles. These systems, while beneficial for those who prefer not to brave Karachi’s roads on their own, also help to reduce the city‘s notorious traffic situation.</p><small>2026-01-05 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695af5024b00a.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965221/a-lost-decade' target='_blank'><strong>A lost decade</strong></a><br><p>STUDENTS of late-20th-century politics and history might recall that the term ‘Lost Decade’ is used to describe the 1980s in both Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Though of qualitatively different consequences, economic crises induced by an inability to service foreign debt eroded incomes and crashed growth rates in these two regions.
In Africa, poverty rates went up and poor countries faced stark consequences of disease and malnutrition. In Latin America, the expected transition to upper middle- and high-income status never transpired. Deindustrialisation and stagnant incomes became the norm, leading to what economists now call the ‘middle income trap’. It is of some note that this decade also coincided with entrenched authoritarianism (of the military dictatorship variant) and heightened state repression in both regions, much of it in service of US imperial interests.
While Pakistan’s economy is no stranger to boom-bust cycles, a prolonged period without adequate real income growth has been a rarity. It is true that since the early 2000s, Pakistan’s economy has failed to grow at the same pace as comparator economies. It is also true that much of this lag is tied to domestic political economy dysfunction, given how others in the region appear to be doing better. But the general crisis has been of comparatively sluggish growth (ie, averaged out spurts and troughs), rather than none at all, especially in labour incomes.
That is until this preceding decade (2015-2025). Analysis of recently released Labour Force Survey (LFS) data by economist Ahmed Pirzada and others shows that the last 10 years have seen no labour income growth in real terms. From a baseline of 2015, inflation-adjusted labour incomes (wages) rose by about 15 per cent over a four-year period till 2019 and have since then crashed back to 2015 levels in the subsequent six years.
Much of this is attributable to the inflationary crisis that started in 2019 and escalated between 2021 and 2023 before petering out in the last two years. Average inflation over this time was 15.1 per cent per annum, at least seven percentage points higher than Pakistan’s historical average.

Inflation may have subsided since 2024 but dynamism in the economy is still missing.

The trend of income erosion in real terms is also reaffirmed by the recently released Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) data, publish­ed after a five-year gap. While the survey itself only reports nominal income, adjusting it for inflation confirms the same story as the LFS data, with at least a 17pc erosion on average since 2019.
Parsing through the HIES data also shows a few more interesting trends. The first is that purchasing power stagnation (over a 10-year horizon) or erosion (over a five-year horizon) varied bet­­ween urban and rural households. The former experienced much greater erosion than the latter. In fact, the difference in nominal wage grow­­th between average rural and urban incomes was nearly 20pc.
One can speculate on the causes behind this divergence, but in part it reflects that economic shocks, including those induced by Covid-19, impacted urban households in myriad ways. It also shows that increased rates of urbanisation combined with labour absorption in low-wage, low-productivity sectors, as shown in the recent LFS data such as construction, retail and wholesale trade, and personal and community services, are generating a new ‘precariat’ class that is far more vulnerable to inflationary crises.

 

Relatedly, there is an inequality story at play here as well. If one looks at nominal income grow­­th in the past five years, it was highest for those in the top-most consumption/income quintile and lowest for those in the bottom, across both urban and rural areas. So not only is there widespread erosion of purchasing power, but it is far more operative among low-income households.
Some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that urban households in the top-most quintile lost 11pc of their purchasing power, while urban households in the bottom-most quintile lost 21pc of their purchasing power during the same period. Coupled with faster growth in top-quintile consumption, exacerbating inequality now goes hand in hand with increased precarity.
This data affirms what many have personally witnessed, felt, and experienced in the last few years. Economic opportunities have shrunk, hou­sehold budgets have become considerably more constrained, and families teetering on the brink have been pushed into poverty. The lower middle- and middle-income segment has borne the ig­­no­­miny of rapid downward mobility, while low-income households have become further entrapped in poverty.
Inflation may have subsided since 2024 but dynamism in the economy is still missing. LFS data shows a structural transformation that is pushing people out of agriculture and into waged work. But the destination of this waged work is various service sector industries, most of which do not promise stability, higher productivity, or greater economic mobility. An increasingly large number is now reliant on extended assistance to meet basic consumption requirements, from both the government and informal or family sources.
While it is politically useful and justifiable to blame one specific government or another for inducing a lost decade, the fact is that each government in this period (three in total) has inherited a balance-of-payments crisis, each has had to pursue macroeconomic stabilisation under IMF tutelage, and each has taken a series of expedient decisions that hollow out prospects for sustained growth in the future.
Such shared failure, thus, is a failure to correct dysfunction. And in turn, this failure is rooted in the absence of a viable political project that puts broad-based, welfare-enhancing growth as its primary objective. Instead, Pakistanis have to suffer through the pantomime of short-term geostrategic rent-seeking and the subsequent distribution of those rents to a narrow sliver of the population largely to keep a particular set of actors and their affiliated institution in power.

Needed is a national agenda on which to build a political consensus to help position the country on a sustainable path to durable political and economic stability.
The first order of business should be to establish a calm and peaceful political environment by a truce between the government and opposition. A divided and polarised nation cannot be a stable country. Hard as it may be, given the lack of trust, political parties and other stakeholders should try to de-escalate unending tensions and confrontation that create so much uncertainty and disruption in the country.
PTI seems willing for a dialogue with a government it has never recognised as legitimate. This creates an opportunity that may not last long. PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s recent statement calling for “political reconciliation” is a positive move that should be taken forward.
The government has offered talks from time to time but never shown enough seriousness. It has usually accompanied such ‘overtures’ with rhetoric that demonises the opposition. Moreover, the way it has used parliament as a rubber stamp, bulldozed constitutional amendments through the legislature to undermine an independent judiciary and cracked down on opposition and dissent has laid bare its disregard rather than respect for democracy.

Overlapping challenges facing the country are a test of leadership for all political stakeholders.

Of course, the elephant in the room is the establishment, which seems unreconciled to the idea of an accommodation between the government and opposition. It would much rather have the government keep the opposition off balance and under unrelenting pressure. Recent statements and pressers by the military spokesman taking aim at PTI have been harder-hitting than in the past. This doesn’t suggest softening in the establishment’s stance on encouraging a government-opposition modus vivendi.
The opposition represents a large section of society and enjoys significant electoral support across the country. Actions to exclude it from the political process and repress it do nothing to create political stability. Unilateral rule not only erodes democracy but also undermines effective governance. The country’s federal nature makes it imperative to operate the political system in an inclusive way, not least because the centre has to work with and not against opposition-run provinces.

 

Obviously, economic revival must be on top of the national agenda. While the government has done a reasonable job at macroeconomic stabilisation with the help of an IMF bailout and other external resources, this is a short-term gain and rests on unsustainable factors (borrowing and loan rollovers from friendly countries). The debt burden is high and foreign exchange reserves low in the face of heavy external financing needs ahead (around $23 billion over the next five years). Meaningful reforms to address the economy’s structural problems in the taxation system, expenditure outlays and energy sector are still not in place. The privatisation of PIA is a positive development but there is a long way to go to privatise other loss-making state-owned enterprises that are such a financial drain on the exchequer.
There is as yet no credible plan to help Pakistan break out of the trap of anaemic growth, low savings and investment, high deficits, heavy borrowing and growing indebtedness. Investment, including FDI, remains stagnant. It is widely agreed that Pakistan’s growth model isn’t working. Short-lived growth booms predicated on domestic and foreign borrowing are unviable. Unless this dysfunctional economic strategy changes the transition from stabilisation to growth and investment will not happen. The various stakeholders should put their heads together to frame an economic plan to tackle, not postpone structural problems and evolve a new growth model. An honest diagnosis about why economic growth has been anaemic for four decades is essential.
Investment in human development should receive high priority in the national agenda. But it doesn’t, despite the fact that the country’s growth and development prospects are severely constrained by lack of investment in human capital. In fact, the country today is in the throes of a human development crisis. This is reflected in deterioration in recent years in almost all indicators of literacy, education, health, poverty, gender disparity and other aspects of human welfare. That over 20 million children still have no access to school is a national scandal. The government has twice declared an education emergency but then taken no action. Literacy is stagnant at 60 per cent, which means 40pc of our population is illiterate. Economic progress cannot be achieved with this level of illiteracy.
The scale of poverty is also alarming. It has risen to 44pc according to the World Bank. Health indicators are equally disturbing with health outcomes some of the worst in South Asia A disturbing phenomenon and consequence of malnutrition and poverty is child stunting. According to a WB report, around 40pc of Pakistani children under five are stunted — a shocking number.
The uncontrolled rise in population and lack of government attention to this consequential issue are feeding into and exacerbating Pakistan’s crisis in human development. Population growth at around 2.5pc annually means roughly six million children are added to the population every year. This has far-reaching social and economic consequences. These numbers far exceed our resources and are putting enormous strain on the country’s physical infrastructure, job markets and health and education facilities at a time when the economy is not growing.
Population planning policies are urgently needed. Pakistan’s regional peers have almost all successfully implemented family planning policies. Pakistan hasn’t. Unless the country implements a comprehensive population control policy, whose elements are well-known, a demographic disaster awaits the country. An uneducated and underemployed population boom amidst a youth bulge without adequate opportunities being available is a recipe for social and political instability.
Addressing the security challenge from militancy and terrorism should obviously have urgent priority. Militant violence escalated last year with terrorism-related fatalities reaching a decade high. A comprehensive, whole-of-nation approach is needed in which sole reliance is not placed on kinetic actions but that also involves socioeconomic and political measures well as local community support.
These challenges present a test of leadership for all political stakeholders. Can they rise above their narrow interests to deal purposefully with issues that will determine the country’s fate and fortunes?

The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has formally admitted applications from Blue Gas (Pvt) Ltd, Essen Gas Marketing & Distribution Ltd and Master Marketing Inte­rnational for licences to undertake the regulated activity of natural gas sales.
In their applications, the companies said they would use the pipeline networks of the two public-sector utilities — Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) — to transport gas produced from local fields to consumers as permitted under the Third-Party Access Rules, the Pakistan Gas Network Code and virtual networks. Such arrangements are allowed under the 2012 petroleum policy, recently amended by the federal cabinet.

 

Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for Jan 16 and invited comments from stakeholders before deciding on the grant of licences.
The regulator has already issued about a dozen licences to private firms for the sale of natural gas, but only one company — Universal Gas Distribution Company (UGDC) — has been able to practically enter into gas sale and purchase agreements with producers, consumers and transporters like SNGPL and begin commercial operations.
SNGPL and SSGCL, which enjoyed a legal monopoly over gas sales and distribution for decades, formally lost exclusivity in 2010. However, the enabling legal and regulatory framework for third-party participation remained weak for much of the following decade, effectively preserving their dominance until last year.
In January 2025, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, approved the sale of 35 per cent of new gas finds to third-party private entities through a bidding process. The move was aimed at easing liquidity challenges on exploration and production (E&P) companies and attracting $4-5 billion in fresh investment in offshore exploration.
In January 2024, the Council of Common Interests (CCI) — comprising the chief ministers of all four provinces — allowed E&P companies to sell reserves to third parties and directed the petroleum division and gas utilities to develop a framework for the sale of 35pc of unallocated gas to third parties and get it approved by the Ecnec.
The two public-sector gas utilities had been delaying the implementation and lobbied to reverse the CCI decision for almost a year, but Mr Dar-led Ecnec finally concluded that neither the council’s decision could be reversed nor a prospective $4-5bn investment in offshore blocks could be postponed. The government has since awarded around two dozen exploration licences, both in offshore and onshore basins, to local and international firms.

The suspect, a Qawwal, has been accused of giving the event ‘political colour’ as the song was associated with the jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
In the FIR, the complainant, the Shalimar Gardens in charge, Mr Zameerul Hasan, alleged that the singer, Faraz Khan, deliberately tried to exploit the cultural event and instigate people, as the song was associated with a particular political party. He said a music and cultural night was organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority, which was a non-political event.
However, he alleged the singer and his companions sang the song, associated with the PTI leader, on the demand of some audience. He told the police that the suspect should have kept in his mind that the event was open to the public, and was attended by people having affiliations with different political parties.
The controversial song posed a potential risk of creating unrest or violence, the complainant said, adding that the suspect and his accomplices were liable to be booked under the law.

At the request of the government, a scoping mission of UN-ESCAP visited Pakistan recently, and held talks with ministries concerned and development partners to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities in Pakistan on energy transition financing. The team obtained a deep understanding of entry points to building a strong ETIP and understanding where challenges and opportunities may lie, UN-ESCAP says.
The country’s energy transition is critical for economic resilience, climate commitments, and fiscal stability. Heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, coupled with a circular debt crisis exceeding Rs2.6 trillion, underscores the urgency of shifting to renewables to meet energy needs by 2030. However, challenges like policy inconsistencies, fossil fuel dependency, and limited concessional financing hinder progress.
To bridge this gap, the ETIP can assist Pakistan by working to attract green foreign direct investment and leverage blen­ded finance models that combine public and philanthropic funds to unlock private capital. Concessional funding — including low-interest loans and guarantees — is essential to make renewable energy projects financially viable, especially for underserved communities.
Existing work on Green Euro­bonds, Panda Bonds, and Green Sukuk, alongside pay-as-you-go models should be bolstered to attract investment. There is also a need to investigate how funds support grid modernisation efforts, which are critical to answering Pakis­tan’s circular debt and integrating distributed solar and battery systems into the national energy infrastructure, ESCAP suggests.

 

UN-ESCAP through its Finan­­cing Energy Transition (FET) work which provided targeted technical assistance to Indone­sia, the Philippines and Viet­nam, has expressed its readiness to support Pakistan government with its expertise on the issue in conjunction with ESCAP’s existing work with Pakistan.
ESCAP’s FET work stream has already produced three analytical reports identifying critical gaps in energy transition finance, complemented by country-level capacity-building sessions and sub-regional policy dialogues in Southeast Asia. ESCAP through its expertise on integrated energy transition planning, capacity building, and scenario analysis may help contribute to Pakistan’s ETIP and its efforts on the national energy mix, industrial competitiveness, and progress towards Net-Zero emissions, while leveraging financial instruments such as green bonds and carbon markets, ESCAP says.
Pakistan’s energy mix remains heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, with imported oil, LNG, and coal dominating the power generation landscape – posing persistent challenges to fiscal sustainability and energy security.

Asia
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Balochistan chief minister and the president and premier of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday renewed calls for the implementation of United Nations resolutions on the region, as the country observed Jan 5 as Right to Self-Determination Day.
In separate messages, they reiterated Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for Kashmiris, urged the international community to press India to reverse its Aug 5, 2019, actions and called for a UN-backed plebiscite to determine the region’s future.
In his message, President Zardari said Jan 5 was observed in solidarity with the people of Jammu and Kashmir to mark the adoption of a 1949 United Nations resolution recognising the disputed status of the territory and affirming the Kashmiri people’s right to determine their future through a free and impartial plebiscite.
He noted that more than seven decades later, the commitment made by the United Nations remained unfulfilled, adding that the passage of time had neither weakened the validity of UN resolutions nor diminished the legitimacy of the Kashmiri people’s demand for self-determination. The continued denial of this right, he said, was in clear contradiction to the UN Charter and international law.
‘Durable peace in S. Asia’
In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said that the world must recognise that a just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was the only way to achieve durable peace in South Asia.
“We urge the international community to urgently call upon India to halt its widespread human rights violations in IIOJK (Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir), reverse its unilateral and illegal actions of Aug 5, 2019, repeal the draconian laws and give the right to self-determination to the Kashmiri people, as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to extend its unwavering moral, political, and diplomatic support to your cause, and will continue to serve as your voice at every available platform,” he said.
‘Not a political slogan’
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that Right to Self-Determination Day serves as a reminder to the international community that the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination is not a political slogan but a legally recognised international commitment enshrined in United Nations Security Council resolutions, which remains unfulfilled to this day.

 

In his message, the chief minister recalled that on Jan 5, 1949, the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan adopted a resolution granting the people of Jammu and Kashmir the right to determine their future through a free, fair and impartial plebiscite.
He said India’s continued illegal occupation and intransigence have consistently violated this international pledge.
Meanwhile, Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called upon the international community, particularly the United Nations, to play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and relevant UN resolutions.
In his special message on the occasion, President Chaudhry said that the Kashmiri people have rendered unprecedented sacrifices to achieve their right to self-determination, which was guaranteed to them by none other than the United Nations.
He said that the Kashmiri people firmly believe in the territorial integrity of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and regard it as an indivisible entity. He said that despite using all means of oppression, India has failed to dampen the Kashmiris’ passion and spirit for freedom.
Separately, AJK Prime Minister Faisal Mumtaz Rathore urged the United Nations to discharge its legal and moral responsibilities to help resolve the long-standing Kashmir dispute in line with the Kashmiris’ wishes and aspirations.
In his special message, the prime minister expressed dismay over the UN’s lackadaisical approach towards the issue, saying it was unfortunate that the promise of the right to self-determination made by the UN to the Kashmiri people seven decades ago is yet to be fulfilled.
He said that holding a plebiscite in Kashmir, as per the UN-proposed roadmap, remains the primary responsibility of the international community.

ISTANBUL/ADEN/DUBAI: Turkiye is ready to help dialogue between Yemen’s factions, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Saudi crown prince in a phone call on Sunday, his office said.
A recent internal conflict in Yemen involves the Saudi-backed internationally recognised government and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).
Erdogan told Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during the phone call that Turkiye “is ready to contribute to efforts aimed at bringing parties together”, according to his office.
Ankara is closely monitoring developments in both Yemen and Somalia, Erdogan said, adding that the preservation of the territorial integrity of the two countries was vital for regional stability.
The phone call comes a day after Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry called for Yemen’s southern factions to attend a “dialogue” in Riyadh.
STC hails talks offer
The STC has welcomed a call for dialogue by Saudi Arabia to end the recent military escalation. The STC said in a statement on Saturday that the Saudi initiative was a “genuine opportunity for serious dialogue” that could safeguard “the aspirations of the southern people”.
Tarek Saleh, a member of the Saudi-backed Yemen Presidential Council, met with Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman and exchanged viewpoints on Yemen.
They discussed means to bolster joint efforts to support the stability of the country and the region’s security, according to a post on X by the Yemeni official early Sunday.







’80 separatists killed’
At least 80 troops from STC have been killed in fighting with Saudi-backed forces and strikes since Friday, a military official from the group told AFP on Sunday.
Around 152 members of the STC forces were wounded and 130 were taken captive, the official said, giving a preliminary toll of casualties following the start of the operation.
Saudi-backed forces began on Friday operations to retake swathes of territory seized by the STC.
Most of the casualties had occurred in strikes by the Saudi-led coalition that targeted military camps held by the separatists, the official said, including Al-Khasha and Barshid military camps in Hadramout province.
‘Cutting off access’
Yemen’s government on Sunday also accused the separatists of cutting off the city of Aden and warned it would “take all necessary measures” after recapturing territory from them in the east on Saturday.
The government, in a statement from the presidential office to official media, said the STC had taken measures to restrict movement of citizens into Aden and that it had also received reports of a campaign of arrests in the city.
However, the separatists denied having restricted movement into Aden, but the government accusations indicate that hostility between the sides persists despite proposals for a dialogue that had raised hopes of a negotiated solution to the crisis.

ISLAMABAD: In what appeared to be a lost battle, the PIA Employees’ Combined Bargaining Agent (CBA), People’s Unity, has asked the government to put on hold the signing of the airline’s share purchase agreement (SPA) and the transfer of management control to the Arif Habib-led consortium until consideration of its reservations and a counter-offer.
In a letter to PIA’s board of directors, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Privatisation, the union alleged that the privatisation process culminating in the bidding was non-transparent, claiming that employees were not allowed to participate. It said the CBA had the expertise to turn around the loss-making national carrier through professional management and a competent board.

 

People’s Unity President Hidayatullah Khan said the government was repeating “the blunder” of selling the airliner to Arif Habib Group, whose earlier takeover attempt of Pakistan Steel Mills was declared illegal by the Supreme Court two decades ago and which had only recently penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan for cartelisation in steel sector.
The union said that, as the CBA, it represented employees and was a key stakeholder. “We applied to participate in the bidding process for healthy competition but were declined by the Privatisation Commission,” Mr Khan said.
He added that the union had “serious reservations” about the privatisation of Pakis­tan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) and the transfer of 75pc shares with management control, alleging the process lacked transparency and “valuation of assets”.
The union further alleged that the process — from expression of interest to bidding, approved by the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) and the cabinet — was conducted “without due diligence”, and claimed it bypassed the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
It also argued that the PIA Act, amended in 2016, authorised the conversion of PIA into a public limited company but did not permit “outright privatisation” through the transfer of majority control.
The union demanded an urgent meeting before the SPA is signed and management transferred “to avoid repetition of blunders” in earlier privatisation efforts.
Quoting the Supreme Court’s 2006 ruling in the PSM case, the union said the apex court had held that the privatisation process was vitiated by acts of omission and commission, including alleged violations of mandatory legal provisions and rules, which affected decisions on prequalification, valuation and the final terms offered and declared the process void and of no legal effect.
People’s Unity also alleged that Arif Habib Group and its facilitators (Public Office Holders) remained unaccountable despite Supreme Court observation and prequalified for PIACL privatisation prior to disposal of its review petition in the PSM case, which is still pending in the Supreme Court.
It alleged that Ayesha Steel Mills, owned by Arif Habib Group, and International Steels Ltd (ISL) were involved in cartelisation and penalised by the Competition Commission of Pakistan in October 2025 and were imposed a fine of Rs1.5 billion.
The union contended that blaming PIA and its employees for the carrier’s performance was unjustified, arguing that outcomes were shaped by the commercial policies and priorities of management and the board.
Threatening to challenge the case before the parliamentary committees and other appropriate courts of law, the People’s Unity pointed out that the PIA Act 1956 (as amended in 2016), the SOEs Act 2023 and the NAB Ordinance required management performance monitoring. “The PIA would have not been in this situation if any system of check and balance and performance monitoring exist,” it added.
It claimed that the PIA workforce had better knowledge and experienced to turn around the airline, if a knowledgeable board of directors and professional management played its role without privatisation.
The CBA offered to provide all technical and financial details with clarifications to the Ministry of Defence, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the Privatisation Commission and the parliamentary committees as to how to turn around the PIACL instead of “wasting time and money in unnecessary litigation”.

JERUSALEM/DUBAI: In a message meant to provoke the Tehran regime, Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu said on Sunday that his country stood in solidarity with the people of Iran, as protests over soaring inflation spread across several cities.
Rights groups estimate that at least 16 people have died during a week of violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.
Deaths and arrests have been reported through the week both by state media and rights groups, though the figures differ. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers.
“We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice,” Netanyahu said at the weekly cabinet meeting.
“It is very possible that we are stan­ding at a moment when the Iranian people are taking their destiny into their own hands,” he said, according to a statement from his office.
Netanyahu also addressed Tehran’s nuclear programme, saying he discussed it with US President Donald Trump during his official visit this week.
“We reiterated our shared position of zero enrichment on the one hand, and the need, of course, to remove the 400 kilograms of enriched material from Iran and subject the sites to strict and genuine oversight,” Netanyahu said, adding that the conversation took place at the outset of the “dramatic” demonstrations.
Monthly payment
Iranian authorities on Sunday announced they will give a monthly allowance to every citizen in the country to alleviate economic pressure, after a week of protests.
“Individuals can receive an amount equivalent to one million Tomans (approximately $7) per person per month, which is credited to their accounts for four months,” government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV.
She said the amount will be given to every Iranian for four months in the form of credit that can be used to purchase certain goods and is inte­nded to “reduce the economic pressure on the people.” In Iran, which has a population of more than 85 million people, the minimum wage is roughly $100 (85 euros) and average monthly salaries are around $200.
Iranians mostly use mobile phones and debit cards for their daily purchases instead of cash.
Speaking to state media, Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said that security forces had been targeting protest leaders for arrest over the previous two days, saying “a big number of leaders on the virtual space have been detained”.
The most intense clashes have been reported in western parts of Iran but there have also been protests and clashes between demonstrators and police in Tehran, in central areas, and in the southern Baluchistan province.
Speaking on Sunday, Vice President Mohammadreza Aref said the government acknowledged the country faced shortcomings while warning that some people were seeking to exploit the protests.
“We expect the youth not to fall into the trap of the enemies,” Aref said in comments carried by state media.

Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago club and in a televised interview, Trump characterised his actions as necessary for regional stability while directing personal invective at Latin American heads of state who opposed the operation.
He specifically targeted Colombian President Gustavo Petro with a warning to “watch his a**” and asserted that drug cartels have seized control of the Mexican government.
Trump’s harshest rhetoric addressed Petro, a vocal critic of the US military operation in Vene­zuela. Trump accused the Colombian leader of facilitating drug trafficking into the United States.
“He has cocaine mills, he has factories where he makes cocaine. And yeah, I think I stick by my first statement: He’s making cocaine,” Trump said of Petro. “They’re sending it to the United States. So he does have to watch his back.”
Turning to Mexico, Trump disputed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo’s authority, despite describing her as “a good woman” during an appearance on “Fox & Friends”. He claimed organised crime has superseded her government’s power.
“But the cartels are running Mexico — she’s not running Mexico,” Trump said, warning that regarding the neighbouring country, “something’s going to have to be done.”
The comments drew immediate backlash from the region. Sheinbaum issued a statement saying Mexico “strongly condemns and rejects” the military action against Maduro, urging Washington to cease “all acts of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people”.
Petro previously criticised the intervention as an assault on Latin American sovereignty.
The president also labelled Cuba a “failing nation” and suggested the communist-led island could face increased pressure given its close ties to Venezuela. The Cuban government provided security assistance to Maduro and relies on Venezuelan oil.
“Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now,” Trump said. “The people there have suffered for many, many years, and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a long-time critic of the Cuban government, reinforced the president’s stance. Rubio suggested that officials in Havana should be “concerned — at least a little bit”.
Mr Trump framed the administration’s aggressive posture as a push for hemispheric dominance and resource protection following Maduro’s transfer to a New York prison.
“We want to surround ourselves with good neighbours. We want stability. We want energy,” Trump said. “That country has tremendous energy, and it’s very important that we protect it.”

The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the formation of a special committee to probe the frequent offloading of travellers, which has triggered growing concern and criticism from affected passengers.
Taking to his X account, Naqvi wrote: “Pleased to share that the Federal Investigation Agency (@FIA Pakistan) has launched Pre-Departure Facilitation Desks across all zonal offices with immediate effect.”







According to the FIA, the initiative aims to provide guidance and assistance to international travellers on immigration procedures and clearances, ensuring a smoother and more hassle-free travel experience.
The desks have been established in eleven zones – including Islamabad’s G/6 zonal office — and will be accessible for intending international travellers, as well as through helplines and email services.
An FIA spokesman told Dawn the desks will be operational for international travellers on Saturday and Sunday, with experienced immigration staff deputed to facilitate citizens.
“The immigration staff, headed by the assistant director and assisted by an inspector and a sub-inspector, will be available for citizens to provide them with details of visa documents required to travel, which visa is needed, a return ticket and how much currency they can keep with them, among other details,” he said.
The spokesman said the facilitation desks have been set up at FIA zonal offices for international travellers — both locals and foreigners — seeking travel-related information, with immigration staff available from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Sunday.
“Main zonal offices are located across the country, including Islamabad serving the federal capital territory, Karachi covering Sindh, Lahore covering Punjab, Peshawar covering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Quetta covering Balochistan. Zonal offices are also located in Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Multan,” he added.
Last month, FIA authorities told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development that it offloaded 66,154 passengers from Pakistani Airports in 2025 compared to 2024’s figure of 35,000.
Initially, FIA authorities were reluctant to share details of the large-scale offloading of international travellers, despite repeated media queries and complaints from passengers who said they were stopped despite holding valid travel documents.</p><small>2026-01-05 02:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04234820f682c69.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965075/indias-abeyance-claim-has-no-standing-under-treaty-law-pakistan-commissioner-for-indus-waters' target='_blank'><strong>India’s ‘abeyance’ claim has no standing under treaty law: Pakistan commissioner for Indus Waters</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehar Ali Shah on Sunday said India’s claim of placing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” has no legal basis and that the treaty remains fully in force under international law.
In April 2025, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration held that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
Speaking on Geo News‘ programme ‘Jirga’, Shah talked about the legality of India holding the IWT in abeyance and said: “As far as holding the treaty in abeyance is concerned, the word ‘abeyance’ is not recognised under international treaty law. It is a coined term, because we believe India understands that it cannot suspend, breach or terminate the treaty.”
However, he cautioned that India’s continued non-cooperation within the rules-based framework, effectively sidestepping its obligations on self-created grounds, was “alarming”, prompting Pakistan to pursue a formal and carefully calibrated legal and diplomatic response.
“To address this, Pakistan is employing efforts carefully, and whatever steps are being taken are formal in nature,” he said.
He said the treaty was carefully negotiated to withstand political tensions and disputes, stressing that its dispute-resolution mechanism was designed to prevent unilateral actions.



About Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s threats of stopping the flow of Pakistan’s share of water, Shah asserted: “There is no room for stopping or partially stopping Pakistan’s water. This also goes against moral standards.
“Technically, if one party is stubborn on diverting the western rivers flowing into Pakistan, to reduce it to stop it, so naturally, there have been inter-basin transfer examples in the world,” he observed.
“When we gave the three eastern rivers to India, we have been facing consequences since the beginning of the treaty. Sutlej is always dry, barring the flooding season. Ravi is dry,” the water commissioner said.
Shah reiterated that any move by India to reduce water flows to Pakistan “would be considered an act of war”.
“There is no fixed amount of water allocated to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the waters should be available to Pakistan based on the “natural pattern of the western rivers”.
“So far, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus are receiving water in a natural pattern. But since April 24, 2025, India has created three such episodes, which we picked up — twice in May and once in December — when they increased the flow and then decreased it for a few days,” Shah pointed out.

 

Speaking about the procedures stated under the “well-thought-out” pact, Shah said one clause stated that in the face of conflict, Pakistan and India will peacefully solve the water matter. “Otherwise, they will hand it to a neutral party,” he added.
The official noted, “The 12th and last article of this treaty has four provisions. In the last paragraph, it says that with the passage of time, some changes can be made to the pact, but both parties have to mutually agree; otherwise, the pact will remain fully enforced.
“And it clearly says that no one party can unilaterally change it,” the water commissioner stressed.
Asked whether the IWT favoured India, Shah replied that the three eastern rivers — Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — have a “geographic advantage”, unlike the western rivers.
Recalling the history of water disputes between the two neighbours, Shah said India halted the rivers’ flow to Pakistan on March 31, 1948, which Pakistan protested on a bilateral level and took the issue to the United Nations.
After the IWT was agreed upon in 1960, India first violated the pact when it was building the Salal Dam, with which Pakistan had issues, and they were subsequently resolved through the treaty.
“The pact does not have a guarantor as such, but it has its own mechanism,” the official observed.
The water commissioner said the basic feature of the IWT was that the western rivers’ natural flow must not be altered.
“India was allowed to use the western rivers for hydroelectric power generation only in line with the pact guidelines. If there is a violation, then any party can take the matter to a third forum,” Shah said.
Providing an example of such an instance, Shah recalled that Pakistan decided to take the matter to a third forum when India built the Baglihar Dam on the western rivers, “violating five of the conditions”.

 

The official noted there were two third-party forums where conflicts could be taken — “one is a neutral forum, and the other is the Court of Arbitration forum”. The procedure for it, Shah added, was that the water commissioners must inform each other and suggest whether the matter should go to a neutral party or a court.
“So if one party does not agree to going to the court, for instance, then the matter must go to a neutral party, who will decide whether the matter falls within their expertise,” he explained, adding that internationally recognised experts are part of the team when the issue is taken to a neutral forum.
“When the Baglihar Dam decision was taken, it was not in favour of Pakistan. The extent of that decision was only confined to the Baglihar Dam and it did not apply to any future development plans,” Shah said.
The water commissioner highlighted that although Pakistan did not agree with the decision, it was binding under the IWT.
“So in order to stop India from taking future decisions based on the decision of the Baglihar Dam, Pakistan filed a case at the Court of Arbitration for a general interpretation.”
Detailing more water conflicts, Shah said that after Baglihar, Pakistan raised the issue about India constructing the 850 megawatt Ratle Hydroelectric Plant on the Chenab river bilaterally first, and also went to a third forum.

 

The water commissioner then mentioned that Pakistan had also raised objections on the Kiru and Kwar hydroelectric projects in India, whose designs New Delhi shared with Islamabad prior to the April 2025 developments.</p><small>2026-01-04 19:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04195102c56d0e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965070/cm-afridi-clarifies-his-only-stance-is-acting-upon-imrans-directives-to-run-kp-prepare-for-street-movement' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi clarifies his ‘only stance’ is acting upon Imran’s directives to run KP, prepare for street movement</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday clarified that his “only stance” was to implement PTI founder Imran Khan’s directives to run his province and prepare for the party’s street movement.
Afridi had previously announced that Karachi was his next destination for galvanising party supporters after he concluded his three-day visit to Lahore, where he also met with the families of jailed senior PTI leaders.
In a post on social media platform X earlier today, the KP chief minister said, “I have only one stance. My leader (Imran) has directed me to prepare for a street movement, along with running the administrative affairs of my province.
“God-willing, I will implement them in letter and spirit. Any other news attributed to me would be someone’s personal assumption,” he added.







About his upcoming visit to Karachi, CM Afridi said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, “respecting democratic values and his office’s dignity”, has invited him for a meeting.
Afridi said he had thanked Murad for the invitation and told him that he would meet “the people of my province, and if they had any sort of concerns or issues”, he would definitely meet the Sindh chief minister to resolve those.
While the KP CM had earlier stated January 9 (Friday) as the date for his planned trip to Karachi, in his statement today, Afridi said he would pay a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid at around 4pm on January 11 (Sunday).
Afridi’s latest statement highlighting his focus on the street movement comes after it was reported that he had said he was ready to hold talks with the establishment on provincial matters and improve relations.
But, at the same time, he also said that Imran had not instructed him on anything regarding talks with the establishment, and that the ex-premier had assigned the task to Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir, according to media reports.
His reported remarks were from his interaction with journalists in Peshawar on Friday.
Afridi was also reported to have said that if “any ceremony or meeting takes place, he would definitely meet” Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
During his visit to Lahore, CM Afridi had cast doubt on the government’s sincerity in holding talks with the PTI and said he was actively making efforts to initiate the party’s street movement by reaching out to multiple stakeholders.
Asked whether he believed issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, Afridi had said during his Lahore visit that Imran had assigned the responsibility for “dialogue or protest” to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p><small>2026-01-04 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04191808baa7e6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965069/three-injured-after-back-to-back-quadcopter-attacks-on-school-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Three injured after ‘back-to-back quadcopter attacks’ on school in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least three people, including a school principal and Rescue 1122 official, were injured on Tuesday when unknown assailants targeted a private school with “back-to-back quadcopter attacks” in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali, local sources said.
For months, banned militant organisations in the region have been using improvised munitions like quadcopters to drop explosives, targeting security forces and civilians.
According to local sources, the incident took place in Khasokhel village, where “explosives were dropped from the quadcopter onto the premises of Al-Fatah Public School, injuring the school’s principal and security guard.”
Soon after the incident, a Rescue 1122 medical team reached the site to provide first aid and evacuate the injured.
However, rescue officials said that while rescue personnel were engaged in relief work, another quadcopter dropped a mortar shell near the scene, injuring a Rescue 1122 worker.
“All the injured were provided initial medical treatment and later shifted to Bannu for further care, where their condition was stated to be stable,” a Rescue 1122 official said.
Sources said that the attack triggered panic in the area, forcing people living near the school to rush out of their homes in fear.
Residents strongly condemned the attack on rescue workers, calling it “highly deplorable”. Rescue officials said their personnel reached the area despite serious security threats and continued their duties under life-threatening conditions.
A local told Dawn that targeting a school through a drone attack was “an act of hostility against education and a dangerous assault on the lives of innocent children.”
Government authorities confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway, while no militant group had so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
Parents and social figures of the area expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that attacks on educational institutions and emergency service providers were unacceptable. They urged the government to take immediate and effective security measures to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and civilians in the region.
There has been a history of targeting schools, especially girls’ schools, in several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as the militants in the region don’t consider girls’ education legitimate as per their ideology.
Earlier in December, the terrorists blew up a government girls’ school in Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, by planting explosives during the night hours. Around 250 girls were enrolled at the school.
In the same month, the lives of over 600 school-going children were put at risk when unidentified militants blasted a government primary school by planting explosives.</p><small>2026-01-04 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04190952bd0b68b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965059/fm-dar-wang-yi-term-pak-china-friendship-vital-for-regional-peace-stability' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar, Wang Yi term Pak-China friendship ‘vital’ for regional peace, stability</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Sunday termed Pakistan-China friendship “vital” for regional peace and stability as both leaders co-chaired the 7th round of the Pakistan–China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Beijing.
Dar reached Beijing on Sat­urday at Wang’s invitation, primarily to co-chair the strategic dialogue.
Following the dialogue today, the Foreign Office (FO) in a statement on social media platform X said: “Highlighting the salience of the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, both leaders reaffirmed that the Pakistan–China friendship is vital for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and for the two countries.
“They also agreed to enhance coordination at bilateral and multilateral fora,” the FO added.
The two sides reviewed the entire spectrum of Pak–China relations and discussed “key issues at the regional and global levels”. The FO further said views were exchanged on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), trade, multilateral cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges.
“The two leaders also agreed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations,” the FO added.







In a separate post, the FO said Dar and Wang jointly unveiled the logo for the 75th anniversary of Pakistan-China diplomatic relations, “marking the start of year-long celebrations to commemorate this historic milestone in a befitting and memorable manner”.







The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in Aug­ust, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Pres­ident Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.
Other high-level meetings
Dar, who serves as the deputy prime minister as well, also held meetings with Chinese dignitaries in Beijing earlier today, with exchanges mainly focusing on bilateral ties, according to statements issued by the FO.
Among those Dar met was Chinese Executive Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.







“The two sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepening the Pakistan–China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership,” the FO said, adding that the Chinese executive vice premier “appreciated Pakistan’s consistent support to China on issues of core interest”.
Both leaders noted the historic significance of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between their countries and agreed to utilise this milestone to chart a forward-looking vision for enhanced cooperation, including under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the statement said.
Vice Premier Ding conveyed New Year greetings to the leadership and people of Pakistan, it added.
A separate FO statement said Dar also met the minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Liu Haixing.
Dar congratulated Minister Liu on the successful convening of the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, the statement said.







It added that the two sides “expressed satisfaction with the steady and forward-looking trajectory of bilateral relations while reviewing party-to-party exchanges, regional developments, and progress on various projects under CPEC”.
They also agreed to jointly commemorate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China in a “befitting and meaningful manner”.
Dar, who is visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi, was received at the airport by China’s Special Representative on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Pakistan’s ambassador to China and officials from the Pak­istani Embassy.
75th year of Pak-China diplomatic ties
Apart from the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue, Dar was also set to attend events marking the beginning of the 75th year of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties, with both countries planning initiatives and commemorative activities throughout 2026, the FO previously said.
The dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism betw­een Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
As per the FO, during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers were also to announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
It had added that the visit formed an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflected their shared determination to broaden and deepen their cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development.</p><small>2026-01-04 14:10</small></div><hr>
