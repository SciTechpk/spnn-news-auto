Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the forces in general area of Mir Ali in North Waziristan District.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and resultantly, three khwarij were sent to hell,” it said, referring to the term the state uses for terrorists.
“In another IBO, conducted in South Waziristan District, two khwarij were successfully neutralized by the security forces. However, during an intense fire exchange, one brave son of the soil, Naik Mujahid Khan (age: 40 years, resident of District Kohat) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat,” the statement said.
It added that two more engagements took place between the troops and the terrorists in the Khyber and Bannu districts, resulting in the killing of three terrorists.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area against the security forces as well as target killing of innocent civilians, the ISPR said.
Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, ISPR said.
The press release added that the security forces of Pakistan were determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthened our resolve.
Late last month, security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-05 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05215210ea83ecd.jpg?r=215232' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/un-chief-urges-maximum-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff' target='_blank'><strong>UN chief urges ‘maximum restraint’ in India, Pakistan standoff</strong></a><br><p>Nuclear-armed foes Pakistan and India must exert “maximum restraint” and step back from the brink of war, UN chief Antonio Guterres urged on Monday, as tensions between the South Asian neighbours soared.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Relations have reached “a boiling point”, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their “highest in years”.
He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through “credible and lawful means”.
“It is also essential — especially at this critical hour — to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” the secretary-general warned.

“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.”
The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office.
It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief’s continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.
“While reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,” the statement said.
The premier reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to politicise international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan’s economic interests.
The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.
Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.
International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.
The UN Security Council was due to meet behind closed doors later today at Pakistan’s request over the crisis.
NA passes unanimous resolution, condemns India’s move to suspend Indus Waters Treaty
Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
The resolution was presented by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.
The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.
The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country’s sovereignty, security, and interests.
The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.
Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India’s cross-border terrorism: Dar
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said that the attack was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.
Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.
“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.
“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the upcoming polls in Bihar in October.
“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.
He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”
In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.
“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”
“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “false flag operation”.
 


“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.
“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”
The deputy PM asserted: “Pakistan has exposed India’s mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.
“But if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].”
He detailed that he has directed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.
 
 

“Let’s share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,” said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military’s spokesperson, where they accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
UK to ‘work closely’ with Pakistan, India to reduce tensions
Separately, UK High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott assured PM Shehbaz today that her country would “work closely with Pakistan and India for maintaining regional peace and security”, the Prime Minister Office (PMO) said.
In his meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz urged her country to play its part in de-escalating the ongoing tensions with India.

The premier shared Pakistan’s perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.
He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.
Noting that the UK enjoyed “good relations” with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad “would never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security”.
The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government’s “foremost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country”.
Iran FM meets with PM Shehbaz, army chief: report
Meanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir on Monday, state broadcaster PTV News said in a post on X.
FM Araghchi, who arrived in Islamabad late last night, also met with Deputy PM Dar.
 


“Key discussions held with PM Shehbaz Sharif, FM Ishaq Dar and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir,” PTV News stated, highlighting that the visit came amid “rising India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam attack”.
In his meeting with the Iranian FM, PM Shehbaz stressed that India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty was unacceptable and a red-line for Pakistan.
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, the premier shared serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behavior since Pahalgam incident.
He categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without sharing any evidence and said Pakistan had offered that an international transparent, neutral and credible investigation be conducted to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident.
While stating that Pakistan had acted with maturity and responsibility, the Prime Minister said, “India had, on the other hand, created a media frenzy to divert the world’s attention away from Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remained the root cause of instability in South Asia.”
Iran’s FM Araghchi conveyed warm greetings from the Iranian leadership to the prime minister and reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and also playing its part in bringing peace and stability in South Asia.
In their meeting, Dar and Araghchi exchanged views on the evolving situation in South Asia and the US-Iran nuclear talks, the Foreign Office said.
Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.
“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. As Pak-India tensions persist, FM Araghchi is also expected to visit India later in the week.
According to an FO press release, Dar shared Pakistan’s “serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour” and rejected “unsubstantiated attempts to implicate Pakistan in the incident”.

The foreign minister thanked his Iranian counterpart for making the visit at this “critical juncture”. On his part, Araghchi conveyed cordial greetings from the Iranian leadership and reaffirmed Tehran’s desire to further deepen bilateral relations with Pakistan.
Dar pointed out that Pakistan had “consistently denounced terrorism in all its forms” and underscored the country’s frontline role in the fight against terrorism.
Both foreign ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strong Pakistan-Iran ties and agreed to boost cooperation in trade, energy, and connectivity.
They also pledged to maintain strong momentum in Pak-Iran relations, including by maintaining an increased frequency of interaction at the leadership level.
Iranian FM Araghchi also called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss matters of bilateral and mutual interest, regional security situation, particularly the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
The Iranian foreign minister said that he was undertaking the visit on the instructions of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, and the President of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing understanding of Pakistan’s position on the current situation and called for restraint by both sides to de-escalate the tensions.
The president thanked the Iranian Foreign Minister for undertaking the visit to Pakistan at a critical juncture.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue and diplomacy, while expressing concern over India’s aggressive posture, which he said was endangering regional peace and stability.
China reaffirms ‘time-tested friendship’ with Pakistan
Earlier today, China reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.

During today’s meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, PM thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday spoke to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.
When war breaks out, you can’t control it: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, appearing on Samaa TV programme ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a “befitting response”, adding that it would be “a level above what they do”.
“If they attack, which I can’t define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.
“Once war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,” he said. “Starting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.
“Modi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,” Asif added. “Political compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.”
 


Info minister refutes claims of ‘terrorist hideouts’ during LoC visit
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.
“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” Radio Pakistan noted.
Among the group of international journalists was CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson.
 


According to Radio Pakistan, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.
The CNN editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.
Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.
“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.

“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.
He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”
“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.
Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.
The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, PTV News added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.
Pakistani troops had previously responded to “unprovoked” Indian firing on April 30. Both countries have reportedly been trading small arms fire since April 25.
 


Pakistan to brief UNSC on latest regional developments
Acting on a global level, Islamabad has decided to seek an immediate session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.
The Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
 
 

“Pakistan will particularly brief the UNSC on how India’s aggressive actions, repeated provocations and inflammatory rhetoric pose a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability”, an FO press release issued today said.
It added that Pakistan would call upon the UNSC to “exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by taking appropriate measures to address these concerning developments”.
“It will also highlight India’s unlawful and unilateral attempt to put the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of its international obligations,” the FO said.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.

The development came as the CB resumed hearing a case pertaining to the military trials and the subsequent sentencing of civilians for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The CB resumed hearing a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover­nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the widely-praised October 2023 ruling by a five-judge bench that unanimously declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts violated the Constitution.
The bench — led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan — is reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts is constitutional or not.
During the hearing, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan appeared as the state counsel.
TV analyst Hafeezullah Niazi, father of Hassaan Niazi who was among those convicted by military courts over the riots, also attended the hearing.
As the bench reserved its verdict on the long-standing case, Justice Aminuddin said the court will issue its short order on the decision this week.
The hearing
At the outset of today’s hearing, AGP Awan said he would begin his arguments by detailing what happened on May 9, 2023.
“Our country is in a state of war almost all year round,” he said. “Army installations were attacked under a well-thought-out plan; on May 9, 49 places were attacked from 3pm onwards,” he said.
He noted that a prime minister had been hanged in Pakistan — referring to the hanging of ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto — but even then, there was no such protest. “No political party had attacked the army in the past.”
The attorney general further referenced Pakistan’s political history, saying that all parties had been banned during the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).
 
 

“The entire MRD leadership was in chains — Asghar Khan was under house arrest for three and a half years,” the AGP said. “Even during this time, no one took a step like people did on May 9.”
“Even if this was a reaction to May 9, it cannot be allowed; ours is not an ordinary country,” the AGP said. “Due to geography, we face a lot of threats.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked that the question before the court was not about whether a crime was committed, saying: “You come to the appeal, tell us about the appeal.”
As he continued his arguments, AGP Awan said that the army took departmental action for negligence in the Jinnah House attack.
“Three senior officers were retired without pension and benefits, including a lieutenant general, a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel,” he said.
“Dissatisfaction was expressed with the performance of 14 officers, dislike and distrust mean that they cannot get any further promotion,” the AGP said.
To this, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the army had initiated criminal proceedings against any army officer.
The attorney general said that criminal action would have been taken only when a crime had been committed, noting that departmental action had been taken for not stopping the incidents of May 9.
 
 

“The Army Act is clear that departmental action will also be accompanied by criminal punishment,” Justice Mandokhail replied.
AGP Awan then said that he would present arguments on May 9, as well as the July 21 decision and appeal.
“There were 23 incidents in Punjab, eight in KP, seven in Sindh and one in Balochistan. General Headquarters, Lahore, Mianwali Air Base, and ISI offices were attacked.
“All the incidents on May 9 were not accidental — the entire corps was inactive from 5:30pm to 9pm. If there was an external aggression on Lahore on May 9, it could not have been responded to,” the AGP said.
Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi remarked that at the time of Bhutto’s execution, people were making arrests and people set themselves on fire and self-immolated. “No one set property on fire at that time.”
The attorney general was in agreement, saying that his father himself had faced cases as a political activist yet it never occurred to anyone to damage the property by burning it.
Justice Hilali asked whether the gate of Jinnah House was broken open or if someone had opened it from inside. “If someone opened it from inside, it would be a crime of collusion,” she added.
The AGP said he would check about it and then apprise the court.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether what happened on May 9 was done with the intention of committing a crime.
 
 

“Was the intention to register a protest or to attack? Maybe the intention was to protest but the matter got out of hand. It should not have gone beyond the limit but it did,” Justice Mandokhail said.
“What happened on May 9 was a crime,” AGP Awan asserted.
Here, Justice Afghan told the attorney general that he had gone down the wrong path.
“We did not allow anyone to talk about the merits of the May 9 incident. Talking about the merits will affect the cases in the trial and appeal. If we go into the details of May 9, many questions will arise.
“Many questions arise that you may not be able to answer, such as whether the general who retired without pension was the Lahore Corps Commander,” Justice Afghan said.
AGP Awan responded in the affirmative that a Lahore Corps Commander was retired without pension benefits. When asked if the Lahore Corps Commander appeared as a witness before the trial court, the attorney general said the court would find out once the appeal is filed.
The state lawyer then asserted that he was not debating on the “merits of May 9” events but answering the questions raised.
 
 

At this point, Justice Mandokhail and Justice Hilali remarked that they were asking questions important for the country’s future. Upon Justice Hilali asking how many times the Army Act had been amended, AGP Awan replied that changes had been made to it “multiple times”.
“Amending the Constitution is a difficult task but the 26th Amendment was introduced. Why was the Army Act not amended? What is in the Official Secrets Act that even easy amendments are not introduced in it?” Justice Hilali asked.
AGP Awan then informed the court that so far, 86 individuals have filed appeals against their military court convictions. “Others will be given time to file an appeal,” he added.
Upon the attorney general saying that out of 45 minutes he had sought for arguments, he had allotted 20 minutes for Justice Mandokhail’s queries, the judge said: “I have no issue of my own. I am [only] thinking of the country’s future.”
Here, the AGP requested the bench to include an “observation” in its final ruling on the right to appeal of the convicted persons.
He recalled that there was a previous SC ruling advising the parliament to legislate to allow the extension in an army chief’s tenure. Justice Mazhar then pointed out that in that particular case, the parliament was given clear directions to enact the legislation within six months.
“Once a law is nullified, then the question of appeal does not arise,” Justice Aminuddin observed.
At this point during the hearing, Niazi came to the rostrum, saying he wanted to speak for five minutes.
He said: “My son Hassaan Niazi was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It was upsetting to hear praises that [defence ministry’s lawyer] Khawaja Harris did of military courts.
“Whoever violated a law should be punished,” Niazi added, recalling that the Prime Minister House, Parliament House and a radio station’s building were “attacked by mobs” in 2014.
 
 

“There was a plan to force the prime minister out of the PM House [but] those cases were heard in civilian courts,” Niazi contended.
He further argued that the crimes of the May 9 riots “could not be greater than a foreign conspiracy”. “We should have faith in our Supreme Court and civil courts,” the PTI activist’s father said, stating he wanted to see the rule of law in his country during his life.
When Niazi mentioned some Indian media reports on Kot Lakhpat jail where his son is imprisoned, Justice Hilali then assured Niazi: “Do not worry. Nothing of the sort will happen.”
Justice Mandokhail asserted, “Our (Pakistan’s) defence is strong.”
Military courts’ sentences
On Dec 13, 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of 85 civilians who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
Subsequently, on December 21, military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another 60 civilians were handed jail terms of a similar period over the matter.
On January 2, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.
The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the PTI, but the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p><small>2025-05-05 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0512475000dae44.png?r=124808' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908595/pakistan-tests-launch-of-120km-range-fatah-missile-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan tests launch of 120km-range Fatah missile: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing “Ex Indus”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the ISPR statement read.
 






The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army, as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations, the military’s media wing said.
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.
“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,” the ISPR added.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.
“The president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country’s defence.
“[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister Office.
“The success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defence,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.
In May last year, the army conducted a test-launch of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400km.
The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy’s anti-ballistic missile systems.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. Pakistan witnessed shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for a week since April 25, with the Pakistan Army responding to unprovoked Indian firing.
 
 

A day ago, ISPR Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar briefed members of political parties on national security during an in-camera session in Islamabad.
“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.
It added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.
India to hold civil defence drills
Meanwhile, India will conduct mock civil defence drills on Wednesday, government officials said, as fears rise of a regional conflict following the Pahalgam attack.
“The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked several states to conduct mock drills for effective civil defence,” Kanchan Gupta, a senior adviser from the information ministry, said in a statement.
Gupta said this would involve rehearsing an “evacuation plan” and the “training of civilians, students, etc, on the civil defence aspects to protect themselves in the event of a hostile attack”.
Drills will also test air raid warning sirens, prepare for blackouts and ready vital installations for camouflage.</p><small>2025-05-05 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/051924171faa961.jpg?r=192538' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908587/icj-throws-out-sudan-genocide-case-against-uae' target='_blank'><strong>ICJ throws out Sudan genocide case against UAE</strong></a><br><p>The top United Nations court on Monday threw out Sudan’s case against the United Arab Emirates over alleged complicity in genocide during the brutal Sudanese civil war.
Sudan has dragged the UAE before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arguing it is supplying weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been battling the Sudanese army since 2023.
The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has dismissed Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands.
The ICJ said today it “manifestly lacked” jurisdiction to rule on the case and threw out it out.
A UAE official hailed the judges’ ruling.
“This decision is a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless,” Reem Ketait, aeputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE foreign ministry, said in a statement sent to AFP.
Before the ruling, Ketait had accused Sudan of lodging the case in a “cynical attempt to divert attention from their own brutal record of atrocities against Sudanese civilians”.
When the UAE signed up to the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes.
Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
The war has triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.
The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.
The ICJ said it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute”.
“The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,” the court added.
A world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.
Muawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court last month, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”
“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.
Responding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.
“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” Ketait added.
Full reparations
In the end, legal experts had said Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.
“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.
The UAE had called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.
Sudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.
Khartoum wanted ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.
The rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.
Judges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and ruled that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.</p><small>2025-05-05 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/051921421afe011.jpg?r=192414' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908625/us-seeks-to-weaken-global-development-finance-efforts-un-document-shows' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks to weaken global development finance efforts, UN document shows</strong></a><br><p>The United States is seeking to weaken a global deal aimed at helping developing countries struggling with the impacts of climate change and other issues, an internal United Nations document seen by Reuters showed.
The Trump administration opposes draft reforms of the world’s financial system intended to help developing countries, including around taxation, credit ratings and fossil fuel subsidies. It also wants mentions of “climate”, “gender equality” and “sustainability” stripped out.
The previously unreported document sheds light on how the Trump administration is seeking to imprint an “America First” agenda, including opposition to efforts to slow climate change and promote diversity, on the institutions at the heart of fixing global systemic crises.
The once-a-decade, 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4) in Seville, Spain, in June aims to influence the strategic direction of the world’s development finance institutions. Countries agreed at FFD3, for example, to broaden tax cooperation efforts so that developing countries could help set the rules, and as of last May, more than 140 countries were involved.
“This conference is about bringing the world’s leaders together and setting the underlying rules and priorities for financing development goals over the next decade,” Tom Mitchell, executive director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, told Reuters.
Compiled by the permanent representatives to the UN of Mexico, Nepal, Norway, and Zambia, with help from the UN secretariat, the April 11 negotiating draft is annotated with the positions of the 193 nations involved in the discussions.
With ongoing changes at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the fight against climate change already facing pushback from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the document showed it was seeking to water down further reform efforts.
Among specific points in the text that refer to the systemic reform, the document shows the US wants to remove a reference to a “package of reforms” for sustainable development. It wants to replace a line promising to “commit to reform the international financial architecture” with a pledge to “recognise the need to enhance its resilience and effectiveness in responding to present and future challenges and crises”.
Such changes in language signal the degree of shared commitment that can then be used as support for action or inaction in future talks.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has acknowledged the need to overcome multiple challenges ahead of the conference, but urged “all countries to be at the table in Sevilla focused on solutions”, spokesperson Florencia Soto Niño said in an email to Reuters.
The White House and Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.
While the US position on development has become tougher under Trump, the negotiating document shows it remains supportive of efforts that include developing countries working more closely with the private sector, and fostering innovation and financial literacy.
Climate Change
A key goal of the global reforms is to better help poorer nations cope with weather disasters, which are worsening due to climate change, and to boost economic development using low-carbon energy rather than traditional fossil fuels.
President Donald Trump has quit the UN Paris climate agreement, slashed US foreign development aid by more than 80 per cent as part of a government overhaul led by billionaire Elon Musk and embarked on a trade war that is hurting many poorer nations.
Among areas of the FFD4 document that the US objects to is a call for countries to explore “global solidarity levies” that could include taxes on highly polluting activities or on the super-rich to finance sustainable development.
If included, the levies could be taken up in UN negotiations on taxes this year and would bolster a task force led by France, Kenya and Barbados that aims to develop such taxes among smaller groups of countries.
Other countries to object include Russia, Saudi Arabia and China.
The US is also seeking to delete a paragraph calling for companies to pay tax to the countries where economic activity occurs; a paragraph on helping developing countries bolster tax transparency; and another on phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the document shows.
Many of the world’s poorest countries struggle with high debt and the costs of rebuilding after disastrous storms, but the FFD4 document shows the US wants to strike a paragraph on reforming the credit-rating system.
That includes a push for raters to take a more forgiving approach to poorer nations that voluntarily restructure their debt to invest in green projects, it showed.
The US also opposes a commitment to ensure countries receive “adequate and uninterrupted funding on appropriate terms of social protection and other essential social spending during shocks and crises”, the document shows.
While the US has considerable influence as the biggest shareholder in both the World Bank, which provides loans and grants to developing countries, and the International Monetary Fund, and is currently reviewing its role in both, the draft deal is likely to change further as countries continue negotiations in May, before reaching consensus on a final document in mid-June.
The US position puts pressure on other countries to accept a weaker deal, since the talks aim to adopt a deal by consensus.</p><small>2025-05-05 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05141231c9eb281.jpg?r=141236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate on Monday to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in six intervals, previously stood at 12pc.
April inflation stood at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.
According to a notification issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.
According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.
“Overall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,” the statement said.
The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.
“In this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,” it said.
The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.
It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.
“Second, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers’ remittances,” it said.
It said that the surplus and SBP’s foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves.
It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.
“Global uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,” the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.
“Considering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,” it said.
Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.
“A sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,” the statement said.
“These factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,” it said.
Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.
The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.
“This outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.”
Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank’s likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
However, many experts believed the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
The SBP’s MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p><small>2025-05-05 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05154004fa4f929.jpg?r=154010' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908610/six-children-including-four-sisters-die-of-suffocation-in-sargodha' target='_blank'><strong>Six children including four sisters die of suffocation in Sargodha</strong></a><br><p>Six children, including four sisters, died on Monday due to suffocation in Sargodha, Rescue 1122 said in a statement.

Tensions between the two countries have spiked following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan vehemently rejected the allegation and called for a neutral probe.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company, the state-run NHPC and authorities in the India-occupied Kashmir, the three sources said, according to Reuters.
They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other projects launch similar efforts.
There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008-2009, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work, the sources added.
India’s NHPC and the neighbouring governments did not reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment.
The flushing operation ran for three days from May 1, the sources said.
“This is the first time such an exercise has taken place and will help in more efficient power generation and prevent damage to turbines,” one of the sources told Reuters.
“We were also asked to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which we did from May 1,” the source said, adding that the effort aimed to free the dam operation from any restrictions.
People living on the banks of the Chenab river in the India-occupied Kashmir said they noticed water had been released from both Salal and Baglihar dams from Thursday to Saturday.
Separately, Press Trust of India posted a video on its X account reporting that India has restricted the flow of water through the Balighar dam on the Chenab River.
 






‘Suspension of treaty means free will’
The flushing of hydropower projects requires nearly emptying a reservoir to force out sediments whose build-up is a major cause of decline in output.
For example, two of the sources said that power delivered by the 690-megawatt Salal project was far below its capacity, because Pakistan had prevented such flushing, while silting also hit output at the 900-MW Baglihar project.
“Flushing is not a common thing because it leads to a lot of water wastage,” said one of the sources. “Downstream countries are expected to be informed in case it leads to any inundation.”
Building both projects had required extensive back and forth with Pakistan, which worries about losing out on its share of water.
Under the 1960 treaty, which split the Indus and its tributaries between the neighbours, India had also shared data such as hydrological flows at various spots on the rivers flowing through India and issued flood warnings.
India’s water minister has vowed to “ensure no drop of the Indus river’s water reaches Pakistan”.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately. The treaty has allowed it only to build hydropower plants without significant storage dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
The suspension means India “can now pursue our projects at free will”, said Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission who worked on Indus disputes with Pakistan.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to renegotiate the treaty in recent years, and the two countries have tried to settle some of their differences at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.
These concerns relate to the size of the water storage area at the region’s Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants.</p><small>2025-05-05 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05144648b3eb2d1.jpg?r=144651' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608/escalating-tensions-with-india-to-impact-pakistans-economic-growth-moodys' target='_blank'><strong>Escalating tensions with India to impact Pakistan’s economic growth: Moody’s</strong></a><br><p>Global rating agency Moody’s on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan’s economic growth.
An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
In a note, the rating agency stated: “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan’s growth and hamper the government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan’s progress in achieving macroeconomic stability.”
 
 

On Pakistan’s economic trajectory, it said that its macroeconomic indicators had been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflationary pressure easing and foreign exchange reserves increasing amid “continued progress” in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
However, the agency noted that “a persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan’s access to external financing and pressure its foreign exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years”.
“India and Pakistan’s diplomatic relations have deteriorated,” the agency said, recalling Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s statement that Pakistan expected a military action by India.
Notably, the agency warned that India’s suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty could “severely reduce Pakistan’s water supply”.
In comparison, Moody’s said that the macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable, propelled by “moderating but still high levels of growth amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption”.
“In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India’s economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan,” it said, adding that the country accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of India’s total exports in 2024.
 
 

However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact on India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.
“Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,” it said.
It predicted that flare-ups “will occur periodically” as they have throughout the neighbouring countries’ post-independence history. However, they will not lead to an “outright, broad-based military conflict”, it added.</p><small>2025-05-05 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/051351220fc5570.png?r=135837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908598/poliovirus-detected-in-sewage-samples-from-18-districts-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>Poliovirus detected in sewage samples from 18 districts across country</strong></a><br><p>Environmental samples collected from 18 districts across the country have been found positive for poliovirus, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said on Monday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
“[A total of] 38 environmental [sewage] samples collected from 31 districts between April 7 and April 17 were tested at the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad,” the statement from the NEOC said.
“The lab confirmed detection of wild poliovirus type 1 in sewage samples of Loralai, Quetta, Zhob, Islamabad, Abbottabad, Bannu, DI Khan, Peshawar, Tank, North Waziristan, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Badin, Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Kashmore, Karachi, and Sukkur,” it added.
⁠Whereas samples collected from Noshki, Sibi, Islamabad, Charsadda, Lower Dir, Mansehra, Swat, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Rajanpur tested negative with no poliovirus detected, according to the NEOC.
“The Polio Programme is implementing a rigorous vaccination schedule to protect children from paralytic polio and interrupt virus transmission. Thanks to high-quality campaigns since September 2024, polio cases nationwide have declined,” the statement continued.
It added that the second nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025 was successfully conducted across the country from April 21 to 27, “achieving the target of vaccinating 45.4 million children under the age of five”.
“This remarkable milestone was made possible through the collective efforts of frontline polio workers, the Government of Pakistan, law enforcement agencies, health officials, and, most importantly, the commitment of parents who ensured their children received the vaccine.”
The next nationwide campaign is scheduled from May 26 to June 1, aiming to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five across the country.
The statement urged all parents to vaccinate their children against polio every time the vaccine is offered, adding, “repeated vaccination strengthens children’s immunity and protects them from the crippling poliovirus”.
It added that it is the prime responsibility of parents and community members to ensure that no child in their homes or neighbourhoods is left unvaccinated. Every missed child is at risk and can contribute to the continued spread of the poliovirus. Protecting children from polio is a shared duty and starts with timely vaccination.
In a separate development, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Emergency Operations Centre has enhanced the coverage of vaccination from 93 per cent in February’s polio campaign to 98 per cent in April in province, according to data.
Late last month, over 800,000 children were vaccinated during the week-long anti-polio drive that ended in Rawalpindi district on April 27, health officials had said.</p><small>2025-05-05 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05134630765c53a.jpg?r=140221' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908599/boxing-champion-usman-wazeer-lauded-by-sindh-cm-for-victory-over-indian-opponent' target='_blank'><strong>Boxing champion Usman Wazeer lauded by Sindh CM for victory over Indian opponent</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday met with boxing champion Usman Wazeer to congratulate him on his recent victory over an Indian opponent at an international tournament in Bangkok.

This development has brought relief to cotton ginners are grappling with a prolonged period of low demand and declining prices.
The recent slump in local cotton prices was primarily due to record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). This influx of imported material severely hampered local cotton sales, pushing numerous ginning factories and textile mills towards inactivity due to a severe financial crunch.
However, the tide seems to have turned in the past week. Reports of restored trade relations between China and the United States, coupled with a sharp decline in the US Dollar Index, triggered a substantial surge in cotton prices in international markets. Notably, the New York Cotton Exchange saw its July futures contract jump by a record 2.75 cents per pound in a single day, reaching a multi-month high of 68.41 cents per pound.
The upward trend is expected to continue this week, subsequently impacting domestic prices.
In Pakistan, this global rally has translated into a price increase of approximately Rs500 per maund (40kg), bringing the current cotton price to around Rs17,500 per maund. The renewed buying interest from textile mills has instilled a sense of optimism among cotton ginners.
Meanwhile, despite a consistent failure to achieve cotton cultivation and production targets in recent years, the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) has, once again, set an ambitious and seemingly unattainable production target of 10.18 million bales for the Cotton Year 2025-26. For the first time, however, the FCA has not yet specified the production targets for individual provinces.

Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
While financial markets are betting that US and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.
“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
 
 

“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of 10 per cent alongside higher, sector-specific charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.
Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over 145pc US tariffs, to which it has responded with 125pc levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.
In the meantime, companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux  slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.
Last week’s removal of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.
“We’re going from zero to 145pc, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy.
“I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”
Silver lining
The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.
China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.
Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.
“[This] means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.
However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country — which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple has shifted some output — could end up a genuine winner.
“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.
For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy, which by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.
The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts — something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.

But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example, if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.</p><small>2025-05-05 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/050834294e24543.jpg?r=083730' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908453/trump-may-extend-tiktok-deadline-for-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Trump may extend TikTok deadline for deal</strong></a><br><p>WEST BEACH: US President Donald Trump said he would extend the June 19 deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok, the short video app used by 170 million Americans, if no deal had been reached by then.
“I would … I’d like to see it done,” Trump told the NBC News programme “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” in an interview taped on Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, that is airing across the US on Sunday.
Trump said he had a “sweet spot” for the app after it helped him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election, adding, “TikTok is — it’s very interesting, but it will be protected”. Trump has already twice granted a reprieve from enforcement of a congressionally mandated ban on TikTok that was initially due to take effect in January.
 


A deal had been in the works that would spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new firm based in the United States and majority-owned and operated by US investors but it was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Democratic senators argue that Trump has no legal authority to extend the deadline, and suggest that the deal that had been under consideration would not meet legal requirements.
One source close to ByteDance’s US investors said last month that work on the prospective deal continues ahead of the June 19 deadline, but the White House and Beijing would need to resolve the tariff dispute first.
Trump told NBC News that China was keen to reach an agreement, citing the impact that 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods were having on its economy.
The law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 unless ByteDance had completed a divestiture of the app’s US assets. Trump began his second term as president on Jan 20 and opted not to enforce it. He first extended the deadline to early April, and then again last month to June 19.

Renowned Pakistan climber Sajid Ali Sadpara completed his acclimatisation rotation on Dhaulagiri, 8,167m peak, the world’s seventh highest mountain in Nepal.
Mr Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and started his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.
Talking to Dawn, he said he had completed the rotation at the peak and now waiting for weather to improve to start his summit push.
He said the summit push would start on May 9 considering weather forecast. He said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support in Alpine style.
Son of legendary mountaineer late Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Sajid has already summited the world’s eight peaks above eight thousand metres, including the world’s second highest peak, K2, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II in Alpine style.
He also took part in rescue operations at many peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 eight-thousanders peaks in Alpine style.
After climbing the Dhaulagiri peak without oxygen, he would be the summiteer of nine eight-thousanders peaks without supplement oxygen and porter support.
Naila Kiani aiming to summit Kanchenjunga
Also, renowned Pakistani female mountaineer Naila Kiani started her adventure to climb Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
According to a statement issued on Sunday, she is currently en route to the base camp of Kanchenjunga, an overland journey that will take her seven days to finish.
This expedition marks a significant step in her quest to climb all 14 of the world’s peaks exceeding 8,000m.
Ms Kiani has already summited 11 of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m. This includes Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gashe­rbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu. She is the first and the only Pakistani woman to achieve this feat.
Sirbaz Khan, Wajidullah Nagri
Likewise, Pakistani climber Sirbaz Khan also started his adventure towards Kanchenjunga peak to attempt summit the peak in Alpine style to compete summit of all 14 eight-thousanders.
He had successfully summited the Annapurna peak in Nepal without using supplementary oxygen on April 7.
Mr Khan is the first Pakistani climber to have summited all the top 14 mountains in the world. He is also the first Pakistani to scale 13 of them in Alpine style — without oxygen support, according to Karrar Haidri, the secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan.
The only remaining peak for Mr Khan to complete the list is Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
After climbing the peak, Sirbaz Khan will be first and only Pakistani to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in Alpine style.
Meanwhile, Pakistani mountaineer Wajidullah Nagri also reached the base camp of the Everest to start attempt to summit the peak.
Wajidullah Nagari has already summited K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum-II in Pakistan.

GCC Secretary-General Jasem Albudaiwi, speaking on behalf of the six-nation bloc, called on both countries to exercise restraint and prioritize diplomacy following a recent deadly attack in the India-occupied region of  Jammu and Kashmir.
Mr Albudaiwi strongly condemned the terrorist attack targeting tourists in Pahalgam,  which resulted in the deaths of 27 Hindus. He reiterated the GCC’s  “principled and consistent  stance in rejecting all forms and manifestations of terrorism.”
“We call for restraint from all parties and urge immediate resumption of  direct talks between Pakistan and India,” Albudaiwi said in statements reflecting the council’s concerns. He stressed the importance of resolving disputes peacefully according to international law and the  UN Charter to ensure regional stability.

Renews call for international backing to implement UN resolution on Kashmir

The secretary-general also warned against scapegoating and the “rising tide of Islamophobia in the region,” cautioning that discriminatory rhetoric could further inflame tensions.
Serious threat to regional peace
Highlighting the potential impact on global geopolitics, Albudaiwi emphasised that the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours poses a serious threat to regional peace.
 
 

The  GCC renewed its call for the international community to “intensify its efforts” toward finding a peaceful resolution to the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir issue, underscoring the need to adhere to relevant UN  Security Council resolutions.
The call for dialogue comes amid severely strained relations between India and Pakistan, with diplomatic interactions significantly reduced in recent years.
The  GCC, a political and economic alliance comprising Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, reaffirmed its commitment to supporting regional stability.
Separately, the  Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s human rights arm on Saturday voiced serious alarm over what it described as an alarming rise in  Islamophobia and violence against Muslims in India and India-held  Kashmir after the Pahalgam attack.
The OIC’s Independent Permanent  Human Rights Commission (IPHRC) condemned the “unfounded scapegoating”  of Muslim communities, attributing it to “far-right Hindu nationalist  groups.” The commission urged India to protect its Muslim citizens,  uphold international human rights obligations, and bring perpetrators of hate crimes to justice.
Regarding Kashmir, the IPHRC  reiterated its rejection of India’s “unilateral and illegal actions”  since August 2019, aimed at altering the region’s demography. It called  for international pressure on India to abide by UN resolutions, allow  Kashmiri self-determination, release political prisoners, and permit access for rights groups and fact-finding missions.

ADB President Masato Kanda announced the new target during the bank’s annual meeting in Milan, Italy. The expansion builds on the ADB’s September 2022 pledge to provide $14bn by 2025 to ease a worsening food crisis in the region and improve long-term food security.
By  the end of 2024, the ADB had committed $11bn — about 80 per cent of the  original allocation — with an additional $3.3bn programmed for  2025, the bank said.
“Unprecedented droughts, floods, extreme heat, and degraded natural resources are  undermining agricultural production, while at the same time threatening food security and rural livelihoods,” Mr Kanda said.

Move aims to counter growing threats to food production from climate change impacts and resource degradation

The assistance will fund a programme covering the entire food production process, from farming and processing to distribution and consumption.  Through financing and policy support for governments and companies, the programme aims to help the region generate diverse and nutritious food,  create jobs, reduce environmental impacts and promote resilient agricultural supply chains.
The additional $26bn announced on Sunday will include $18.5bn in direct ADB support for governments and $7.5bn in private sector investments. The ADB aims for private sector investments to account for more than 27pc of the total $40bn programme by 2030.
The programme will work to modernize agricultural value chains to improve access to affordable and healthy food, especially for vulnerable populations. It will also invest in improving soil quality and  conserving biodiversity, which the ADB noted are essential for productive agriculture but increasingly threatened by climate change,  pollution, and habitat loss. Support for digital technology and analytics aims to improve decision-making for farmers, agribusinesses and policymakers.
More than half of the world’s undernourished people live in developing Asia,  according to the ADB. Food systems account for 70pc of global water use,  50pc of habitable land, and 80pc of biodiversity loss, while employing  40pc of the region’s workforce, the bank said.
To aid the effort, the ADB is establishing the Natural Capital Fund, a planned $150 million blended finance vehicle. It has anchor support from the Global Environment Facility and expects contributions from other partners, including the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme.  This fund will support projects by farmers and innovators focused on sustainable natural capital management.
Food  insecurity threatens to reverse decades of development progress in the  region, where the ADB estimates nearly 1.1bn people lacked healthy  diets due to poverty and high food prices, which soared in 2022.
Global agrifood systems generate hidden environmental, social and health costs estimated at $13 trillion in 2023, or 10pc of global GDP, according to  the Food System Economics Commission. These costs stem from emissions,  land-use changes, water depletion, poverty among workers and diet-related health issues.
The commission noted that productivity losses from poor diets rose 14pc  globally since 2016, with South Asia seeing a 20pc increase,  highlighting the need for reforms beyond traditional production-focused strategies.

The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
The Israeli military said “several attempts were made to intercept” the missile that was launched from Yemen, a rare Houthi attack that penetrated Israel’s air defences.
An Israeli official said the country’s security cabinet would convene in the evening.

Netanyahu blames Iran as defence minister threatens seven times stronger response

A police video showed officers standing on the edge of a deep hole in the ground with the control tower visible behind them. No damage was reported to the airport infrastructure.
The police reported a “missile impact” at Israel’s main international gateway.
An AFP photographer said the missile hit near the parking lots of Terminal 3, the airport’s largest. The crater was just hundreds of metres (yards) from the tarmac.
“You can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep,” central Israel’s police chief, Yair Hezroni, said in the video.
 
 

The Israel Airport’s Authority said: “This is the first time a missile has fallen so close to the terminal and the runways.”
“The missile force of the Yemeni armed forces carried out a military operation targeting Ben Gurion airport” with a “hypersonic ballistic missile”, the Houthis said, referring to their forces.
Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened a forceful response, saying: “Anyone who hits us, we will hit them seven times stronger.”
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond to Iran at  “a time and place of our choosing” over the attack  on Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport.
“Attacks  by the Houthis emanate from Iran. Israel will respond to the Houthi  attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our  choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,” Netanyahu wrote on X,  reposting a March message by US President Donald Trump also  attributing attacks by the Yemeni group to their Iranian backers.
Palestinians hail attack
Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad later hailed the Houthis’ attack on the airport.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.
An AFP journalist said he heard a “loud bang” at around 9:35 am (0635 GMT), adding the “reverberation was very strong”.
“Security staff immediately asked hundreds of passengers to take shelter, some in bunkers,” the AFP journalist said.
“Many passengers are now waiting for their flights to take off, and others are trying to find alternative flights.” An incoming Air India flight was diverted to Abu Dhabi, an airport official said
It was one of the airlines to suspend Tel Aviv flights until May 6, along with Germany’s Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian, Eurowings and SWISS.
A passenger said the attack, which came shortly after air raid sirens sounded across parts of Israel, caused “panic”.
An airline official said: “Today was a close call”.
“I have worked at the airport for several years but even I was afraid today,” they said.
Flights resumed after being halted briefly, with the aviation authority saying Ben Gurion was now “open and operational”.
Gaza war expansion
An Israel official said Israel’s security cabinet later met on Sunday, after media reported a planned expansion of the Gaza war with call-up orders issued for tens of thousands of reserve troops.
Several news outlets said the military had begun sending the orders for reservists to replace conscripts and active-duty soldiers in Israel and the occupied West Bank so they can be redeployed to Gaza.
A military spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports but Israel’s public broadcaster said the security cabinet would meet to discuss the expanded offensive.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid deadlock over how to proceed with a two-month ceasefire that had largely stopped the Gaza war.
Sunday’s attack on Israel was the fourth the Houthis have claimed in three days.
Israel claims to have intercepted most of the Houthis’ missiles fired since the Gaza war started.
In March, the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on shipping over Israel’s aid blockade on Gaza after a suspension of attacks during the truce.
The US military has been hammering Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15.

Though the Commi­ssioner for Indus Waters was not available to comment, a source privy to the development said that the report sent by the commission to government mentions a massive breach of the treaty in the form of construction of three hydroelectric plants / projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab. The construction of the 450MW had reportedly been started at Chenab basin in 2005, followed by 330MW Kishan Ganga Hydropower Project in 2010 at Jhelum river basin. The construction of 850MW Ratle Hydropower project is yet to be initiated.
“The report also contains the information about other violations of the treaty by India such as delaying or avoiding giving information regarding release of floodwater during monsoon in rivers, including Ravi and Satluj. Besides these, there are a series of violations India committed already,” said the source while talking to this scribe.
He further said a very recent major violation committed by India was holding the treaty in abeyance that is not at all allowed.
He further said the report also mentioned that New Delhi suspended the treaty unilaterally on the pretext of the Pahalgam attack last month.
 
 

According to another source, India always faced defeat whenever Pakistan challenged and raised objections on the design of the aforementioned projects and took up these issues on relevant forums, including neutral expert or international court of arbitration.
“The proceedings on a couple of projects including Ratle are still underway at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a non-UN intergovernmental organisation located in The Hague,” he said.
Talking to Dawn, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, a former commissioner on Indus Waters said in fact the draft of treaty finalised in 1960 gave no privilege to India to use waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab on which Pakistan had the full right to use.
“India had full right to use  the water of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj) whether through construction of dams (for water storage and power generation) or other purposes.”
He added that a few months before signing of the treaty, India had started building pressure on the authorities concerned to also allow it to construct run-of-the river hydropower projects and small storages for irrigation purposes in the catchment areas of the western rivers.
He said since a lot of work has already been done on the treaty and there was no time to further delay, it was decided to allow India do so, but with some restrictions / conditions such as consulting Pakistan while finalising design of the projects etc.
He urged the government to brief the UNSC in detail about a series of violations of the treaty India committed.
“The Pakistani team may also take up this issue with the World Bank immediately in a bid to get the India’s unilateral decision of holding treaty in abeyance scrapped,” he urged.

Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes­sage stating the acco­unts were withheld “in response to a legal demand”.
PPP condemned India’s move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India’s action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident” which he had presented before the international community.
The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “It also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,” the statement added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s narrative on the Pahalgam attack “unsettled the Indian prime minister”, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the “Butcher of Gujarat” before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi’s war-mongering mindset.
Since the Pahalgam attack on April 22, the Indian government has blocked a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.
X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.

The political leaders made this pledge during an in-camera briefing by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.
The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.
A source privy to the huddle proceedings told Dawn that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.

Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam

Another source told Dawn that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.
 
 

Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.
With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.
PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.
Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.
Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.

Riyadh has been at the forefront of this effort and has been shouldering the major weight of the Opec+ output cut mechanism. 
In recent months, Opec+ cut its crude oil output by over five million barrels, some five per cent of the global supply. Saudi Arabia was contributing two-fifths of this output cut.
The effort, aimed at propping up the global oil market prices, was essential to meet the ever-growing budgetary requirements of major oil producers, Saudi Arabia included. Most Opec economies are often termed as single-product economies, with oil earnings staying crucial to meeting the needs of these petro-states.
But Riyadh now seems fed up with its act of propping up the oil markets by playing the role of a swing producer. Reuters reported last week that Saudi officials have been briefing allies and industry experts in recent days that they were unwilling to prop up oil markets with further supply cuts.

Inventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s

There seems to be some logic behind the Saudi desperation. Despite the Opec+ output cuts, markets have not been able to stabilise much. Crude has shed about 19pc this year, briefly touching a four-year low last month, as the Trump administration’s tariffs fanned concerns that energy demand will fall.
However, to some extent, oil busters within Opec+ had to be blamed for this market weakness. Some Opec+ members have been overshooting their allocated output quotas — apparently at Riyadh’s cost.
Saudi Arabia is not ready to tolerate it any further. “Opec’s decision framework appears to be fueled by persistent cheating, particularly from the likes of Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia, among others,” TD Cowen strategists, including Dan Ghali and Bart Melek, said in a note to clients. 
Inventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s, Bloomberg quoted them as saying in the note. Riyadh is also not ready to concede its market share any further.
This carries ramifications for the health of the oil markets and the oil revenues of the major producers over the coming months. Many years back, while Ali Al-Naimi was at the helm of the Saudi Petroleum Ministry and fed up with quota cheating by other Opec oil producers, Riyadh had to adopt the same path to protect its market share. 
The growing shale output from the US was also an apparent target of the Saudi policymakers then. Mr Naimi had told American drillers in February 2016 that they could “lower costs, borrow cash or liquidate” in the face of sub-$50-a-barrel prices.  
The result was disastrous in some sense. Market prices collapsed. This ultimately resulted in a ceasefire among the producers.
Today can’t be any different. Saudis are not ready to continue sharing the burden of the oil output cut, almost single-handedly, any further. With several fellow Opec+ members failing to adhere to their output targets and to compensate for oversupply in recent months, a frustrated Riyadh is changing tack, Opec+ sources told Reuters.
This possible shift in Saudi policy could suggest a move toward producing more and expanding its market share, a major change after five years spent balancing the market through deep output as a leader of the Opec+ group of oil producers.
Despite its dependence on cash flow from oil sales, Saudi officials have been emphasising in recent weeks that the kingdom can live with the fall in prices by raising borrowing and cutting costs, media reports said, quoting several sources. “The Saudis are ready for lower prices and may need to pull back on some major projects,” one of the sources said.
Saudi Arabia needs oil prices above $90 to balance its budget, higher than other large Opec producers, such as the United Arab Emirates, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Theories on the reasons behind the apparent change in Saudi strategy range from punishing Opec+ members for exceeding their quotas to a move to fight for market share after ceding ground to non-Opec producers such as the United States and Guyana.
Higher output may also be a fillip to US President Donald Trump, who has called for Opec to boost output to help keep US gasoline prices down. Some feel that Riyadh needs to oblige President Trump for political reasons. That may also have pushed Riyadh to change its track on crude output.
All these have an impact on the economies of the major oil producers. The IMF has downgraded its economic growth forecast for the oil exporters in the Middle East to 2.3pc from 4pc projected last October due to the slide in oil prices.
“Across the region, rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty are adding to the impact of conflicts and extended oil production cuts to weaken growth prospects,” the IMF said in its Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East and Central Asia.
In the meantime, the IMF has also downgraded Saudi Arabia’s GDP growth forecast to 3.0pc this year, lower than a previous forecast of 3.3pc economic growth, following the 13pc decline in oil prices over the past month.
In a welcome change, the projected lower oil prices could take some pressure off the balance of payments of oil consumers, like Pakistan.
