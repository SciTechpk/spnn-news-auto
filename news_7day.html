In a statement, the FO said that at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the president would lead a high-level delegation, comprising cabinet ministers and business leaders for the state visit on Feb 5-6.







FO added that the visiting dignitary will meet President Asif Ali Zardari, hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz, and address the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum.
“Discussions will focus on reviewing the entire gamut of bilateral relations and identifying new avenues to further deepen cooperation in diverse sectors including trade, energy, defence, education, people-to-people exchange and regional connectivity,” it stated.
The FO statement said that this was the Uzbek president’s second visit to Pakistan, “which reflects the upward trajectory in Pakistan-Uzbekistan bilateral relations and the brotherly ties between the two brotherly countries, rooted in common history, faith and common aspirations for peace and prosperity in Central and South Asia”.
President Mirziyoyev had last visited Pakistan in 2022.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have strengthened ties through trade and economic cooperation. A $1 billion trade deal was signed in 2023, and plans for further collaboration, including a roadmap for industrial cooperation, show the two sides’ commitment to boosting regional connectivity.
Last month, the two countries agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2 billion as PM Shehbaz met with President Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said last week that President Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan was expected to mark a new phase in bilateral relations.</p><small>2026-02-04 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/042333326d86bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971052/pakistan-urges-unsc-to-designate-bla-as-terrorist-group' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges UNSC to designate BLA as terrorist group</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan on Wednesday urged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to move swiftly to designate the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a terrorist organisation under its sanctions regime, saying the listing request was already under consideration by the council.
“We hope the council will act swiftly to designate BLA under the 1267 sanctions regime, acceding to the listing request that is currently under consideration,” Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, told a UNSC briefing on ‘Threats to International Peace and Security caused by Terrorist Acts’.







In his remarks, the envoy thanked UNSC members for issuing a press statement condemning the recent attacks in Balochistan and expressed appreciation for what he described as an international “outpouring of support and solidarity with Pakistan”.
“We remain resolute in eliminating this externally sponsored scourge from our soil and exposing the sponsors, financiers, aiders and abettors sitting across our borders,” Ambassador Ahmad said.
Ambassador Ahmad said Pakistan had paid a heavy price in the global fight against terrorism.
“As a frontline state in the global counterterrorism effort, we have sacrificed blood and treasure — with more than 90,000 casualties and staggering economic losses over the years,” he said.
Recalling Pakistan’s role in earlier counterterrorism efforts, he said the Al Qaeda “core” was “largely decimated in Afghanistan due to Pakistan’s instrumental efforts,” adding that Pakistan had also played a leading role in combating the militant Islamic State group’s regional affiliate.
However, Ambassador Ahmad warned that the security situation had deteriorated in recent years, particularly after the Taliban takeover of Kabul.
“Externally sponsored and foreign-funded proxy terrorist groups such as Fitna al Khawarij TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and Fitna al Hindustan BLA and its Majeed Brigade have got a new lease of life,” he said.
“Operating with virtual impunity from Afghan soil and with the active support of our eastern neighbour, these groups are responsible for heinous terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.”
Referring to the latest violence in Balochistan, he said the BLA had claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks across multiple locations.
“Just this weekend, BLA claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan Province that resulted in the martyrdom of 48 innocent civilians, including five women and three children,” he said, adding that “145 BLA terrorists were neutralised during the effective riposte by our valiant security forces”.
It is worth mentioning that last year in August, the US State Department added BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list.
In his remarks, Ambassador Ahmad also raised concerns about the evolving regional threat emanating from Afghanistan, citing findings by the UN’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team.
“These terrorist groups pose a threat not only to Pakistan, but to the entire region and beyond,” he warned, pointing to recent attacks in Central Asia near the Afghan border as validation of earlier concerns.
He also cautioned against the proliferation of advanced weapons left behind after the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.
“It has become imperative to prevent the billions of dollars of sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by foreign forces in Afghanistan from falling into the hands of terrorists,” he said, calling for accountability of “external destabilising actors who support, finance and arm these groups, including their proxies in Afghanistan”.
He urged the international community to respond collectively, without double standards.
“The international community must address the contemporary terrorist threat through a collective, comprehensive and coordinated response, including through the balanced implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,” he said.
Ambassador Ahmad also criticised what he described as selective approaches to counterterrorism, arguing that “counterterrorism policies have so far singled out only the adherents of one religion”.
“There must be zero tolerance for state terrorism,” he said, referring to the situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and called for recognition of “legitimate struggles of peoples against foreign occupation” in line with UN resolutions.
He said the upcoming ninth review of the Global Counterterrorism Strategy later this year provided an opportunity to “renew our collective resolve” and address existing gaps.
“Pakistan will continue to support multilateral efforts aimed at devising comprehensive and holistic strategies to combat and eradicate this menace through collective endeavours and cooperation,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-04 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04230341a4d48d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971051/imrans-son-kasim-accuses-govt-of-deliberately-refusing-to-process-his-and-his-brothers-visas' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s son Kasim accuses govt of ‘deliberately refusing’ to process his and his brother’s visas</strong></a><br><p>Kasim Khan, the son of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, said on Wednesday that the government was “deliberately” refusing to process his and his brother’s visas.
In a post on X, Kasim said, “My brother and I are trying to travel to Pakistan to see our father. For 914 days, he has been held in solitary confinement while his health deteriorates and he is denied access to independent medical care.
“Now the government is deliberately refusing to process our visas. Denying a prisoner treatment is cruel. Denying his children the right to see him is collective punishment,” he said.







“I call on international human rights organisations and governments to speak out and act before irreversible harm is done,” he said.
Kasim and his older brother Suleiman live in London with their mother, Jemima Goldsmith.
The development comes as the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the former premier emerged in mainstream media.
The PTI had subsequently condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
A day earlier, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking his “personal intervention” for the medical examination of PTI founder Imran Khan by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
Meanwhile, Imran’s sons, Kasim and Suleiman, said in December 2025 that the two had applied for their visas and were planning a trip to Pakistan in January.
However, this week reports emerged alleging that the government was refusing to grant Imran’s sons visas.</p><small>2026-02-04 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04222604f9301b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971048/cdf-munir-says-terrorists-facilitators-will-not-be-spared-no-one-can-rationalise-violence-on-any-pretext' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir says terrorists, facilitators will not be spared; no one can rationalise violence on any pretext</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday said that no terrorist or their facilitator would be spared, adding that “no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”.
He made the remarks during a visit to Quetta, according to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), where he received a “comprehensive operational briefing on the prevailing security environment and internal security operations”.
“The briefing covered recent terrorist attacks orchestrated by Indian-backed internationally-designated terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan and the prompt aggressive response of security forces, which failed their ulterior motive of compromising peace, stability, and development in Balochistan,” ISPR said.







The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The handout said measures being undertaken to further strengthen the writ of the state and ensure protection of the populace and critical infrastructure were also discussed.
During his visit, CDF Munir remarked that “no terrorist and their facilitator will be spared and all will be dealt strictly as per law and that no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”.
“He appreciated the professionalism, valour, and sacrifices of officers and troops of all law enforcement agencies in thwarting nefarious anti-Pakistan designs and maintaining law and order.”
The statement said that CDF Munir, along with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, visited the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta, where he met injured personnel belonging to the army, Balochistan Frontier Corps and police.
The statement said CDF Munir “lauded their high morale and commended their bravery and steadfastness in protecting the motherland from foreign-sponsored terrorists”.</p><small>2026-02-04 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/042134434033933.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047/there-should-be-no-politics-in-sports-pm-on-decision-to-boycott-match-against-india-in-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>‘There should be no politics in sports’: PM on decision to boycott match against India in T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Commenting on the decision to boycott the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”.
He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised.
“We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said.
“There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”.

 


It should be noted that the government on Sunday gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo.
The development came after Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup.
At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the attacks in Balochistan.
“Within three to four days, 180 terrorists were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.”
He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred.
“These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said.
PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since Marka-i-Haq — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other khawarij were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity.
Khawarij is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed.
He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work.
“It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added.
“The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.”
Switching gears and discussing the tensions in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”.
“Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.”
The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace.
Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory.
“The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.”
PM Shehbaz then spoke about his meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
“I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted.
“I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.”
The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing.
“I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it.
“I spoke to him again, and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added.
“I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-04 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04200014c6b205e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971044/washington-post-begins-widespread-layoffs-sharply-shrinking-storied-newspapers-reach' target='_blank'><strong>Washington Post begins widespread layoffs, sharply shrinking storied newspaper’s reach</strong></a><br><p>The Washington Post began widespread layoffs on Wednesday that will drastically shrink the size of the storied newspaper, affecting all departments.
Executive Editor Matt Murray informed the staff of the cuts, which will occur across the international, editing, metro, and sports desks, and come just days after the more than 145-year-old newspaper scaled back its coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics amid mounting financial losses.
“For too long, we’ve operated with a structure that’s too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper,” Murray said on the call, adding that “we need a new way forward and a sounder foundation.”
One Post reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a “bloodbath.”
The impacted journalists include Amazon beat reporter Caroline O’Donovan, Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker and the rest of The Post’s Middle East correspondents and editors, according to X posts from O’Donovan and Parker.







“The Washington Post is taking several difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,” the Post said in a statement.
“These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.”
All departments impacted
News outlets have struggled for years to maintain a sustainable business model after the internet upended the economics of journalism.
“All departments are impacted. Politics and government will remain our largest desk and will remain central to our engagement and subscriber growth,” Murray said in the call. “We will be closing the sports department in its current form.”
The Washington Post last year made changes across several business functions and announced job cuts, saying then that the reductions would not impact its newsroom.
The newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, had offered voluntary separation packages to employees across all functions in 2023 amid losses of $100 million.
“If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward that will,” the WaPo Guild said on X.







The Post’s White House staff said in a letter to Bezos last week that their most impactful coverage depends heavily on collaboration with teams at risk of job cuts and that a diversified newsroom is essential when the paper faces financial challenges.
Bezos said in 2013 when he bought the newspaper that he would preserve its journalistic tradition and would not lead its day-to-day operations. But there “will, of course, be change” over the coming years, he had said.
Clashes with journalists
In recent years, The Post has clashed with some of its journalists, who have openly criticised Bezos after the newspaper decided not to endorse a candidate in the November 2024 US presidential election, leading to more than 200,000 people cancelling their digital subscriptions.
The newspaper, which appointed William Lewis as its CEO in early 2024, also revamped its opinion section last year, shifting focus to “personal liberties and free markets”.
Bezos was among the several tech executives seen as making overtures to US President Donald Trump last year. He was seated prominently at Trump’s inauguration, underscoring his shifting ties.
Trump, who was a frequent critic of Bezos during his first term — over what the Republican president deemed unfair coverage by The Post — praised the tech billionaire in March last year, saying Bezos was doing “a real job” with the publication.
Todays layoffs at The Washington Post are a devastating setback for the scores of individual journalists affected and for the journalism profession,” said National Press Club President Mark Schoeff Jr, in a statement.

Xi expressed the hope that bilateral issues — amongst which trade figures highly — could be resolved amicably between the world’s two largest economies.
“By tackling issues one by one and continuously building mutual trust, we can forge a right way for the two countries to get along,” Xi said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
“Let us make 2026 a year in which China and the United States, as two major countries, move toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation,” he added.
Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform following what he called an “excellent” call, said ties between the two countries were “extremely good”.







“The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realise how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump said.
The president said he and Xi discussed trade, Taiwan, the Russian war against Ukraine, and Iran, as well as a planned trip to China, which he said “I very much look forward to”.
In Taiwan, however, Xi warned Washington to exercise caution in arms sales to the democratically-run island, which Beijing claims as its own territory.
“The Taiwan question is the most important issue in China-US relations…the US must handle arms sales to Taiwan with caution,” Xi said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
China’s Communist Party has never ruled democratic Taiwan, but Beijing claims the island of 23 million people is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to annex it.
Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, but is the island territory’s main military backer — although the tone of that support has softened slightly under Trump.
The United States approved $11 billion-worth of arms to Taiwan in December, Taipei said.
Shortly thereafter, China launched major live-fire drills to simulate a blockade around Taiwan’s key ports.</p><small>2026-02-04 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04223819ba9b6e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971050/the-resurrection-of-a-pakistani-sporting-dream' target='_blank'><strong>The resurrection of a Pakistani sporting dream</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: In family lore, the year 1976 shines with a particular light. It was the year of the Montreal Olympics, and a young man from Karachi named Marghoob Hasan Ansari carried the dream of representing Pakistan in field hockey.
Whether he stood on the turf or carried the hope only in his heart, that dream became a family heirloom — a lost legacy of sporting ambition that his daughter, Shehla Nasir, would hold onto. With time and distance, it faded into the realm of proud, silent ghosts.
Almost 49 years later, and 3,800 kilometres south, that ghost found its voice.
It did not speak on the AstroTurf, but on a perfect, frozen sheet in Coral Springs, Florida. It did not cheer for a field hockey flick, but for the thunderous clap of a puck against plexiglass. And it did not watch a son, but a grandson.
In the stands, surrounded by a sea of opposing colours, a small, defiant cluster of green flags fluttered. Among them stood the Olympian’s daughter, Shehla — her heart a storm of memory and miracle — as her son, Mahd Nasir, weaved through defenders in the colours of Pakistan.

Her feelings, when asked, stuttered into fragments.
“It’s beyond,” she told Dawn. “It’s just … so emotional, so nostalgic, so overwhelming.”
The words failed. They had to. How does one articulate the resurrection of a dream?
This is not a sports fairytale. This is a story of reclamation — of a diaspora stitching together a national team from WiFi signals and sheer will; of families bankrolling glory with second jobs and sacrificed vacations; and of a generation discovering, on the most improbable stage, a belonging they never knew they lacked.
The Pakistan men’s ice hockey team was not born in an arena, but in the ether.
Speaking from Karachi during a visit — where the idea of a national ice hockey team still sounds like fiction — Mahd recalled his first connection to the team.
After a humble, fun-first showing in 2022, the call went out on Instagram. Mahd, a forward raised in the hockey crucible of Vancouver, saw it.
“I saw on Instagram that they were reaching out,” he told Dawn. “They were featured on a couple of big hockey outlets during that first tournament, and that’s where I found them.”
He reached out to a captain. For six months, they talked. Then came the invitation.
Mahd hesitated.
“I didn’t know how the players would be. I didn’t know if I would click.”
He flew to New York to meet his new teammates for the first time. The first gathering was a study in awkwardness.
“It started at breakfast,” he recalled. “It was a little awkward.”
The silence of strangers — bound by a shared passport but separated by different lives — hung in the air. Then something melted.
“By lunch, we broke that awkward boundary. By dinner, everybody was laughing and eating together.”
In twelve hours, they lived the entire metaphor of their project: from disparate parts to a whole. They won bronze at that tournament — Pakistan’s first-ever international ice hockey medal — a historic moment wrapped in the quiet pride of beginnings.
The economy of dreams
Behind the glory lies an economy of dreams, and its currency is sacrifice. There is no federation money. No state sponsor.
“We don’t have any support,” Shehla said plainly. “We’re hoping we get some. We don’t have any support there, and we don’t have any support here [in Pakistan]. So we’re kind of struggling.”
The logistics are a high-wire act funded by parental love.
“For every tournament these guys go to, we as parents have to fund it,” she explained. “Flights, lodging, ice time — ice time is very expensive. It takes a toll on families.”

The costs are covered through a patchwork of GoFundMe drives, pooled donations and the kind of communal ingenuity familiar to every immigrant story.
“It’s the Pakistani culture coming together,” she said, and you can almost smell the steam. “It’s biryanis on the table for bachas [kids] and things like that.”
Players don’t stay in hotels. They stay in the homes of other parents, welcomed as sons. They are not just athletes; they are a community’s shared investment, fed on rice and hope.
They have signed formal, five-year contracts binding them to Pakistan — a semi-professional commitment sustained by amateur means, a profound promise made on unstable ground.
A different kind of ice
For Mahd and players like him, hockey has always been a space of cultural dissonance.
“Ice hockey is not a very brown-dominated sport, especially not a Muslim-dominated sport,” he said. “Growing up in Vancouver, there weren’t many Muslim kids playing hockey.”
He is diplomatic but honest.
“It’s not always easy to click with everyone because of cultural differences. Everyone is super nice, but it’s still a different feeling playing with a bunch of white players versus playing with people who come from the same place you came from.”
The Pakistan team is not just a team; it is a homeland on ice. Its chemistry is its most guarded asset.
“We just came from gold, so we’re always looking for new players,” Mahd said. “But we definitely want to keep this chemistry moving forward.”
That sense of identity was tested in Florida in a moment of historical symmetry. For the first time ever, Pakistan faced India — on ice.
“That was the first time India and Pakistan played each other,” Mahd recalled. “It was really cool to see. Everyone was super nice.”
There was respect, not rancour. There was also a glimpse of a path not taken.
“They’re a good team. They’re actually a division higher than us,” he noted. “The Indian community is well-funded. They have a lot of support. India supports its sports better than Pakistan does.”
The observation was not bitter — just clear-eyed.
The new professionals
Mahd is 22. The traditional hockey dream — the NHL — has passed.
“Most people going into the NHL are scouted by 18 or 19,” he said, without self-pity.
“Professional, NHL-level hockey may not be in the cards for me,” he added. “But representing Pakistan on a national stage — and hopefully being inducted into the IIHF — that would be professional.”
His ambition has shifted from personal stardom to national elevation. He studies the hockey map not as a hopeful recruit, but as a strategist.
“In Division Two you have South Korea, China, Spain,” he said. “That’s where we see Pakistan.”
The goal is to host camps in Pakistan’s northern areas — to plant the flag at home.
After the Florida tournament, the world took notice. Instagram reels of their gold-medal run amassed more than two million views.
Mahd was in Europe recently when strangers from Spain recognised him.
“They knew about our team,” he said, smiling. “That was really cool.”
The digital scavenger hunt had come full circle.
The small unit in the stands
Through it all, the parents remain the silent, steadfast chorus.
“The Pakistani community in Vancouver is very small,” Shehla said. “So whoever is there, we’re in the stands. We’re always a very chota [small] unit.”
She described the scene with painful clarity.
“If it’s a Florida team, they have big crowds. We’re always a very small unit.”
Outnumbered, out-spent and out-voiced — but never out-prided.
And for Shehla, the bridge stretches even further back, to Montreal in 1976. Her father’s legacy, once lost to time and silence, now screams back to life in the chill of an ice rink.
“To have a grandson stand there and cheer him on — it’s an honour,” she said. “I can’t tell you how proud I am.”
The lost is found — not preserved, but transformed. From field to ice. From an individual dream deferred to a collective future unfolding.
Her father played for Pakistan that was. Her son plays for the Pakistan that could be.
The foundation
Mahd knows this is only the first shift.
“Of course, this is just the start,” he said. He envisions a five-year horizon. “Eventually, by year five or six, we’ll have a foundation. We won’t need to struggle like this. We can just focus on playing.”
For now, the work is the bond.
“It’s a whole team effort,” he said. “We’re a family.”
A family built on WhatsApp groups and biryani, on GoFundMe pages and gold medals, spanning Vancouver to London, aged 16 to 28.
They are playing for more than promotion. They are playing to turn viral fame into structure, nostalgia into opportunity — to ensure the next wide-eyed Pakistani kid sees not a ghost of a legacy, but a clear path on the ice.
In a Florida arena, a chant began small, born from a small unit in the stands. Fed by the ghosts of Montreal and the hopes of millions, it grew until it shook the glass.
It already lives — in the scrape of a skate, the crack of a puck, and the quiet, overwhelming pride of a mother who finally found the missing photograph not in an album, but in the reflection of the ice, in the eyes of her son.</p><small>2026-02-04 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/042047455a97c15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971002/confident-kazakh-presidents-visit-will-open-avenues-for-shared-prosperity-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Confident Kazakh president’s visit will open avenues for shared prosperity, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that he was confident that the visit of Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev would open “new avenues for shared prosperity”.
He made the remarks on X after President Tokayev spent a busy day in Islamabad, meeting with the Pakistani leadership.
“Delighted to host my dear brother President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in Islamabad on this historic visit — the first by a Kazakh president in 23 years,” PM Shehbaz said.







“We agreed to elevate our relations to a strategic partnership, enhance bilateral trade to $1 billion, deepen regional connectivity, and expand cooperation across economic, defence, energy, and people-to-people domains,” he said.
“We also addressed the Pakistan–Kazakhstan Business Forum, where it was heartening to see business leaders from both nations engaging to create new opportunities across key sectors,” he added.
“I am confident that President Tokayev’s visit will open new avenues for shared prosperity and stronger regional integration. Our two sides will work closely to devise a roadmap to translate our political goodwill into concrete economic outcomes before my visit to Astana,” he concluded.
Both countries aim to increase bilateral trade to $1bn
Earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz vowed to take bilateral trade volume with Kazakhstan to $1 billion over the next year. The remarks came as the two addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad.
A signing ceremony was held at the joint press conference, where the two countries signed 27 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in several sectors, including petroleum, mining, and maritime affairs.







At the outset of his address, PM Shehbaz welcomed the delegation from Kazakhstan, noting that it was the “first time in 23 years that a Kazakh president was visiting the country”.
He stated that the two of them had “very useful and productive meetings since the morning, and just now signed 37 MoUs”.
PM Shehbaz expressed the hope that President Tokayev “will make sure that the MoUs are converted into agreements and then [move] to their implementation phase as early as possible”.
The premier also vowed to ensure “speedy” implementation of the MoUs on his part.
“If we are to make these MoUs a reality, our economic, trade, and cultural relations will go notches higher,” the premier maintained.
He commended President Tokayev for being a “very serious-minded politician [and] an accomplished diplomat”.
He also congratulated the Kazakh premier on receiving the Nishan-i-Pakistan, stressing that the honour reflected Pakistan’s “deep appreciation of your visionary leadership and your outstanding contribution towards strengthening the close and friendly ties between our two brotherly countries”.
The premier then shifted his attention to US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, and congratulated President Tokayev on joining the board.
“Let us pray and hope that we will be successful in bringing long-lasting peace in Gaza, its reconstruction, and of course, make the two-state solution a reality as soon as possible,” PM Shehbaz said.
“Kazakhstan is blessed with infinite natural resources, and you are one of the leading countries in the field of mining minerals and [exporting] them along with petroleum products, oil and gas.
“Pakistan is also blessed with infinite natural resources, great human minds and a very hardworking population,” PM Shehbaz said.
However, he noted that Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s “trade volume was just a meagre $250 million during the last year”.
“This does not just reflect the strength of our friendship but also the potential of our two countries,” he added.
He continued: “Let us make the commitment that we will take up our trade volume to $1 billion in the next year”.
He called on the Pakistani and Kazakh business communities to invest in joint ventures, stressing that the current investment portfolio was “negligible” despite great potential on both sides.
PM Shehbaz detailed that the two sides had agreed to the “Belarus-Russia-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan transport corridor to enhance regional connectivity”.
He assured President Tokayev that Pakistan would offer to Kazakhstan “full access to Pakistan’s transit infrastructure and seaport facilities”.
It is worth mentioning that Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked country. It borders Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
On the matter of energy, the premier expressed faith that the collaboration between the two countries in the sector would be a “win-win situation”.
Shehbaz further stressed that Pakistan regarded Kazakhstan as a “strategic and one of the most valued partners in Central Asia”.
“I am absolutely confident that with our collaboration and discussion today, with productive, encouraging outcomes and this signing ceremony, we will not only reinvigorate our relations but also give a huge impetus to our bilateral ties,” the premier said.
Detailing the meeting between the two, PM Shehbaz said that President Tokayev gave a “wonderful roadmap for our future cooperation”.
“This could only come from a visionary leader like you, who has great experience, great expertise and knowledge,” the prime minister added.
He further stressed that as Pakistan and Kazakhstan’s partnership strengthened, “we look forward to exploring new horizons of cooperation in trade, culture, education and many other areas”.
Pakistan ‘reliable, important partner’
President Tokayev, in his address, termed Pakistan a “reliable and important partner in South Asia and beyond”.
“Our people are united by centuries-old ties rooted in the legacy of the great Silk Road, as well as by deep cultural and spiritual affinity,” he said.
“Our nations share common values, traditions, and joint aspirations for the future,” he added. He detailed that the two countries “signed a historical document — a joint declaration — on establishing a strategic partnership between Pakistan and Kazakhstan”.
“By elevating our relations to a new level, we open up immense opportunities to engage across the full spectrum of bilateral and multilateral agendas,” he added.
President Tokayev lauded PM Shehbaz for “his significant, decisive contribution to deepening friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries“.
He noted that Islamabad’s “regional and global standing continues to grow” under the leadership of PM Shehbaz.
Tokayev lauded Pakistan’s efforts in “strengthening peace and stability in the region,” recalling Pakistan’s election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
“Today, Pakistan possesses strong economic potential, well-developed industrial capacity and extensive transit and transport capabilities,” he added.
He also commended the “dynamic development of Pakistan’s defence industry”, which he said was “well-recognised globally”.
Speaking about his meeting with the prime minister, he said, “We just held very substantive and productive talks with PM Shehbaz”.
“This afternoon, I will also have the privilege of meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari,” he added.
He said that during his meeting with PM Shehbaz, the pair discussed “trade, transport and logistics, industry, energy, information technology, as well as cultural and humanitarian cooperation”.
“Important intergovernmental documents were adopted, focusing on result-oriented engagement across the full bilateral spectrum,” he added.
He also took note of the two countries’ trade ties, which he said were now “gaining new momentum”.
“Last year, bilateral trade doubled compared to the previous year,” he said, adding that the “roadmap for trade and economic cooperation is being effectively implemented”.
Echoing PM Shehbaz’s commitment to expanding bilateral trade ties, he said, “We agreed to take concrete measures to further increase trade volume with an ambitious yet achievable target of reaching $1bn in the near future, emphasising the importance of creating favourable conditions to intensify cooperation between our business communities.”
He added that the transport and logistics project “aimed at expanding trade” would be prioritised.
The Kazakh president stressed that Pakistan’s role in transit and logistics could “offer us alternative access to international markets”.
He said that the two leaders discussed “the capabilities of Pakistan’s ports of Karachi and Gwadar as priority issues”.
The visiting head of state added that the two also addressed the “development of Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor and transit routes passing through Afghanistan”.
The two sides also agreed to “explore the possibility of resuming direct air connection between the two countries”.
Speaking about the energy sector, President Tokayev said that the two “exchanged views on the prospects of Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India TAPI gas pipeline”.
He further said that the two sides had signed agreements in the agriculture sector. He said that the agreements would pave the way for “expanding trade and establishing joint production facilities”.
Taking note of both countries’ “substantial industrial capabilities”, he invited Pakistani companies to set up production facilities in Kazakhstan.
He added that the two also agreed to “expand mutually beneficial cooperation in the defence industry”.
“Cooperation between our security and law enforcement agencies has been developing dynamically in recent years,” President Tokayev noted.
He also said that the two leaders, during their meeting, “emphasised the strategic importance of AI and digital technologies, especially for economic growth, and we confirmed our readiness to walk jointly in this field”.
Tokayev expressed readiness to “provide favourable conditions for Pakistani investors in Kazakhstan”.
“More than 250 companies from both countries will come together and sign a number of commercial agreements,” he said, referring to the Kazakhstan-Pakistan Business Forum.
He expressed confidence that the event would “unlock untapped potential in trade, economic and investment relations”.
He recalled that in his meeting with the prime minister, the two also discussed the “popularity” of Kazakhstan’s higher education among Pakistani youth.
“Currently, more than 1,000 Pakistanis students are studying in Kazakhstan in various fields,” President Tokayev said.
The two sides agreed to “foster cooperation in science and education,” according to President Tokayev.
PM calls for turning friendly ties into business relations
Later, the two also addressed the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum. During his speech, PM Shehbaz expressed that the event would “augur wonderfully well for our future”.
“This morning, we had extensive discussions on how to further enhance our trade in agriculture, IT, minerals and connectivity, which is central to this entire discussion,” the premier said
Noting that many Central Asian countries were landlocked, he pledged to provide expertise and an “outlet” through Gwadar and Karachi.
“The NLC (National Logistics Corporation), which is a state-owned company … is fully geared to transport goods from central Asian countries to our ports, and then, of course, from Karachi and Gwadar to Kazakhstan and other central Asian nations,” PM Shehbaz said.
Hailing this as a great opportunity, the premier said that it was “deeply entrusted” to rapidly develop rail and road links through Turkmenistan and Afghanistan to Chaman.
“Pakistan is fully committed to participating and contributing meaningfully in undertaking this project, as it will be a game-changer,” PM Shehbaz asserted. “Not only between our two countries, but this will change the landscape economically for the entire region.”
The premier continued, addressing President Tokayev: “As we discussed this morning, despite our fraternal relations and deep bonds of friendship, our trade volume, as we speak, hovers around $250 million.
“[This] is not a fair reflection of our brotherly relations, and of course, the infinite potential the two countries have in various walks of industry, agriculture, mining, IT, pharmaceutical, engineering, manufacturing and all other important areas of commerce and trade.”
PM Shehbaz said that he and Tokayev agreed to achieve a trade target of $1bn within the next two years, adding that they would do everything “to achieve the target even earlier”.
The premier added that he accepted an invitation from the Kazakh president to visit his country within this year. He added that both nations agreed to form a working group, which would undertake a five-year programme examining ways to increase commerce, trade and bilateral investment.
“My dear brother President Tokayev accepted this proposal immediately, and from our side we have appointed Dr Ahsan Iqbal as head of our Pakistan side,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin would lead the other.
“This will be a very important decision which will lead to a wonderful five-year roadmap, and hopefully, we will sign this document during my visit to your great country,” the premier added.
“This is the time; we should accept this challenge and convert this very friendly relation into very friendly commercial business relations. Time and tide wait for none, so let’s accept the challenge and move forward.”
PM Shehbaz highlighted one of the 37 MoUs signed during Tokayev’s visit, which revolved around developing the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railroad, as well as cooperation between ports to connect both regions and “optimise our respective transit potential”.
He also noted that Tokayev’s visit was the first time a Kazakh leader had come to Pakistan in 23 years, the last one being former president Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2003.
In his address at the forum, Tokayev regarded his first state visit to Pakistan as a “turning point” in the two nations’ bilateral cooperation.
“We have signed a joint declaration which elevates our partnership to the strategic level,” he said.
The Kazakh president further stated that “today’s business forum has resulted in over 30 agreements with a total value [of] around Rs200m” and expressed the hope that both nations would “be able to talk about billions and billions of dollars” in the next six or seven years.
“Going forward, it will serve as a powerful catalyst for further strengthening trade, economic and investment cooperation between our two brotherly nations,” Tokayev said. “Our partnership has been steadily gaining momentum. Last year, trade turnover between our countries nearly doubled.”
He noted that 200 companies with Pakistani capital, operating in the agriculture, construction, food processing and other fields, were active in Kazakhstan.
“Building on this positive trend, we have now set an ambitious yet an achievable goal of increasing our bilateral trade to $1bn,” Tokayev announced. “To realise this, we have firmly committed to creating favourable conditions for Pakistani companies to do business in Kazakhstan.
The Kazakh president said that he had instructed his government to intensify business-to-business engagement, especially through the Kazakhstan-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission.
“Kazakhstan is committed to providing [a] stable and transparent investment climate, offering Pakistani businesses clear pathways into our market and the broader region,” he said.
Tokayev listed transport and logistics as priority areas of engagement between the countries.
“Kazakhstan and Pakistan both occupy strategically important geographic positions. Both countries serve as key gateways for regional and global connectivity,” he highlighted.
The president noted that one of the main factors in advancing cooperation in trade, economics and investment would be the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan transit corridor.
“Its implementation would represent a breakthrough, fundamentally strengthening regional integration and unlocking new opportunities to trade and investment,” Tokayev explained, welcoming an agreement between Pakistan’s National Logistics Corporation and Kazakhstan’s railways operator.
Touching on agriculture and food security, the Kazakh president highlighted Islamabad and Astana’s membership of the Islamic Organisation for Food Security, adding that both countries shared a commitment to “building sustainable, resilient and equitable food systems for our citizens and the wider Muslim world”.
“As we grow as a reliable producer of high-quality and environmentally sustainable agricultural goods, we are taking consistent steps to expand our partnerships and build new supply chains regionally and globally,” Tokayev stated, welcoming Pakistan’s knowledge and capital in the sector.
“The signing of an agreement with the Almaas Group to launch a sugar beet processing plant … marks a significant step in our cooperation, establishing formal relations with both the Fauji Foundation and the Ignite National Technological Fund would be very beneficial to identifying new joint investment projects,” he added.
Moving on to digitalisation, Tokayev said it would be a “key driver” of future trade and investment cooperation. He commended Pakistan’s steps toward digitalisation, such as the introduction of digital solutions for e-governance, connectivity, skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has consistently emphasised the vital role of digital transformation in ensuring the future competitiveness of the Pakistani economy,” the Kazakh president said.
“Kazakhstan shares this forward-looking vision and is convinced of the transformative potential of digital innovation for both our nations,” he added, noting that Astana’s goal was to become a “fully digital nation” within the next few years.
“To achieve this, we have established a Ministry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Development — the first of its kind in our region,” Tokayev said.
In addition, Kazakhstan had created an international centre for AI to serve as a hub for research, innovation and technological enhancement, he said.
“Kazakhstan’s inDrive IT platform is well represented across Pakistan. As of 2025, it accounts for more than 60 per cent of the Pakistani taxi services market and is the number one app for city travel,” he said.
He invited Pakistani partners to leverage Kazakhstan’s IT and investment frameworks as a gateway to tap Kazakh and regional markets.
In terms of education, Tokayev said his country was taking steps to expand its role as a hub for research and innovation, adding that Kazakhstan had forged partnerships with 40 leading universities across the globe.
“During this visit, we have also established formal relations between some of our leading research and education institutions,” he said, expressing gratitude to PM Shehbaz for opening three cultural and academic centres at Pakistani universities.
“I am confident that our joint efforts in education, research and knowledge-sharing will keep serving the best interests of our nations.”
Stating that the partnership between both nations “stands at a pivotal moment”, the Kazakh president identified significant opportunities to broaden and deepen engagement across the full spectrum of the bilateral economic agenda.
“It is essential that we work together to strengthen cooperation, create shared benefits for our businesses and ultimately deliver prosperity for our citizens,” he said.
Joint declaration on strategic partnership
Meanwhile, Pakistan and Kazakhstan also issued a joint declaration in which they agreed to establish a strategic partnership for the mutual benefit of the two countries.
The key areas of cooperation included: political dialogue; security and defence; trade, economy and investment; transport and logistics; education, science and information technology; culture, media, sports and tourism; climate change and environmental coordination; and cooperation at the regional and international level.







“Both the leaders welcomed the growing understanding and partnership between the two countries in various fields, inter alia, political, security, defence, trade, economy, agriculture, transportation, logistics, education, culture, sports, and tourism, as well as deepening of interaction between the two sides in regional and international arenas,” the statement said.
“The leaders reaffirmed that further strengthening cooperation between the two countries, in accordance with the United Nations charter and based on respect for independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and universally accepted principles and norms of international law, will not only consolidate and expand their bilateral partnership, but would also positively contribute to the peace, security, connectivity, and stability of the entire region of Central and South Asia and beyond,” it added.
Kazakh president awarded Nishan-i-Pakistan
Later, President Zardari awarded the Kazakh president the Nishan-i-Pakistan at a special ceremony in Islamabad, according to a handout by the President’s Secretariat. PM Shehbaz was also present at the occasion
According to the statement, during a meeting between the president and the visiting dignitary, the former said the two countries shared a firm commitment to broadening cooperation across political, economic and regional domains, while “affirming Pakistan’s readiness to work closely with the country to advance shared goals of peace, connectivity and sustainable development”.







The statement said that the two presidents exchanged views on key bilateral, regional and international issues, which was followed by an extended meeting with their respective delegations.
“Highlighting economic engagement, the president observed that while bilateral trade had registered growth in recent years, it remains well below its true potential,” it said.
He also expressed confidence that the Roadmap for Trade and Economic Cooperation 2025–2027, together with agreements on transit trade, customs cooperation and banking, would help remove operational bottlenecks and open new avenues for trade, investment and business-to-business collaboration, the statement said.
President Zardari also underscored the importance of leveraging Pakistan’s facilities and frameworks in areas such as energy, agriculture, mining, information technology and defence production.
“Exchanging views on regional and international developments, President Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to peace, dialogue and respect for international law,” it said.
It added that he also stressed the need for collective efforts to promote stability in South Asia and the broader region and emphasised that regional challenges should be addressed through cooperation rather than confrontation.
For his part, President Tokayev said that Kazakhstan attached great importance to its relations with Pakistan and regarded the partnership as a key pillar of regional cooperation. He expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and reaffirmed Kazakhstan’s commitment to working closely with Pakistan to strengthen connectivity, expand economic cooperation and promote peace and stability in the region, the statement said.
“The two leaders expressed confidence that the visit would open a new chapter in Pakistan–Kazakhstan relations and agreed to maintain close coordination to advance shared goals of connectivity, economic cooperation and regional stability,” it added.
Tokayev welcomed
Earlier, PM Shehbaz warmly welcomed President Tokayev at his official residence. President Tokayev was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned out contingent of the armed forces following his arrival.







The Kazakh president arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday for a two-day official visit as the two nations seek to further bolster bilateral ties.
The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
Tokayev is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials. A video shared by his office showed the streets in Islamabad adorned with Kazakhstan’s national flag.
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with President Tokayev and welcomed him to Pakistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
During the meeting, Dar “underscored Pakistan’s appreciation for the growing momentum of high-level political exchanges.”
The foreign minister “reaffirmed the shared commitment to expand bilateral cooperation across political, economic, & people-to-people domains, and to work together for durable peace, stability, and development in the region,” FO said.







Agreement to deepen trade, connectivity and investment cooperation
Separately, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan held a comprehensive bilateral meeting with Kazakhstan’s Minister of Trade and Integration Arman Shaqqaliev, at the Ministry of Commerce in Islamabad on Wednesday.
The two sides explored avenues for expanding economic cooperation, connectivity and investment, according to a press release.
“Both sides agreed that improved rail, road and multimodal connectivity is fundamental to strengthening Pakistan–Kazakhstan trade and enabling sustainable, long-term economic engagement,” the statement said.
The Kazakh minister highlighted the strategic importance of developing major infrastructure projects, particularly railway and road corridors. He emphasised Kazakhstan’s vision of becoming a regional hub connecting Central Asia with South Asia, China, Europe and the Global South, including Pakistan’s ports, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Jam Kamal Khan said that improved transit routes would not only benefit Pakistan and Kazakhstan but also open broader opportunities for regional and global trade.
“Both ministers discussed cooperation in priority sectors, including agriculture and food security, pharmaceuticals, textiles, sports goods, leather products, mining and minerals, energy, and infrastructure development,” the statement said.
The meeting also reviewed the need for structured business-to-business (B2B) engagement. It was agreed to work towards finalising a framework document outlining priority sectors, trade targets and a roadmap of activities, including trade missions, exhibitions and exchange of delegations.
“Both ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to transforming Pakistan–Kazakhstan economic relations from potential to performance,” the statement added.
They expressed confidence that sustained institutional coordination and private-sector engagement would significantly enhance bilateral trade and investment in the coming years.
‘Important and timely opportunity’
In a handout issued earlier on Tuesday, the President’s Secretariat said that President Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country sometime this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to hold meetings with President Zardari and PM Shehbaz, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.
This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><small>2026-02-04 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041833191409a92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971036/single-member-judicial-commission-formed-to-probe-cause-of-deadly-gul-plaza-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Single-member judicial commission formed to probe cause of deadly Gul Plaza fire</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh government on Wednesday formed a single-member judicial commission to probe the cause of the Gul Plaza blaze that claimed at least 73 lives.
The notification appointing Justice Agha Faisal and listing the commission’s terms of reference came hours after Sindh High Court (SHC) Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput nominated the judge for the task.
It should be mentioned that the Sindh government had announced it would approach the SHC chief justice for a judicial inquiry into the fire, which took nearly two days to be fully extinguished and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
Earlier in the day, a letter from the SHC registrar to the Sindh Home Department’s secretary, available with Dawn, stated that the chief justice had nominated Justice Faisal as the single-member commission to “probe the causes of the fire incident of Gul Plaza shopping centre, Karachi for a period to be fixed and notified by the government of Sindh”.
It stated that the decision was made keeping in view the provisions of Section 3 of the Sindh Tribunals of Inquiry Ordinance, 1969 and considering the Sindh government’s request, along with the terms of reference (ToR) which had been sought on January 30.
Subsequently, the Sindh Home Department issued a notification stating that Justice Faisal was officially appointed to probe the Gul Plaza incident as a single-member commission of inquiry.
The notification — seen by Dawn — also outlined the commission’s terms of reference.
According to the guidelines outlined, Justice Faisal was tasked with examining if building approvals and lease extensions from the Sindh Building Control Authority, its predecessor organisations and the Karachi Municipal Corporation were granted in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.
The SHC was also expected to “assess if the construction of Gul Plaza was in violation of the approved building plan, leading to difficulty in evacuation of people”, the notification said.
Further, the commission would also have to probe whether arrangements at the building for fire detection, prevention and firefighting would also be assessed, to determine whether building management ensured them, as required under applicable laws and safety regulations.
He would also assess if building management or any government department had carried out fire safety audits, and whether the recommendations were implemented.
Further, he would have to ascertain “the causes and circumstances leading to the fire incident at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre” and “examine and evaluate rescue operations for adequacy and swiftness”.
The commission was also mandated to “fix responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the incident”.
The notification added that Justice Faisal would submit his findings within eight weeks, directing the Karachi Commissioner’s office to provide him with secretariat support.

 

The SHC on Friday had already turned down Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori’s request to constitute a judicial commission to probe the inferno, citing non-compliance with the relevant law and case law “in letter and spirit”.
On January 29, the Sindh government wrote to Justice Rajput, requesting him to nominate a sitting judge to lead an inquiry to ascertain responsibility and examine any failures in regulatory oversight linked to the Gul Plaza incident.
The Chief Minister’s House also urged the SHC registrar to process the request promptly, stating that “an early response is solicited”.
The move came after a cabinet subcommittee of the PPP-led Sindh government reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team. They discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
Though the decision followed Sindh’s major opposition parties’ unanimous rejection of the preliminary findings, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon refuted that it was due to “pressure” from the political opponents.
After conducting its own probe, the Sindh government had said multiple officials were suspended and some would face departmental action.

 

These included the chief engineer (bulk) and the hydrants’ incharge of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC); Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi and its municipal service senior director; and the Civil Defence director and its South district additional controller.
Memon had particularly noted that there was a “delay in the supply of water to the fire tenders”, affecting the operations of KMC’s fire brigade and Rescue 1122.
In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.</p><small>2026-02-04 16:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04190723f67aaa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971040/naqvi-hopes-fia-will-emerge-as-model-institution-under-new-dg-usman-anwars-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>Naqvi hopes FIA will emerge as ‘model institution’ under new DG Usman Anwar’s leadership</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met the newly-appointed Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director General (DG) Dr Usman Anwar on Wednesday and expressed hope that under his leadership, the FIA would emerge as a “model institution”.
The meeting took place during Naqvi’s visit to FIA Headquarters in Islamabad, a statement by the interior ministry said.
It further quoted Naqvi as saying that Anwar would “utilise all his energies and capabilities to transform the agency into an institution that meets public expectations”.
The interior minister added that he would fully support efforts to make the FIA a “modern, strong, and effective organisation”.
The statement quoted DG Anwar as saying that the agency would be improved to meet international standards through the use of modern technology and training.
“All necessary measures will be taken to improve the institution,” he assured.
According to the statement, Naqvi also assessed an under-construction committee room at the FIA Headquarters, and it was also decided during the visit that the headquarter’s building would be reconstructed and renovated in line with modern requirements.
The National Police Academy commandant, National Cybercrime Investigation Agency DG, Islamabad inspector general of police and senior officers of the FIA were also present on the occasion, the statement said.
Anwar, who previously served as the Punjab police chief, was appointed as the FIA DG after he was replaced by Rao Abdul Kareem on Tuesday.
An official earlier claimed while speaking to Dawn that a senior federal minister had supported Anwar’s posting to the FIA, arguing that his past experience in the agency would be relevant for handling high-profile assignments.
Following Anwar’s appointment as the FIA DG, Naqvi had said in a post on X that “with his (Anwar’s) vision and dynamism, the public will witness real, visible change in the coming months”.</p><small>2026-02-04 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04174805b5a5023.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971038/un-experts-slam-imaan-hadis-convictions-say-exercising-freedom-of-expression-should-never-be-conflated-with-criminal-conduct' target='_blank'><strong>UN experts slam Imaan, Hadi’s convictions; say exercising freedom of expression should never be conflated with criminal conduct</strong></a><br><p>Five United Nations (UN) experts on Wednesday expressed alarm over the conviction of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatta.
Last month, an Islamabad sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
In a joint statement on Wednesday, UN special rapporteurs Margaret Satterthwaite, Ben Saul, Mary Lawlor, Irene Khan and Gina Romero noted that the two were convicted on multiple criminal charges, which resulted in lengthy prison sentences “for simply exercising rights guaranteed by international human rights law”.
“Lawyers, like other individuals, are entitled to freedom of expression. The exercise of this right should never be conflated with criminal conduct, especially not terrorism,” they were quoted as saying, while also emphasising the vague definition of terrorism-related offences under Pakistan’s counter-terrorism framework.
“Doing so risks undermining and criminalising the work of lawyers and human rights defenders across Pakistan and has a chilling effect on civil society in the country,” the experts said.







According to the statement, the experts observed that these were not the first prosecutions against the two lawyers, “who have been the subject of 10 criminal complaints since 2022, some of which remain pending” but were never previously convicted of wrongdoing.
“This pattern of prosecutions suggests an arbitrary use of the legal system as an instrument of harassment and intimidation in order to punish them for their work advocating for victims of alleged human rights violations,” they said.
“States must ensure lawyers are not subject to prosecution for any professional action, and that lawyers are not identified with their clients,” the UN experts said.
“International standards provide a set of procedural guarantees that must be made available to persons charged with a criminal offence, but these appear to have been undermined in this case,” the experts said.
“These violations seriously threaten the fairness of the trial and conviction,” they added.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to report their findings. They do not speak in the name of the United Nations itself.
According to the statement, the UN experts “have contacted Pakistan regarding their concerns”.
On January 29, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and its partner organisations had published a joint statement condemning the “arbitrary arrest” and conviction of the two lawyers and called for their release.
Separately, the United Nations Human Rights Office also said that the conviction and sentencing of the couple “following fair trial concerns” was deeply disturbing”.







The European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni had also raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi. The EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”.
“These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said.

Trump on Monday cut US tariffs on Indian goods in a trade deal he said also included provisions for India to halt oil imports from Russia, the world’s second-biggest oil exporter. The US is also putting pressure on Russia to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine.
Trump has over the past year already claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil.
India never halted imports, however, citing its need for energy security and for cheap oil.
The Kremlin says energy cooperation with India, its second-largest oil buyer after China, is strong after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the country in December 2025.
But Indian refiners are taking a cautious approach to Russian oil purchases, which is already hurting Moscow’s income.
Russian oil imports dropped 22 per cent to 1.38 million barrels per day (bpd) in December from November, their lowest since January 2023, reducing Russia’s share in Indian imports to 27.4pc while Opec’s share rose to 53.2pc, according to Reuters’ calculations.
That follows a peak in India’s Russian oil imports at around 2m bpd in June 2025.
“Any further reduction would already be meaningful, because there is only one relevant alternative buyer — China — which has also its limitations in taking in sanctioned crude,” said David Wech from Vortexa consultancy.
The pressure on Russia is increasing as oil discounts widen and fewer buyers are willing to take the risk, Wech said.
Prices for Russian oil have sunk to record lows, while Russia’s budget shows a deficit due to a shortfall in energy revenues, according to a government official.
Adding to the problems, the number of tankers with Russian oil at anchor has increased as companies struggle to sell oil.
Flows to drop further in April
If India stopped buying Russian oil, Moscow would have to try to re-route it to China at cheaper prices, which would take time, and cut production and exports, said Igor Yushkov, an analyst at Russia’s government-run Financial University.
“Output and export cuts would lead to an oil shortage. Hence, we are not seeing a full US ban on Russian oil imports — they would suffer themselves from higher oil prices,” said Yushkov.
Russian oil exports and production have stayed largely resilient in the face of some 30,000 Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine since 2014.

 

Moscow has managed to redirect oil flows away from Europe to China, India and Turkiye. Like India, Turkiye has also cut purchases in recent months amid tougher Western sanctions.
Russia’s total oil exports stood at 4.91m bpd in December, with China being the largest buyer of 2.3m bpd of crude, according to the International Energy Agency.
India’s government has given no instructions to refiners to stop buying Russian oil, and they would need a wind-down period to complete purchases already in place for March, sources said.
India will cut Russian imports in April when one of its top refiners, Russian-backed Nayara, carries out a one-month maintenance at its 400,000 bpd plant, a trader in Russian oil said.
Volumes beyond April will be decided by Russia-Ukraine peace talks and the Indian government’s broader stance, traders said.
Trump said India could buy more US and Venezuelan oil to replace Russian purchases.
US crude cannot replace Russian oil on a like-for-like basis due to quality differences, while Venezuela’s exports are small, said Alexandra Hermann, Economist at Oxford Economics.
Crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq are more likely candidates to substitute Russian oil, said Yushkov. But deep discounts may still make Russian crude difficult to resist for Indian buyers, he added.</p><small>2026-02-04 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0416403745b428f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031/saim-ayub-claims-top-spot-in-icc-t20-all-rounder-rankings-after-excellent-showings-against-australia' target='_blank'><strong>Saim Ayub claims top spot in ICC T20 all-rounder rankings after ‘excellent showings’ against Australia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Saim Ayub has reclaimed the top spot in the ICC Men’s T20 All-Rounder Rankings on the back of “some excellent showings” during the recently concluded three-match series against Australia.
Pakistan whitewashed Australia with a 3-0 victory in the series, during which Saim scored 119 run and claimed three wickets.
An announcement by the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday that Saim moved up one slot to regain the top spot in the monthly rankings, replacing Zimbabwe veteran Sikandar Raza.
The cricket’s governing body said the development “bodes well for Ayub and Pakistan just days out from the start of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup as the Asian side look to claim their second title in the 20-over showcase event and their first since they tasted success in the second edition of the tournament back in 2009”.
Meanwhile, Pakistani spinner Abrar Ahmed also moved up two places to the second spot in the T20 bowler rankings. He grabbed six wickets in the series against Australia and was “now just 28 rating points behind no.1 ranked Varun Chakravarthy of India following six wickets across three matches against the Aussies”, the ICC announcement said.
Fellow spinner Mohammad Nawaz also leaped eight slots to claim the the seventh position on the list following his five-wicket haul in the last match of the series against Australia.
Nawaz also moved up one spot to the fourth position in the T20 all-rounder rankings.
As for the batsman rankings for the shortest format of the game, Saim moved up eight places to the 27th position and Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha leaped 12 slots to claim the 29th position on the list.</p><small>2026-02-04 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041709515961975.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971035/us-iran-nuclear-talks-to-take-place-in-oman-two-sides-to-seek-de-escalation-regional-official' target='_blank'><strong>US-Iran nuclear talks to take place in Oman, two sides to seek de-escalation: regional official</strong></a><br><p>The US and Iran are due to hold talks in Oman on Friday after Tehran requested a change of venue to limit negotiations to its nuclear programme, a regional official said, with a build-up of US forces in the Middle East raising fears of a confrontation.
Iran wanted the meeting to take place in Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme, asking for a change of location from Turkiye to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran’s ballistic missiles, the regional official said.
Iran has said it will not make concessions on its formidable ballistic missile programme — one of the biggest in the Middle East — calling that a red line in negotiations.
Tehran, which said it replenished its stockpile of ballistic missiles since coming under attack from Israel last year, had warned that it will unleash its missiles to defend the Islamic Republic if its security is under threat.
The regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran had since the beginning stressed that it would only discuss its nuclear programme, while Washington wanted other issues on the agenda.
Oil prices extended gains on Wednesday after the US shot down an Iranian drone and armed Iranian boats approached a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, rekindling fears of an escalation between Washington and Tehran.
Iran sought bilateral talks
Trump has warned that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of a wider war.
On Tuesday, the US military shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said.
Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.”
He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected talks to take place.
A source familiar with the situation said Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran wanted only bilateral talks with the US.
In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign.
More recently, the US navy built up forces in the region following Iran’s violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest since Iran’s 1979 revolution.
Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran, sending a flotilla to its coast.
The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters earlier.
Tanker incident
Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and an end to its support for regional proxies.
Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.
Since the US strikes in June, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work — which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes — has stopped.
In another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, the US Central Command said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had approached a US-flagged tanker at speed and threatened to board and seize it.
Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.</p><small>2026-02-04 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041733383cf4dd4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971037/in-meeting-with-nawaz-and-maryam-iranian-envoy-appreciates-pakistans-continued-support-toward-iran' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Nawaz and Maryam, Iranian envoy appreciates Pakistan’s ‘continued support’ toward Iran</strong></a><br><p>In a meeting with PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam appreciated Islamabad’s “principled positions and continued support” toward his country in various areas.
“Highly honored to call on Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, president of the PML-N, and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Mogahadam said in a post on X about the meeting.







He added: “Reiterating the firm commitment of the Islamic Republic of Iran to further enhance Iran-Pakistan relations, I expressed my sincere appreciation for the principled positions and continued support of the government of Pakistan toward Iran in various arenas.”
The envoy said he had met the father-daughter duo to exchange views on the latest regional developments, “particularly in light of recent interventions by the United States and the Israeli regime, including their interventionist positions, threats, and escalatory rhetoric”.
“We also discussed initiatives aimed at further strengthening the bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan,” he said.
Moghadam also acknowledged during the meeting the “tireless endeavors” of Pakistan’s government, particularly Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, in their efforts to further promote comprehensive and all-round cooperation between the two nations.
“While stressing Iran’s full readiness to defend itself against any imminent adventurism, I underlined the steadfast determination of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue fair, equitable, and constructive negotiations aimed at resolving outstanding issues through dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international norms,” the envoy further stated.
Moghadam added he emphasised that Iran and Pakistan were “like two bodies and one soul, and that both nations have consistently demonstrated their love, commitment, and brotherhood throughout history and the test of time”.
According to the Iranian envoy, Nawaz expressed concern regarding recent developments and imminent threats while referring to the close monitoring and continuous follow-up of developments in Iran and the region.
“He emphasised the importance of constructive negotiations based on mutual respect and equality, within the framework of international law and good faith, in accordance with the United Nations charter,” he said.
“He noted that dialogue and diplomacy, alongside the protection of national sovereignty and the rejection of any threat or use of force, constitute the path toward ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity throughout this already volatile region,” Moghadam said about Nawaz.
Separately, the PML-N also posted about the meeting on X, saying bilateral ties, trade, energy and the regional situation were discussed during the meeting, and the leaders from both sides “reiterated their commitment to strengthen Pak-Iran relations”.
The party’s statement said that Maryam invited Iranian investment in the areas of agriculture, IT and tourism during the exchange and reaffirmed her commitment to advancing economic and social ties between the two countries.
“The Iranian ambassador expressed gratitude toward PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Dar for their support,” the statement said.
It quoted Nawaz as saying: “If the door to talks is kept open, even the biggest of issues can be resolved through negotiations. Iran has faced the situation with immense courage.”
The PML-N supremo extended prayers and good wishes toward Iran and its people.
The party’s statement also quoted Amiri as saying that Muslim world “needed a great leader like Nawaz”. According to the statement, he also underlined the importance of Nawaz’s potential role in promoting Pak-Iran ties.
The meeting has taken place amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US, with a build-up of US forces in the Middle East raising fears of a confrontation.
Against this backdrop, Tehran and Washington are to hold negotiations in Oman on Friday, and Pakistan has also been invited to participate in the talks.
Reuters quoted a regional official as saying that Iran wanted the venue to be changed from the initially planned Turkiye to Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme and to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran’s ballistic missiles.</p><small>2026-02-04 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04142229cbfdaf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971023/mobile-internet-remains-suspended-in-parts-of-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Mobile internet remains suspended in parts of Balochistan for the fifth consecutive day, with provincial authorities also halting train services in the province in the wake of last week’s coordinated terrorist attacks across the province.
“Keeping in mind the worsening law and order situation in the province, mobile internet has been shut down,” said Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat while speaking to Dawn about the situation in Quetta.
However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.”
Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki and Sibi, as well as in Mastung where services were briefly restored.
Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns.
Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended.
He added that “once the security situation improves and we receive clearance, services of the Jaffar Express (Quetta-Peshawar) and the Bolan Mail (Quetta-Karachi) will be restored”.
On Tuesday, security forces continued ‘mop-up actions’ in Nushki district and other parts of the province following the coordinated attacks, with the number of terrorists killed now at 197.
In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and a Federal Constabulary (FC) camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire.
But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-04 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0410593969ff18d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971005/bulls-sustain-rally-as-kse-100-rises-over-900-points' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls sustain rally as KSE-100 rises over 900 points</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the green at 187,832.08 points on Wednesday.

Clarke and Isaac Asimov.
Elon Musk’s mega-merger of his companies xAI and SpaceX this week brings this sci-fi dream a step closer.
Nasa engineers and technologists have speculated for nearly two decades about moving energy-hungry computing off the planet.
More recently, the idea has captured the attention of Big Tech, including Alphabet and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. The physics made sense; the solar energy was abundant. Still, the challenges seemed insurmountable.

 

Musk, though, known for betting on seemingly far-out theories and getting them to work, may finally be laying the groundwork to make data centres in space a reality.
He is armed with the world’s busiest satellite launch fleet, an AI startup, and an appetite for infrastructure that stretches from Earth to vacuum.
“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk said on Monday.
“To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilisation currently uses! The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.”
The merger sharpens investor focus on how he might overcome big hurdles through a tightly woven ecosystem of rockets, satellites and AI systems, to take AI infrastructure beyond Earth.
It comes just as SpaceX is preparing for a potential $1.5 trillion initial public offering (IPO). SpaceX has sought permission to launch up to 1 million solar-powered satellites engineered as orbital data centres, far beyond anything currently deployed or proposed.

 

In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX describes a solar-powered, optical-link-driven orbital data-centre system, though it did not say how many Starship launches would be required to scale the space data-centre network to an operational degree.
“Compute in space isn’t sci-fi anymore,” said David Ariosto, author and founder of space intelligence firm The Space Agency.
“And Elon Musk has already proven himself capable across multiple domains.”
Old idea meets new economics
Advocates argue that space-based data centres would be a cheaper alternative to data centres on Earth, thanks to constant solar energy and the ability to dump heat directly into space.
But some experts have warned that big commercial gains are years from reality as the concept faces daunting challenges and is fraught with technical risks: radiation, debris, heat management, latency, and formidable economics that include high maintenance costs.
“There’s some real challenges here, and how do you then make that cost-effective?” said Armand Musey, founder of Summit Ridge Group, who said the financial details of a project such as this was hard to model because the “technical unknowns haven’t been clarified.”
“But never say never,” said Musey, who called Musk’s track record “unbelievable”. “I think a large part of it is, it’s a bet on Elon. His success is really hard for people to ignore.”

 

Even with Musk’s ambitions, data centres in space may not be achievable for another decade, some experts have said.
The underlying physics behind space-based infrastructure is not new.
Harnessing solar power in orbit dates back to Cold War-era research, when the US Department of Energy and Nasa studied space-based solar power concepts in the 1970s, ultimately concluding that launch and materials costs made them impractical.
What makes Musk’s efforts different is that his companies have more direct control over key elements of the system — from the rockets that will carry the hardware, to the links to beam data back to Earth, to a Musk-owned social network to generate demand for cheap AI computing.
“SpaceX has structural advantages that few others can match. It controls the world’s most active launch fleet, has demonstrated mass production of spacecraft through Starlink, and has access to substantial private capital,” said Kathleen Curlee, a research analyst at Georgetown University.
Bombarding chips with radiation
Among the biggest challenges facing space data centres are radiation and cooling.
Data-centre hardware will be bombarded by cosmic rays from the sun. In the past, chips designed for space were specially “hardened” for such radiation but were rarely as fast as today’s flagship AI chips.
Cooling AI chips, which generate immense heat during computations, is the other hurdle. While space is cold, it is also a near vacuum, so heat cannot be carried away the way it is on Earth. Powerful chips must instead move heat into large radiators that shed it as infrared energy, adding significant size, weight, and therefore cost.

 

SpaceX’s filing with the FCC describes cooling via “passive heat dissipation into the vacuum of space” and outlines how satellites that suffer operational failures rapidly de-orbit.
More recently, Alphabet’s Google bombarded one of its AI chips with radiation at a university lab in California to see how it would endure a five- or six-year mission in space for a research effort to network solar-powered satellites into an orbital AI cloud called Project Suncatcher.
“They held up quite well against that,” said Travis Beals, a senior executive at Google and lead of the project, which is set for a prototype launch to space in 2027.

Among the dead was a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis and was then killed by a second attack on the same location, health officials said.
Other strikes hit Gaza City in the north, where health officials said a five-month-old boy was killed. The attacks come three days after Israel reopened Gaza’s main border crossing with Egypt, a major step in the US-backed truce.
The Israeli military claimed it had launched the strikes in response to gunmen opening fire against Israeli troops operating near its armistice line with Hamas. It said an Israeli soldier was severely injured by the fire.
Wednesday’s attacks bring the number of Palestinians killed since the border reopened to 28, according to a tally from Gazan health officials.
On Saturday, before its reopening, Israeli strikes killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. The military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in a Gaza area under Israeli control.
Patient crossings at Rafah halted
Palestinian patients preparing to cross through the newly opened Rafah border crossing to Egypt were told that Israel had postponed the passage of patients through the border.
A few hours later, the patients were told to prepare again to cross the border.
A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.
“They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed,” Raja’a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.
An Egyptian security source told Reuters that efforts were being made to reopen the crossing, and that Israel had cited security issues in the Rafah area as the reason for the closure.
The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, claimed in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, adding that it had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the crossing.
The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.







Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters.
A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday.

 

In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire, where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave’s future governance and reconstruction.
Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from over 50 per cent of Gaza, which they currently occupy, and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.
Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian fighters have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
The Oct 7, 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the offensive killed around 1,200 in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</p><small>2026-02-04 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04151121bc0fbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971014/punjab-government-notifies-public-holidays-on-feb-6-7-for-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab government notifies public holidays on Feb 6, 7 for Basant</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government has notified public holidays in the province on February 6 and 7 (Friday and Saturday) for Basant, said a notification.
The notification was issued on Tuesday by the provincial government’s Services and General Administration Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“It is hereby notified for general information that 6th and 7th February, 2026 (Friday and Saturday) shall be observed as public holidays in the province of Punjab,” the notification said.







On Sunday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a Basant holiday.
“Punjab will enjoy a long weekend with Kashmir Day on February 5, a provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday.
“We hope people across Punjab take this time to relax, recharge, and make the most of the break,” she posted on X.







The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival.
“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
However, it is set to make a grand return after a hiatus of 18 years, after the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying in December and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041133157cb09e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971010/police-constable-martyred-by-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police constable martyred by terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>Terrorists martyred a police recruit constable in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the local police said on Wednesday.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. KP and Balochistan are particularly frequent targets.
The constable was killed in the Darga forest in Nasrkhel, near the Sarai Naurang area of ​​Lakki Marwat.
District Police Spokesperson Qudratullah confirmed the incident, saying that the martyred constable had been undergoing training at Hangu Training School.
“On Tuesday night, terrorists abducted him from his house in Nasrkhel and took him to a forest called Darga and shot and killed him there,” he said.
The funeral prayers of the constable were offered with official honours at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines. Lakki Marwat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigation Murad Khan, police officers, district administration officers and police personnel attended the prayers in large numbers.
The DPO also paid tribute to the martyr’s sacrifice, saying that the constable had set “a shining example of bravery and sacrifice” by giving his life in the line of duty.
“The entire nation is proud of this brave soldier. These cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken our resolve,” he said.
“The morale of Lakki Marwat police is high and actions against Fitna-al-Khawarij will be further intensified. No sacrifice will be spared to protect the lives and property of the people, and the involved elements will be brought to their logical end soon.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Despite record militant deaths, the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
Last month, the KP Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan.
Only days before that, at least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts, officials said.
The previous week, the military’s media wing had said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. That same day, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu.</p><small>2026-02-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04140135f152767.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971016/chaudhry-sugar-mills-case-lhc-directs-nab-to-approach-trial-court-for-closing-inquiry-against-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Chaudhry Sugar Mills case: LHC directs NAB to approach trial court for closing inquiry against Maryam</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to move the trial court concerned after the anti-graft body decided to close the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry against Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
The case pertains to alleged money laundering and income beyond means via “dubious” business transactions of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills, of which Maryam was a major shareholder.
A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and including Justices Muhammad Jawad Zafar and Abher Gul Khan, heard CM Maryam’s civil miscellaneous application seeking the refund of Rs70 million deposited as a guarantee in the case.
During the proceedings, the NAB’s prosecutor informed the bench that following the new amendments, the bureau’s chairman had approved the closure of the probe.
Justice Neelum, however, observed that the NAB should have approached the accountability court concerned for closure of the inquiry.
Questioning the investigation process, the chief justice asked the bureau’s counsel to explain the procedure adopted in the case.
In response, the prosecutor stated that the NAB board had decided in a meeting to close the inquiry.
The prosecutor answered the bench in the affirmative when asked whether a new NAB board could reopen the case in the future.
At this, the bench remarked that such a situation would render the NAB board’s decision to close a case meaningless.
Justice Neelum observed, “If the court orders the release of the bail surety amount today and the case is reopened tomorrow, all blame would fall on the court.”
Subsequently, the bench directed the NAB to approach the relevant accountability court within one month for the formal closure of the Chaudhry Sugar Mills inquiry.
A NAB team had arrested Maryam in connection with the case on Aug 8, 2019 when she was present at the Kot Lakhpat jail on her weekly visit to her incarcerated father Nawaz.
On Nov 4, 2019, the LHC released Maryam in the sugar mills case on bail, subject to surrendering her passport to the court. She was also ordered to deposit a surety amount of Rs70m with the registrar judicial of the court.
In October 2022, the LHC directed officials to return the passport to Maryam after the NAB said it did not require the travel document anymore.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041259558396b5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971015/un-security-council-condemns-heinous-and-cowardly-acts-of-terrorism-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous and cowardly acts’ of terrorism in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”.







The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks.
The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”.
It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions.
The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”.
It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.
Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism.
“We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said.
The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province.
The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.</p><small>2026-02-04 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/041324269c40a0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970999/us-india-discuss-critical-minerals-cooperation-and-strategic-ties-during-washington-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>US, India discuss critical minerals cooperation and strategic ties during Washington meeting</strong></a><br><p>The United States and India have held high-level talks in Washington focused on critical minerals cooperation, trade and strategic ties.
The talks were held late on Tuesday against the backdrop of a recently finalised bilateral trade deal that has drawn attention across the region.
Diplomatic observers in Washington, however, maintain that the agreement is unlikely to affect recently improved bilateral ties between Pakistan and the US, as those are not linked to India.
The observers note that recent developments in the greater Middle East, as well as in South and Central Asia, have further enhanced Pakistan’s relevance as a key regional player in Washington’s strategic calculus.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during the latter’s three-day official visit to the United States, as both sides moved to deepen economic and strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific.
According to the US State Department readout, Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar discussed “formalising bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration, mining, and processing”, an area of growing importance amid global supply chain realignments and competition over energy transition resources.
The meeting came ahead of the inaugural critical minerals ministerial scheduled for Wednesday and followed the conclusion of a long-pending trade agreement between Washington and New Delhi. Under the deal, the US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent after nearly a year of negotiations.
“Secretary Rubio and Minister Jaishankar welcomed the trade deal reached between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi,” the US statement said, adding that the two leaders “emphasised the importance of our democracies working together to unlock new economic opportunities and advance our shared energy security goals”.
In a post on social media, Secretary Rubio said: “Met Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar to discuss our bilateral cooperation on critical minerals exploration and work together to unlock new economic opportunities between our two countries. We also commended the trade deal between the United States and India.”







Jaishankar, in his own message, said he was “delighted to meet US Secretary Rubio this afternoon”, describing it as “a wide-ranging conversation that covered our bilateral cooperation agenda, regional and global issues”.
“Facets of India — US Strategic Partnership discussed included trade, energy, nuclear, defence, critical minerals and technology,” he said, adding: “Agreed on the early meetings of various mechanisms to advance our shared interests.”







The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to expanding “bilateral and multilateral cooperation” through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which brings together the United States, India, Japan and Australia.
The US readout said the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing their commitment to strengthening cooperation through the Quad, while acknowledging that “a prosperous Indo-Pacific region remains vital to advancing our shared interests”.
Pakistan, which has been seeking to stabilise its economic relations with Washington while navigating an increasingly polarised regional environment, is also attending the critical minerals meeting.
Pakistani participation in the Washington gathering is seen as part of broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation in the development and processing of critical minerals.
India will diversify energy supplies: minister
India will diversify its energy sources as a strategy amid changing global circumstances and ensure energy security for its citizens, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday, days after the US said New Delhi will halt Russian oil purchases.
Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashed tariffs on Indian goods to 18pc from 50pc in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Trump said India would instead buy oil from the US and potentially Venezuela. The Kremlin on Tuesday, however, said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

 

In his first statement to the parliament on the trade deal, Goyal did not refer to shifting energy purchases away from any country.
Indian refiners have not been told by the government to stop buying Russian oil and would need a wind-down period to complete purchases already in process, Reuters reported.
In the US deal, India has successfully protected sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy, Goyal added.
Lawmakers from India’s opposition party Congress have questioned the lack of details on the deal and have sought clarifications on the extent of farm access offered to Washington.</p><small>2026-02-04 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04115155d04ae1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971009/gold-extends-rally-jumps-over-2pc-as-us-iran-tensions-flare' target='_blank'><strong>Gold extends rally, jumps over 2pc as US-Iran tensions flare</strong></a><br><p>Gold prices extended gains on Wednesday on safe-haven appeal, as renewed geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran added to the yellow metal’s recent upswing that saw it mark its best day since 2008 in the previous session.
Spot gold gained 2.7 per cent to$5,071.79 per ounce as of 03:53 GMT, after surging 5.9pc on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain since November 2008. Bullion scaled a record high of $5,594.82 last Thursday.
US gold futures for April delivery climbed 3.2pc to $5,092.0 per ounce.
“Gold has climbed back about the key $5,000 level, … (as) geopolitical tensions have lifted the metal’s safe-haven appeal after US forces downed an Iranian drone,” said Jigar Trivedi, a senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities.
The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.
Nuclear talks between the US and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source.
Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a spending deal into law that ends a partial US government shutdown, which had delayed key labour data reports that were due for release this week.
Investors expect at least two Fed interest rate cuts in 2026 and await ADP private payroll data later in the day for more cues on the Fed’s policy path. Non-yielding bullion tends to perform better in low-interest-rate environments.
“Going ahead (gold) prices may touch $5,100 in the very near-term … and we are expecting the same $5,600 levels by the end of the first half or April-end while prices will continue to rise thereafter and our year-end target is $6,000/oz,” Trivedi added.
The current wave is expected to be sharp, probably to surge into the $4,950 to $5,198 range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday.
Spot silver rose 3.2pc to $87.84 an ounce. It touched a record high of $121.64 on Thursday.
Spot platinum added 2.9pc to $2,273.70 per ounce after hitting an all-time high of $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium gained 3pc to $1,784.67.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112216dc82892.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971008/human-rights-watch-warns-us-heading-to-authoritarianism' target='_blank'><strong>Human Rights Watch warns US heading to ‘authoritarianism’</strong></a><br><p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was turning the United States into an authoritarian state as democracy declines globally to its lowest ebb in four decades.
Trump’s return to the White House has intensified a “downward spiral” on human rights that was already under pressure from Russia and China, the New York‑based advocacy and research group said in its annual report.
“The rules‑based international order is being crushed,” HRW said.
In the United States, the group said, Trump has shown “blatant disregard for human rights and egregious violations.”
In descriptions that would have been unthinkable in the US section of its previous annual reports, the group pointed to the deployment of masked, armed agents — the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency — which has carried out “hundreds of unnecessarily violent and abusive raids.”
“The administration’s racial and ethnic scapegoating, domestic deployment of National Guard forces in pretextual power grabs, repeated acts of retaliation against perceived political enemies and former officials now critical of him, as well as attempts to expand the coercive powers of the executive and neuter democratic checks and balances, underpin a decided shift towards authoritarianism in the US,” the report said.
Human Rights Watch repeated its finding that the United States engaged in enforced disappearances — a crime under international law — by sending 252 Venezuelan migrants to a maximum‑security prison in El Salvador.
In a recent report, HRW documented allegations by the men, who eventually were allowed into Venezuela, of being tortured, including beatings and sexual violence.
‘Less free’ now
Human Rights Watch pointed to metrics by which democracy has declined to the level of 1985 — when the Soviet Union still existed.
“Russia and China are less free today than 20 years ago. And so is the United States,” it said.
Philippe Bolopion, the group’s executive director, called on countries to form alliances based on respect for human rights and to stand together — including against the tariff‑wielding Trump.
“Some countries may be tempted to forge ad hoc alliances on specific issues — one day with China, another with Turkey, another with South Africa,” Bolopion told AFP.
“From our perspective, for such an alliance to be strong and lasting, it must be built on principles and values — democracy, international law, human rights,” he said.
“It can carry weight and provide a degree of security to its members,” he said.
The 529‑page report stands in contrast to the latest human rights report issued by the US State Department, which toned down sections on countries friendly to Trump.
The State Department report said El Salvador in 2024 saw “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” and that President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown on gangs has brought crime to a “historic low.”
The Human Rights Watch report also said that gang violence had “markedly declined” but that in 2025 authorities carried out “widespread abuses, including mass arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and ill‑treatment of detainees and due process violations.”
HRW again renewed its charge that Israel has carried out “crimes against humanity and acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing” against Palestinians in Gaza.
It said that Israeli authorities in 2025 “escalated their atrocities” which included “killing, maiming, starving and forcibly displacing Palestinians and destroying their homes, schools and infrastructure at a scale unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine.”
Israel has angrily rejected the Human Rights Watch genocide allegation first issued in December 2024, with the United States backing Israel’s stance.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04112028cf39dda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971007/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit.
Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.
The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.
With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.
It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.
Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.
“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.
The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.
“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.
The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate, under scrutiny.
The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.
Confidence restored
Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.
However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.
“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.
“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.
The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.
The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.
Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.
Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.
When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.
Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.
For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.</p><small>2026-02-04 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/04082705d296181.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970927/qadhafis-son-saif-shot-dead-in-libya' target='_blank'><strong>Qadhafi’s son Saif shot dead in Libya</strong></a><br><p>TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday.
Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men.
“Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said.
While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years.
In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule.
He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.
In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.
Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021.
Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades.
He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.
