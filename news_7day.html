The ad, commissioned by Doug Ford, Ontario’s outspoken Conservative premier who is sometimes compared to Trump, uses a snippet of Republican icon and former President Ronald Reagan saying that tariffs cause trade wars and economic disaster.
Prime Minister Mark Carney, unlike Ford, has sought to lower the temperature with Trump since taking office in March and had hoped for a deal to eliminate US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports.
 
 

In March, Ford, who often sports a “Canada is not for sale” hat, threatened to implement a surcharge on energy going to several American states if the US moved ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium.
Ford later relented, and the White House claimed victory, saying he had backed down. Ford said in a Friday statement that after discussions with Carney, Ontario would pause the US advertising campaign on Monday so that trade talks could resume. But the disputed commercial will continue to air this weekend as the Toronto Blue Jays play in the first two games of the World Series, he added. Ford said the message has reached US audiences “at the highest levels.”
 






Some analysts suggested that Ford’s ad was only a pretext for Trump’s outburst. Mr Trump doesn’t like to be confronted with the truth, said Asa McKercher, an expert in US-Canada politics at St. Francis Xavier University. He said that the ad is an accurate representation of Reagan’s views.
“If I was Canada, I’d take that same ad also,” McKercher said that Ford has often used his aggressive and populist style to appeal to American audiences in appearances on conservative-leaning outlets like Fox News, but his latest ad may have misfired. The Canadian dollar weakened after Trump broke off trade talks, and Ontario is the province most impacted by auto and steel tariffs.
When you use Ford’s attack-dog approach, there’s always a risk that you’re going to get smacked, McKercher said, adding it would be Carney who might need to make concessions to get Trump back to trade negotiations.
Still, Ford’s approach attracted some unusual support from politicians on the other side of the political spectrum. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, who heads the left-leaning New Democratic Party in the province, posted a message for his “good friend Doug Ford,” calling on him to keep running the ads.
Green Party leader Elizabeth May cheered “Go Doug Ford!” as she arrived at Parliament in Ottawa on Friday. Pollster Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, said Ford has acted “as the more pugilistic foil” when the prime minister has adopted a more conciliatory approach to Trump, noting that “it’s not a stance that generally hurts him (Ford).”
In February, Ford handily won a rare third term as Ontario premier. Earlier this month, Ford said he confronted and threatened to beat up a suspected shoplifter at a Home Depot store, telling an audience at a Toronto club, Screw this, Im going after this guy.
Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-26 05:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fcaf3165c87.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951168/smokers-corner-afghanistans-enduring-myth' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: AFGHANISTAN'S ENDURING MYTH?</strong></a><br><p>Recently, Pakistan went to war against Afghanistan. From the Afghan side, one began hearing the old trope that “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires”. First of all, Pakistan is not an empire, and secondly, the trope is mostly a myth.
In an August 2021 speech, delivered during the withdrawal of US military forces from Afghanistan, former US President Joe Biden said, “The events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, secure Afghanistan that is known in history as the graveyard of empires.” The researcher Alexander Hainy-Khaleeli wasn’t impressed. He wrote, “Biden labelling Afghanistan ‘the graveyard of empires’ is historically illiterate.” Truth is, the phrase has nothing to do with any grand historic narrative or fact. 
According to Hainy-Khaleeli, the phrase (in the context of Afghanistan) first appeared in a 2001 article written for the magazine Foreign Affairs by the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) former Pakistan Station Chief, Milton Bearden. The article was titled ‘Afghanistan: Graveyard of Empires’. There is scarce evidence of this phrase being used before Bearden’s article.
 
 

In 2001, when US forces were readying themselves to invade Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban regime and hunt down the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, Bearden cautioned the US government, claiming that major armies across history had tried to conquer Afghanistan but had run into trouble in their encounters with the unruly Afghan tribes. Bearden named the armies of the ancient Greek king Alexander, the ferocious Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, the British Empire and the Soviet Union that were all ‘defeated’ by the Afghans. 

The phrase ‘Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires’ is perpetuated by the Taliban as a way to mythologise the image of the ‘invincible’ Afghan, while non-Afghans use the trope as a way to rationalise defeat. But does this phrase make any historical sense?

But according to Hainy-Khaleeli, “Bearden’s argument is utterly at odds with the realities of history.” Alexander and Genghis Khan not only conquered Afghanistan, their successors ruled it for centuries after them. The ‘graveyard’ narrative also overlooks the fact that many empires — such as the Achaemenids, Kushans, Mughals and others — successfully ruled large parts of Afghanistan for extended periods. 
Indeed, in the 19th century, British armies did suffer defeats in Afghanistan (after conquering Kabul), but this hardly dented the British Empire as a whole. The Empire remained one of the largest and most powerful in the world till its disintegration from the mid-1940s onwards. This was mainly due to the impact of World War II and the period of decolonisation that followed. Afghanistan had absolutely nothing to do with this. 
Yet, many military experts do agree that Afghanistan is a tough nut to crack. However, their views in this regard have little to do with the mostly romanticised and idealised notion of the ‘legendary fighting spirit of the Afghans’ that turns empires into dust.
 
 

According to Patrick Porter, who teaches defence studies at Kings College in London, it is Afghanistan’s geography that makes it a tough country to conquer and keep. It is a country of mountains, deserts and severe winters that make it difficult not only to fight in but also to operate logistically. It limits mobility and it is difficult for an invading force to project power.
The phrase “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires” is likely to have been extracted from Bearden’s experiences as a CIA man during the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The CIA and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency, the ISI, were working together to finance, arm and train Afghan groups (the mujahideen) to fight against Soviet troops that had invaded Afghanistan in December 1979.
 


The mujahideen were also provided narratives to rationalise their insurgency. The fight was explained as a ‘jihad’ against an ‘atheist invader’ and a war of liberation. From within these macro-narratives also emerged many micro-narratives based on mythologised portrayals of the ‘historical warrior ethos’ of the Afghans. 
American and Pakistani governments strengthened these portrayals. Popular culture tools were also employed to solidify them. Examples include the Hollywood blockbuster movie Rambo 3 and the Pakistan TV play, Panah. A 1985 pamphlet published in Peshawar by an anti-Soviet jihadist group claimed that the mujahideen had begun to blow up Soviet tanks by simply standing in front of them and shouting “Allah-o-Akbar [God is great]!”
One can therefore assume that the “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires” myth, too, could’ve been circulating as one of the many micro-narratives at the time. But it was mainstreamed by Bearden in 2001. It most certainly has immediate roots in the anti-Soviet insurgency. But there are scholars who claim that the story of the mujahideen single-handedly defeating the Soviet military with American weapons is also a myth.
In his 2011 book Afgansty, British diplomat Rodric Braithwaite wrote that the war between Soviet troops and the mujahideen actually ended in a stalemate. The Soviet Army successfully controlled major cities and infrastructure, while the mujahideen controlled the countryside. According to Braithwaite, Soviet withdrawal (in 1989) was driven more by domestic Soviet politics and a desire to end a costly war than by a decisive military defeat. 
The ‘graveyard’ narrative has often been worked in two ways. The Taliban began to use it from the early 2000s as a warning to invaders and as a way to further fortify the mythologised image of the ‘invincible’ Afghan. On the other hand, non-Afghans use the trope as a way to rationalise a defeat: everyone loses here, so did we. Biden was doing exactly that in his speech. 
Either way, it is a simplistic trope that trivialises the geopolitical complexities that have shaped Afghanistan and the wars that have been fought there. As the Serbian historian Nemanja Jovanovi noted in 2022, despite its scarcity and lack of any desirable resources, Afghanistan has stood as an important geopolitical position for millennia. This made it a constant target for others to invade. Jovanovi suggests that it would be more apt to call Afghanistan a “battleground of empires” instead of ‘graveyard of empires.’ It is a place where major powers clash in their search for global/regional domination. 
Attacks by India-backed Islamist militants on Pakistan from Afghanistan are, therefore, treated by Pakistan as a threat to Pakistan’s growing reputation of becoming a rising power in South Asia.
Published in Dawn, EOS, October 26th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-26 05:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2609521762a78c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951291/ppp-reaffirms-commitment-to-farmers' target='_blank'><strong>PPP reaffirms commitment to farmers</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PPP has reiterated its commitment to supporting the farming community and vowed to continue its struggle to end all injustices faced by the farmers.
“PPP remains committed to respecting, empowering, and reviving the ag­­ricultural sector for a pr­­o­s­­perous Pakistan,” said the party’s Central Informa­tion Secretary Shazia Ma­­rri. She quoted PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­d­ari as saying that no economy can be strong if its farmers are weak.
“Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari believes that strengthening the farmer means strengthening Pakistan itself,” Ms Marri said in a statement issued on Saturday.
Ms Marri said that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s vision was clear — the true measure of progress lies in the prosperity of farmers. She recalled that during the PPP government, Pakistan had moved from wheat shortage to becoming a wheat-exporting country, owing to farmer-friendly policies.
She said that the PPP chairman had always stood by the farmers, advocating for timely procurement and fair prices.
Highlighting the impact of climate change, the PPP leader said that it posed a serious threat to every Pakistani farmer. She added that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari emphasised the need for investment in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, envisioning a modern agricultural economy where small farmers could progress through technology and access to fair markets.
She said the PPP believed that insurance, credit access, and transparent governance were essential to protect farmers from the adverse effects of climate change.
Ms Marri appreciated the government’s decision to allow wheat procurement, terming it a longstanding demand of the PPP. She added that approving the support price for wheat was also a PPP demand; however, she noted that fixing the price at Rs4,000 instead of Rs3,500 per 40kg would have been more beneficial for farmers. She further said that reducing the income tax from 45 per cent to 15pc was an important relief measure for the farming community.

A day earlier, hundreds of supporters of the now-proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had arrived in town, en route to Islamabad, where they planned to stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. As they reached Muridke, roughly an hour’s drive from Lahore, where they had started the march, the protesters found there was no way to move forward as the police had dug trenches along the main roads.

Unwilling to turn back, the protesters had set up camp for the night on GT Road — the main artery linking Lahore to Gujranwala — intending to strategise on the next move in the morning. Before dawn, however, all hell broke loose.
The buildup
Even a week after that fateful night between Oct 12 and 13, the almost one-kilometre stretch of GT Road, where the TLP had set up camp, bore marks of the deadly scuffles between the protesters and law enforcers. For the purpose of this report, Dawn spoke to a number of residents on both sides of GT Road, traders who run shops in the area and local correspondents affiliated with newspapers and TV channels.
On Oct 12, the local correspondents, who seldom find their news reports broadcast on national TV, suddenly found their phones buzzing nonstop as reports of law enforcers making their way to the town to take on the TLP protesters started surfacing. For residents, the thousands of law enforcers, including the Punjab Police, FC and Rangers, taking up positions in adjoining streets and corners was a worrying sight.
“We saw for the first time over 3,000 personnel of the FC and the Pakistan (Punjab) Rangers in the streets of Muridke on October 13,” a local trader, who runs a grocery shop in Malkan Wala Bazaar, told Dawn.
The trader, A*, lives with his five-member family in an adjoining street of the same bazaar and witnessed the entire saga unfold firsthand.
“Muridke city is home to three major bazaars — Malkan Wala, Tanki and Service Bazaar — on both sides of GT Road, and this is where the TLP protesters and police forces clashed early on October 13,” he reminisced.
As the night wore on, A* narrated, many of his friends and relatives who lived in the area exchanged messages with each other on what was going on in their respective streets and lanes. But communication wasn’t smooth either, likely due to the jammers activated by the law enforcers before they launched the crackdown, said A*.

“Some of my relatives and friends narrated that they saw unusually heavy movement of security forces in their respective streets and mohallas,” he said.
At around 3:30am, he continued, all hell broke loose. It started with what sounded like small explosions as police fired tear gas shells, followed by the sound of heavy gunfire. The streets echoed with the clackety-clack of boots as the law enforcers advanced toward the TLP camp. “All my family members were terrified,“ recounted A*. “We switched off all the lights in the house and kept listening to the cries outside the house,” he added.
A pitched battle
This next part of the saga has been stitched together from the accounts of local correspondents, traders and residents of Muridke, as well as corroborated by senior officials of the Punjab Police.
According to senior police officials and representatives of Muridke’s traders’ union, over 10,000 personnel of law enforcement agencies, including the Punjab Police, participated in the large-scale ‘cordon-and-search operation’. Units of FC and Rangers had reached Muridke earlier in the day from Rawalpindi on a special train, as the roads had already been dug up by the authorities.
By late evening, the law enforcers had mapped out all the streets and neighbourhoods near the protest camp through surveillance drones. The forces were then split up and deployed at the identified points with the aim of launching an operation from all four sides. In previous encounters with the police, workers of the religio-political outfit have used smaller streets and bazaars as hideouts to regroup and launch counter-attacks on law enforcers.

“This time, the authorities came up with a new strategy: they blocked all the streets and bazaars by deploying hundreds of law enforcers an hour before launching the final operation,” explained a local correspondent, B*, of a TV channel. Meanwhile, elite police units were put on high alert for hostage rescue, in case the situation took a turn for the worse.
B* added that the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) Muridke was converted into a ‘temporary headquarters’, wherefrom senior officials of the federal and Punjab governments, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar and the head of a federal security agency, supervised the operation.
A few minutes before the operation officially commenced at 3:30am, the law enforcers gave a final warning to the protesters to surrender themselves. The TLP leadership, however, ignored the warning and responded with threats of “a befitting response”.
On finding the TLP chief and his supporters unmoved, the law enforcers started moving towards the protest camp, led by six armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and followed by hundreds of anti-riot personnel. The teams were supervised by the Regional Police Officers (RPOs) of Sheikhupura, Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala, who led their respective units on both sides of GT Road.
Seeing the police personnel advancing towards the camp, the protesters who had taken up positions on an overhead pedestrian bridge pelted them with stones. In response, the police fired teargas at the crowd in a bid to disperse them, which led to scuffles between the two sides.
According to a senior police officer, who was leading one of the units in the operation, the majority of protesters at the time had gone to nearby mosques and the homes of local supporters to rest, leaving around 1,500-2,000 of them at the protest camp on GT Road. As the law enforcers moved closer towards the camp, the TLP leaders asked their workers to make announcements in the local mosques about the imminent police operation and to urge them to return to the camp immediately.
Soon after, a mob attacked the police. Amid the scuffle, a heavy trailer, which had been part of the TLP convoy, drove into an APC. At this point, senior officials were informed that several protesters had dragged a police inspector and beaten him black and blue; he later succumbed to his injuries.
According to police officials who spoke to Dawn, they were shocked to see that several TLP protesters started firing at the police convoy. A senior police officer said the firing from the protest camp continued for several minutes, leaving the law enforcers stunned as they had not expected the TLP workers to be armed.
At this point, the police command decided to act swiftly — to first rescue the personnel stuck in the APC and then launch a round-up operation against the TLP workers from all sides. On receiving the instructions, the police personnel deployed in the streets and bazaars moved forward, while other formations also marched towards the protest camp.
According to residents who spoke to Dawn, the police personnel retaliated against the TLP protesters and returned fire, which continued sporadically for over three hours. The residents said that the gunshots echoed through the streets as the bullets ricocheted off buildings and structures, shattering windows and doors in some instances. Meanwhile, the air grew thick with white smoke from the tear gas and hung over the town like fog for the next several hours. Several residents recounted a thick smoke and a pungent smell, which made their eyes burn, constricted their throats and made it difficult to breathe even inside their homes.

When the operation finally ended at around 7:30am, the police made several announcements on loudspeakers, instructing residents to stay in their homes. When they were finally allowed to leave several hours later, they found thousands of cartridges and bullet casings strewn on the roads and streets, besides bloodstains at the protest camp.
A Muridke-based trader, who asked not to be named, told Dawn that when he reached the venue in the morning, the air hung heavy with the acrid smell of smoke and gunpowder. The road was littered with wreckage, including several vehicles that had been burned beyond recognition.
Surprisingly, he said, he found no trace of any TLP worker, nor anyone who may have been injured or died in the four-hour-long skirmish with the police. “No one knows who took them [injured persons or bodies] away,” said the trader, adding that on the previous night, around 5,000 to 7,000 protesters had been present at the camp on GT Road. Not a single one remained when the operation ended.
Claims, counter-claims
As the country awoke the next day to find the protest camp disbanded, news reports started trickling in on what had gone down in Muridke in the dead of the night. While there was no official word on the death count, TLP-affiliated social media accounts claimed hundreds of their workers had been killed.

Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar later rubbished the reports, saying two TLP workers had died during scuffles in Lahore, while seven had been killed in Muridke. “The police force opened fire in self-defence and that too in response to the armed attack carried out by some of the protesters,” the Punjab Police said.
“The Punjab police have so far registered 75 cases under sections of terrorism, murder and attempt to murder, while 30 FIRs were registered for other offences against the TLP chief, its senior leaders and workers,” said the IGP. They have, however, yet to arrest the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi and his brother, Anas, who are believed to have fled to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister, addressing a press conference on Oct 21, said that three civilian passersby lost their lives in Muridke, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen of the 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said.
The federal government has since banned the TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the recommendation of the Punjab government.
Back in Muridke, the town slowly crawls back to normalcy, its residents still in disbelief over what transpired here on that fateful night. While much of the wreckage has been cleared, the protest site still bears signs of what transpired here. And yet, questions linger: where did the TLP protesters vanish? How is it possible for the death toll to be so low after four hours of gunfire? Were the injured protesters provided medical aid?

A wave of lethal attacks on its security forces in the erstwhile tribal districts along the Durand Line had triggered a response by the Pakistani military in which aerial assets were used to target TTP safe havens on Afghan soil as deep inside as the capital Kabul.
 
 

The Afghan Taliban forces had retaliated by firing artillery on Pakistani positions along the border and as Pakistan responded with military muscle, international calls for restraint led to a ceasefire which was cemented in the Doha round between the two sides mediated by Qatar. In Doha, the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by the militant movement founder Mullah Omar’s son, Defence Minister Mullah Mohammed Yaqoob, who is said to be aligned with the Haqqani group led by Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani rather than the hard(er)-line ideologues’ Kandahar group under the supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhunzada.
To a rank outsider like me, some of the speculation of serious internal differences within the Afghan Taliban movement between the Kandahar group and the Haqqanis seems exaggerated as decisions taken by the supreme leader are implemented by all, even if this happens after a bit of to and fro, indicating a process of consultation.
Despite some Taliban leaders’ apparently feigned unease over issues such as the bar on women’s education and consultation which led to the rescinding of the recent decision to ban the internet after realising it would not be in the Afghan Taliban’s interest, the movement seems united. For now, at least, both the Kandahar ideologues and the Haqqani group seem to be on the same page on the TTP.

There can be no stressing enough the ideological affinity the Afghan Taliban feel towards the TTP.

Of course, this poses a huge dilemma for Pakistan’s security agencies which had patronised and harboured ‘Haqqani Network’ leaders and foot soldiers throughout the two decades of the occupation of Afghanistan by the US-led Nato forces, in the hope of cashing in one day. When the US withdrew and its propped-up Afghan government collapsed in a day, leaving the field open for the Taliban to take over the capital and the country (large parts of which they controlled during the US occupation too), Pakistan soon realised there was nothing for it to cash in on.
With the defence and interior ministries firmly in the Haqqani group’s grip, the hope was that the TTP would be put on a tight leash. That did not happen. If anything, the TTP’s terror attacks on Pakistani forces intensified, drawing considerable blood. The resultant escalation eventually led to the Doha ceasefire, which went from temporary to ‘permanent’. The Istanbul round of the consultations will focus on how to ensure the permanence of this cessation of hostilities. The Hangu IED blast that took the lives of three policemen including an SP underlined the difficulties in ensuring the ceasefire lasts.
Dawn’s defence and foreign affairs correspondent Baqir Sajjad Syed in his lead story on Saturday suggests that the Turk mediators are likely to play a role in evolving a verification mechanism for the terms of the ceasefire agreement, given their experience in dealing with their own violent Kurdish rebel group — the PKK.
It is still not clear how much leverage Qatar, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have with the Afghan Taliban. These are some of the major players who brought both sides to the negotiating table, but can they convince the Afghan Taliban to place restrictions on the TTP, or to, as was suggested at one point, relocate them far from the Pak-Afghan border areas?
Sources familiar with the thinking of the Afg­han Taliban do not find credible the speculation that Kabul fears antagonising the TTP because the terror group may join hands with Daesh or IS-K terrorists in Afghanistan and challenge them. On the contrary, they say, that the Afghan Taliban at least privately justify their inaction against, even support to, the TTP, saying the latter supported them and fought alongside them during the long US occupation and, therefore, they would be reluctant to turn their back on their ideological twins from across the Durand Line.
 
 

The irony of this state of affairs can’t be stressed enough. Many TTP factions were the creation of the Pakistan’s security establishment, so that, in future, influence could be exercised over the Afghan Taliban to ensure a rock solid Western border with no vulnerabilities. But now, the TTP itself has become that vulnerability, the Achilles heel.
Also, there can be no stressing enough the ideological affinity the Afghan Taliban feel towards the TTP. All our theories of the ‘good vs bad Taliban’ have been shredded in the terror attacks which have claimed the lives of thousands of Pakistanis.
What can the mediators offer the Afghan Taliban to prise them away from their TTP twins? For now, whatever is in the public domain suggests very little. Who knows, recognising the Taliban regime and other forms of political and economic incentives might work. Or for that matter if there is a will at all in the first place to dangle good behaviour prizes before them.
What Pakistan can do in the meantime is to revise and implement the National Action Plan which was approved in 2014 after the Peshawar APS massacre and revised in 2021. This must be done whatever the long-term outcome of the Istanbul talks. Not just this. The state, which injected the body politic with the CIA-developed-supplied ‘extremism virus’ to counter the Red Army in Afghanistan, must ask itself if it has an antidote for that? Like me, I am sure, you’d be eager to learn the answer too.

Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-26 04:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fd820812941.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951308/an-ideological-shift' target='_blank'><strong>An ideological shift?</strong></a><br><p>THE recent suppression of the ultra-radical Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) by state institutions has raised a series of intriguing questions. What compelled the state to act so decisively against a group once seen as its ideological ally? Does this signify a genuine transformation in the state’s approach towards all shades of extremism, or is it merely a tactical response to an immediate challenge and an isolated episode rather than an ideological shift?
Despite the intensity of the state’s current posture, there is little room for optimism about a deeper change of heart within the power institutions. Such a transformation requires not only political will but also credible and appealing alternatives, both ideological and structural. Unfortunately, neither the intelligentsia nor broader society has as yet cultivated a coherent alternative narrative capable of inspiring the state or filling the ideological vacuum left by the retreat of extremism.
 
 

Pakistan still lacks a viable model of moderate Islam, whether leaning towards secular modernity or grounded in indigenous reformist thought, that could simultaneously assure national cohesion and align with the interests of the ruling elites. Historically, the state has sought cohesion through religio-national narratives rather than constitutional consensus. The notion of constitutional cohesion, one rooted in equitable resource distribution, sociopolitical empowerment, and the recognition of ethnic, linguistic and cultural pluralism, has never found favour with the country’s power structures.
What, then, is the alternative? The state institutions may attempt to take direct control of the processes of narrative formation, a domain it had long outsourced to the religious clergy. But if it seeks to reclaim that space, critical questions arise: how capable is the state of managing such an ideational project, which is far removed from bureaucratic routine? And what would that new narrative look like?

The deeper challenge lies in confronting ideological legacies.

One possible answer lies in the emerging contours of Pakistan’s official discourse. The new outlook may appear more overtly anti-Indian, seeking a sharper detachment from what is described as ‘Hindu South Asia’. In this process, religion may continue to serve as a legitimising framework, not as a theocratic aspiration but as a cultural and ideological boundary marker. Many observers have interpreted the army chief’s speeches since late last year in this light: a renewed emphasis on the two-nation theory as the moral and historical foundation of Pakistan’s being.
If the state now decides to assume full control of the narrative-building enterprise, the resulting discourse is likely to be more anti-India, yet less religious. Such a shift could reframe Pakistan’s identity and image in a way that appears more rational, pragmatic, and compatible with the evolving global and regional order. It could also enable the state to pursue its strategic and political objectives across South and Central Asia with reduced religious zeal, and potentially pave the way for a gradual de-religionisation of its relations with Afghanistan, Iran and the Arab world.
However, the question remains: even amid these discussions of a new narrative, do state institutions have the will to completely abandon their former allies — the vast religious networks whose political and economic influence has grown exponentially over the decades? Pakistan is home to more than 248 religiously inspired parties and over 40,000 seminaries, whose graduates are steadily encroaching on the public and private education sectors, social services and even the lower tiers of the state bureaucracy.
While the religious parties themselves may continue to survive, institutions such as the Council of Islamic Ideology, which has long operated under state patronage, will still require human resources capable of aligning wholeheartedly with the emerging state discourse. Yet such alignment is far from guaranteed.
 
 

The deeper challenge lies not merely in managing religious groups but in confronting the ideological legacies they have embedded within society. The narratives nurtured by extremist and sectarian forces have seeped deeply into the public consciousness, shaping popular attitudes, influencing politics and permeating bureaucratic thinking. This entrenchment was inadvertently acknowledged by former interior minister Rana Sanaullah, who remarked that while no one disagreed with the TLP’s viewpoint or narrative, the state acted against it only because of its violent methods.
Many within the political and bureaucratic elite still share this sentiment. They argue that there has been no real change of heart within the state, suggesting that the TLP issue should not be mistaken for a broader strategic shift. Their reasoning is pragmatic: the group’s increasing aggressiveness had begun to undermine policing, particularly in Punjab, where some semi-literate lawyers and local activists associated with the TLP were exerting pressure on police to act against minority religious communities. Moreover, the group’s conduct was tarnishing Pakistan’s international image at a time when the state was eager to project moderation and stability.
The state’s current strategy appears focused on defusing the TLP’s street power through asset freezes, demoralising its cadres, isolating it from the wider Barelvi community, and fostering internal divisions within it. This may yield temporary calm, but whether it signals a durable policy shift or another episode of tactical containment remains to be seen.
This represents a departure from the strategy the state once employed to curb the influence of sectarian and extremist organisations such as Sipah-i-Sahaba and several Shia militant groups. Previously, the method was sequential: ban the organisation, keep it under engagement, and gradually weaken it from within. Through a mix of legal, administrative, and coercive tools, the state managed to contain the toxicity of sectarian narratives. Yet this process spanned nearly two decades and came at a considerable political and social cost.
Having learned from that protracted experience, the state appears to have opted for a different course in the TLP’s case — a swift, decisive approach designed to neutralise the group’s street power and organisational momentum before it becomes entrenched.
At least on the surface, this approach seems likely to yield short-term gains. The TLP’s structures have been disrupted, its activities curtailed, and its influence checked. Yet the sentiments the group cultivated are emotional, religiously cha­r­ged and rooted in perceptions of moral ownership over national identity, and are unlikely to vanish. They may re-emerge in another, perhaps even more volatile, form, or be appropriated by new religious actors seeking to fill the ideological void.

In this regard, the signing of the Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement last month was seen as a major development in the geopolitical and defence spheres.
Though Islamabad and Riyadh have been allies for decades, the pact has solidified the defence relationship, even though questions remain about some of the finer details of the deal. Regardless, comments by Pakistani officials that the pact could be expanded to other states have led to speculation in global media that a ‘Muslim Nato’ may be in the works, specifically due to the stated mutual defence clause of the Pak-Saudi deal.
It is indeed an enticing — if difficult to achieve — idea that a collective defensive arrangement could prevent aggression against Muslim states. In the past year, Pakistan has faced aggression from India. Elsewhere, Israel has been on the rampage. In the current year alone, apart from the genocide in Gaza, the Zionist state has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Qatar and Iran. Perhaps if the Muslim states had a stronger defensive arrangement, Tel Aviv might have thought twice about carrying out the slaughter in occupied Palestine, as well as attacking sovereign countries at will.
 
 

While bilateral pacts are one thing, as this paper has previously noted, the framework for a defensive arrangement of Muslim states already exists in the shape of the Saudi Arabia-based Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, headed by former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. The need is to extend this coalition to all OIC members, and ensure that aggression against one is indeed considered aggression against all. Excluding any Muslim state will defeat the purpose of the entire endeavour. This reformed alliance should focus on collective defence, and no other states or blocs should feel threatened by it.
Though the OIC has hardly lived up to its potential, perhaps facing existential challenges to their sovereignty, Muslim states may now seriously consider putting up a united political and military defence to prevent aggression against all OIC members. Such an alliance can work on several principles, foremost of which can be defending against external threats and coordinating action against transnational terrorist groups.
Moreover, once Muslim states bind themselves under a collective defence framework, it may be easier to resolve intra-Muslim disputes peacefully, such as the Pakistan-Afghan stalemate. Nato may not be the best exemplar, but it has proven that European states that were once at war with each other have now combined forces for a common defence. Muslim states can choose to work in silos and pursue narrow interests. Or they can pool their resources and put up a collective defence in times of immense insecurity.

Separately, a station house officer (SHO) was injured in Hangu during follow-up action after a bomb attack on Friday evening that killed SP Asad Zubair and two police guards.
In the Jhallar area of North Waziristan, security forces killed three militants and averted a “potential catastrophic attack” by destroying a vehicle being prepared for a suicide attack, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Acting on intelligence about the presence of “Khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij”, troops “effectively engaged” the militants’ location and destroyed the vehicle besides killing three militants.

SHO wounded in follow-up action after attack on SP

The state uses the term Fitna al-Khawarij to refer to militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign … by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said.
Separately, security officials said a targeted operation in War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur left five militants dead and several injured.
The operation, conducted on intelligence reports about the presence of militants in the Badan area, continued over two days, according to residents who confirmed sustained movement by security forces.
 
 

Local sources claimed the militants were using a mosque built for refugees as a hideout. The ISPR did not immediately issue a statement on the Bajaur operation.
Leaders of the Bajaur Aman Jirga staged a demonstration in the Umary area on Saturday evening, demanding that authorities avoid harm to civilians during operations.
In Hangu, four militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the rugged mountains on Friday evening. The operation was launched after an improvised explosive device (IED) attack that martyred SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two guards. The SHO of the Doaba police station was injured in the ensuing action.
The area has witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the banned TTP in recent months.

Several institutions are organising the test, including the Uni­ver­sity of Health Sciences in Lahore, Suk­kur IBA University, Khyber Medical Uni­versity in Peshawar, Bolan Uni­versity of Medical and Health Scie­nces in Quetta, and Shaheed Zulfi­qar Ali Bhutto Medical University in Islamabad.
Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) President Dr Rizwan Taj said that all participating universities had assured him that the necessary arrangements for the test have been made.
“All universities conducting the MDCAT were advised to thoroughly review and implement all required arrangements to ensure the fair, tr­­a­­­nsparent, and secure conduct of the examination,” Mr Taj said. He added that security measures in­­­­­c­l­u­­de the installation of jammers to blo­­­ck unauthorised electronic devices.

“Examination venues will be eq­­u­ipped with proper seating arra­ngements and adequate facilities to ac­­commodate all candidates co­­mfortably,” he said.
“Furthermore, universities are instructed to make ap­­­propriate arrangements for heating or cooling of the examination halls according to weather conditions and to ensure that drinking water is readily available to all candidates,” he added.
To ensure transparency and proper record-keeping, specific protocols have been established for the exam materials.
“Universities shall provide bubble sheets with carbon copies to the candidates and must ensure complete secrecy and confidentiality of all question papers,” Mr Taj stated.
“Question papers shall be ope­n­­ed only in the presence of witnesses to maintain transparency. After the conclusion of the examination, all bubble sheets must be collected promptly and kept in a safe and secured location”, he added
He also mentioned that the original examination papers of the MDCAT would be retained by the respective universities for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of the result declaration.
Mr Taj emphasised a swift and tra­­nsparent process for releasing results. The official answer key will be uploaded to university websites immediately after the exam, with full results expected within one week.
Mr Taj said that a comprehensive post-hoc analysis report had to be prepared and submitted within 10 days of the announcement of the final results. He further mentioned that universities were required to provide a facility for the re-checking of marks within three days following the announcement of the results.

• Plea alleges officials implicated woman in criminal case
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has ordered the constitution of a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate into the alleged abduction of a woman and her three minor children, an episode now linked to a multimillion-rupee Naval Farms land scam recently unearthed by a joint enquiry committee (JEC).
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by Muhammad Waqas and others.
 
 

The petition alleged that police officials, acting on behalf of unidentified people, abducted Sana Sohail, wife of Aleem Sohail, who worked in a private farm, along with her daughters — 12-year-old Harim, seven-year-old Laiba, and three-year-old Nimra — from Lahore on Sept 17.
It added that the officials later implicated the woman in a fabricated criminal case at the Tarnol police station in Islamabad.
According to the court order, CCTV footage dated Sept 17 confirmed that the woman and her children were taken into custody at around 7am with the assistance of the Punjab police and transported to Islamabad.
They were later shown as arrested in an FIR, which was registered three days later under various provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Arms Ordinance.
The judge observed that the incident occurred prior to the filing of the FIR, raising “serious questions about the legality of the police action”.
The investigation officer (IO) failed to identify those who had ordered the operation or to justify the presence of two Suzuki Alto cars and other vehicles recovered at the CIA centre in Islamabad.
The IHC directed the Islamabad police chief to appear in person on Oct 28 and explain the conduct of the Tarnol SHO and the IO.
The CIA centre SP was instructed to produce the vehicles and submit a detailed report describing how they were taken into custody.
Justice Kayani also summoned the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) director general and ordered the creation of a JIT to investigate into the alleged abduction, trespassing, and fabrication of criminal charges. The FIA DG was told to supervise the inquiry.
The order pointed out that Duty Jud­ic­ial Magistrate Yasir Mehmood Chaudhry had sent Ms Sohail to judicial custody and placed her children with the Child Pro­t­e­ction Bureau without the inquiry required under law concerning their welfare.
The member inspection team of the high court was directed to summon the magistrate for an explanation.
Land scam
The IHC proceedings are closely connected to a separate high-level probe by the JEC, comprising high ranking officials including Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, director generals of the Inter-Services Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau, a senior superintendent of Islamabad police as well as a naval commander, which earlier uncovered a sophisticated land scam involving 136 kanals of property in Mera Begwal, Islamabad.
The JEC found that the land had been illegally transferred through a manipulated general power of attorney (GPA) and fraudulent documents.
According to the JEC report, the GPA used for the transfer bore genuine signatures and thumb impressions of the landowner, Musharraf Rasool Cyan, but the sale clause was inserted later.
The inquiry also discovered fake stamp papers and affidavits and traced financial transactions exceeding Rs383.8 million.
Muhammad Waqas, the petitioner in the IHC case, was identified as Mr Cyan’s farm employee, who had received the funds from land provider Faisal Mumtaz and the Pakistan Navy Benevolent Association. Mr Waqas, who earned Rs50,000 a month, withdrew or transferred Rs326.95m.
Another employee, Aleem Sohail, and his wife Ms Sohail — the woman allegedly abducted — were also found to have received large unexplained deposits.
The JEC expressed astonishment that the PNBA and Mr Mumtaz paid such huge sums to a farm worker without verifying ownership or contacting the actual landowner.
It recommended the cancellation of the fraudulent mutation, legal action against those involved, freezing of assets, as well as reforms in property registration and biometric verification systems.

Once a political outsider, Mamdani’s campaign has surged, powered by young progressive volunteers and growing frustration over the city’s soaring cost of living.
His pledge to freeze rents for two million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised properties has resonated in a city where affordable housing is increasingly out of reach.
If elected, Mamdani would be New York’s first Muslim mayor — a historic milestone. Observers, however, note that his popularity stems primarily from his progressive and socialist positions rather than his faith.

Mamdani champions labour unions, wealth taxation, expanded public transit, and climate-friendly housing.  He also emphasises social inclusion, protecting undocumented immigrants through sanctuary city policies, defending LGBTQ rights, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and education.
These stances earned him strong support from younger and diverse voters, including African American and Hispanic communities.
“Mamdani has energised people who feel shut out of traditional politics,” said Moviz Siddiqui of Queens. “He talks about fairness and affordability in a way that connects with everyone — Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists — it doesn’t matter.”
Opponents have sought to make his faith an issue. Responding, Mr Mamdani pledged to embrace his Muslim identity more openly, calling such attacks “racist and baseless”.
“The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he told a Muslim gathering outside a Brooklyn mosque on Friday.
Mamdani, who has denounced Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide,” has faced online abuse and political backlash. Yet a Victory Insights poll from October 22-23 shows him leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 18 points, with 47 per cent support. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 16 pc.
After a long hesitation, Dem­ocratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have also endorsed Mamdani, signalling party unity ahead of the November 4 election.
 
 

Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers,” Mr Jeffries said.
Mr Schumer added, “He ran an impressive campaign that connected with New Yorkers about affordability, fairness, and opportunity,” defending him against conservative calls to denaturalise him.
Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York as a child. His father is a Ugandan Mus­lim scholar, and his mother, Mira Nair, is a Hindu Indian filmmaker.
This diverse heritage has resonated across New York’s South Asian community, uniting voters from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
Muslim leaders, however, remain divided. Councilwoman Shahana Hanif called Mamdani “a bridge-builder”, noting their shared work to heal post-9/11 divides. Meanwhile, New Jersey-based Nasir Qayyum Khan cautioned that Mamdani’s progressive stances may conflict with more conservative Muslim values.
Early voting in New York has grown steadily since 2019. In June’s mayoral primary, about 35 percent of ballots were cast early. This year, early voting runs through November 2, with Election Day on November 4. The winner will take office in January.

• Citizens urged to wear masks, avoid unnecessary outdoor activity
• PDMA says smog intensity expected to rise from Nov to mid-Dec
• Govt imposes blanket ban on stubble, solid waste, plastic burning
LAHORE: Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources.
Data revealed that Lower Mall was the worst-affected neighbourhood, with an AQI of 680, followed by Iqbal Town (577), Syed Maratib Ali Road (543), Shadman (507), the Punjab University area (506), and Shalimar (495).
Environmental experts have urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, particularly in the morning and evening, and to wear masks when outside. PM2.5 concentrations in Lahore’s air are multiple times above global safety thresholds, raising risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness among other serious health issues, especially for children and the elderly.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur.
“The intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December,” warned DG PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The PDMA has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners to ensure the implementation of government measures to combat smog.
The authorities have announced a strict, multi-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution at its source. A comprehensive ban has been imposed on the burning of crop residues, solid waste, tires, plastic and rubber.
Mr Kathia stated that a case would be registered for any violation, including the burning of crop stubble and garbage.
Simultaneously, the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) has intensified its anti-smog operations, using advanced drone cameras to monitor industrial zones, agricultural land, and urban areas.
In the last 24 hours, this tech-driven initiative identified over 460 smog-related violations. More than 200 e-challans were issued to smoke-emitting vehicles, with real-time data shared with departments for immediate action.
While enforcement is critical, the government is also pushing for long-term, sustainable solutions. At a seminar in the Kabirwala town of Khanewal district, the Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change educated farmers on using modern machinery to manage crop residue, particularly rice stubble, without burning.
Officials and experts highlighted that this waste can be repurposed in biomass plants to generate steam and energy, turning an environmental problem into an economic opportunity.
“Smog is a serious environmental and public health issue, requiring collective and coordinated efforts to address it,” said Project Coordinator Dr Younus Zahid.
As the government leverages technology for enforcement and promotes alternative farming practices, the public has been urged to play its part.
Citizens have been asked to report smog-inducing activities on the emergency helpline 15, with authorities emphasising that only a collective effort can clear the hazardous air and protect public health.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that nine departments were conducting large-scale operations against smog.
The minister said that the environmental protection force and the department were fully mobilised, that all sectoral squads were present in the field, and that brick kilns were being monitored through drones, in addition to issuing a live report.
She added that anti-smog cannons and air-quality monitors are deployed and that AQI forecasting, which she said has been introduced for the first time in Punjab, has enabled earlier interventions to curb pollution spikes.

• Insiders say decision ‘almost finalised’, incumbent premier may be given choice of ‘honourable exit’
ISLAMABAD: As the PPP plans to install its own prime minister in Azad Jammu Kashmir, the party lawmakers from the region separately met party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari to mull options for the removal of the incumbent PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq.
Only a picture of Mr Zardari’s meeting with the lawmakers was issued by Saturday night, while a handout issued by the PPP regarding the meeting with Mr Bhutto-Zardari also did not mention the possibility of a no-confidence motion against the AJK premier. The party leaders discussed the AJK’s “political situation” in the meeting, said the official statement.
 
 

Sources, however, claimed the party meeting considered names for Mr Haq’s successor. They said the PPP had “almost finalised” the decision to oust the AJK prime minister through a no-trust motion. A formal decision, according to sources, is likely in a day or two.
The insiders said the party leaders deliberated upon all possible options, including giving some time to the AJK prime minister for “an honourable exit”, before making any move to remove the premier through a no-trust vote.
According to the sources, the meeting also explored potential successors, with Chaudhry Yaseen, Chaudhry Latif Akbar and Sardar Yaqoob emerging as strong contenders for the coveted post. In the AJK assembly, the PPP, with the support of the PML-N, has the support of more than 27 lawmakers — a magic number required to form the government. The PPP has 17 members in the house, 10 of whom are ministers and two are advisers, while AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar also hails from the PPP.
It may be noted that the PPP had already decided it would not remain a part of the government, but it remained undecided about whether to sit on the opposition benches or form its own government in the region.
Meanwhile, the official statement by the party said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari presided over the PPP AJK Parliamentary group meeting and “discussed the political situation” in AJK.
The statement added that the PPP leaders of the AJK chapter discussed improving the organisational structure of the party in the region and the current political situation in AJK.
The meeting was also attended by former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and former Kashmir affairs minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who had recently led a federal government delegation to talk to the protesters in AJK and remained successful in ending the protest after an agreement was signed in the first week of October. At least 10 had been killed while scores were injured in clashes between the law enforcers and the protesters that lasted for days. PPP Women Wing’s Central President Faryal Talpur was also present in the meeting.
Others who attended the meeting included Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, Faisal Mumtaz, Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Sardar Javed Ayub, Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, Mian Abdul Waheed, Javed Iqbal Bandhanvi, Syed Bazil Naqvi, Syed Zia Qamar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Chaudhry Aamir Yasin, Aamir Ghaffar Lone, Javed Butt, Rafiq Nayyar, Nabila Ayub, Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz, and Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.

They said that Brewery area police were conducting snap checking at Western Bypass when they signalled a suspected car to stop. However, the occupants opened fire on the police and tried to flee from the scene. 
Police retaliated and chased the vehicle, which was later intercepted in Killi Khali, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta. A heavy exchange of fire ensued between the police and the suspects, continuing for some time.
As a result, three armed men in the car were killed, while a police constable was injured.

“The suspected armed men were killed in the exchange of fire,” confirmed Deputy Superintendent of Police, Saddar Division, Shoukat Jadoon, adding that the injured constable was shifted to a hospital for treatment. 
The bodies of the three suspects were taken to Bolan Medical College Hospital for medico-legal formalities.
Initial investigation suggested that the suspects were involved in serious criminal activities, including robberies and kidnapping for ransom. “They were in the area with the intent to commit a robbery or another crime,” a senior police officer said.
He said that arms and ammunition were also recovered from the possession of suspects. 
Police have launched an investigation and are conducting raids to arrest other members of the gang. 
Two militants killed
Meanwhile, two alleged militants were killed and another injured in a landmine blast in the Sui area of Dera Bugti district on Saturday.
Officials said that the incident occurred when suspected militants were planting a landmine along the roadside in the Lanjoo-Saghari area of tehsil Sui.
“The landmine exploded while suspects were planting it to target security personnel and other people,” Levies officials said, adding that two of the three suspects were killed on the spot while the third sustained serious injuries.
Security personnel and Levies officials rushed to the site soon after the explosion and shifted the bodies and the injured to the Sui hospital.
The victims have not yet been identified, while Levies have launched an investigation into the incident.

The seven cops were suspended a day ago after the incident came to light. While the police claimed that Muhammad Irfan died of heart attack, his relatives alleged that he was tortured to death.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered the same day at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers.
“The SIU/CIA police have handed over custody of two suspects nominated in FIR … who have been arrested. If need be, we shall convert the case to 302 (premeditated murder) and arrest more SIU officials if they were found involved,” said South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza whicle speaking to Dawn.
He confirmed that “preliminary post-mortem report establishes torture”.
Meanwhile, a large number of relatives and members of the community staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road.
Senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, one of the protesters, told Dawn that the people were demonstrating because “the case has been registered on complaint of the killers”. He said the policemen had promised the relatives that  the FIR would be registered on the family’s complaint.
“The relatives visited the SIU/CIA centre on Friday night for the purpose of the FIR, but the police had already got the FIR registered on behalf of the state. They were informed that since FIR had already been registered, a second case could not be registered for the same offence,” Jatoi said.
He added that since then, three other people, who were detained along with Irfan, were released and cleared of any wrongdoing, the family and those gathered believed that the four were “innocent” and were tortured in custody, leading to Irfan’s death. The protesters urged the Sindh chief minister and police chief to provide justice in the matter.
Following the sit-in, thousands were stranded on major thoroughfares as traffic piled up and spilled onto nearby routes.
In a post on X after 10:30pm, Karachi Traffic Police said the road at Edhi Center in Sohrab Goth had reopened for traffic following the conclusion of the protest.
The road linking Sohrab Goth and Rashid Minhas Road was restored to normal traffic flow, according to traffic police officials.
 






Earlier in the evening, Karachi Traffic Police said in a statement that traffic at Edhi Centre Sohrab Goth, towards Shafiq Mor main Rashid Minhas Road was closed for traffic.

FIR
The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on Wednesday. A day ago, the SIU had told Dawn that they were arrested from Ayesha Manzil in the FB Area of the city.
The FIR added they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI).
SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating office of the case that two other ASIs had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious.
The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion.</p><small>2025-10-25 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251058041b1a071.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951149/pakistan-afghanistan-seek-to-firm-up-truce-in-istanbul-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan seek to firm up truce in Istanbul talks</strong></a><br><p>A second round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan kicked off in Istanbul on Saturday, with Islamabad eyeing a “concrete” mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
Today’s meeting follows the first round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19.
The Qatar talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border — where trade is still closed — and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. The agreement reached in Doha extended an initial 48-hour truce and resulted in a permanent ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
 


According to Afghan interim administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan delegation was to be led by Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb, deputy minister at Ministry of Interior, Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.
Islamabad has not said who it has sent to the talks. It was also not clear where exactly the negotiators were meeting in Turkey’s largest city, nor how long the talks would continue.
“The remaining issues [with Pakistan] will be discussed in the meeting,” Mujahid said in a post on X last night, adding that the Afghan delegation had left Kabul for Istanbul.
 


“Pakistan looks forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye in Istanbul on Oct 25, 2025, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan and prevent any further loss of life of Pakistanis,” the new Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said at his maiden weekly media briefing yesterday.
In essence, Doha produced the political breakthrough, while Istanbul is expected to operationalise it by defining what constitutes cross-border terrorism, how violations will be verified and how disputes will be resolved.
The Istanbul round offers an opportunity to move from temporary calm towards a structured, verifiable peace framework with mechanisms for monitoring, verification and sustained dialogue through technical committees.
Turkish officials have indicated that a technical committee in Istanbul will review details of the ceasefire, inc­l­uding terrorism, migration and border security.
At the talks today, Pakistan is expected to seek concrete and verifiable commitments from the Afghan side to eliminate the threat of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from its territory, which Pakistan says uses Afghan soil to launch attacks across the border.
The agenda includes dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad plans to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing.
Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
 
 

Additional priorities will include securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.
The truce agreed in Doha has largely held, with no major terrorist attacks reported since, according to the FO.
 


“We are taking part in the second round of talks in Istanbul with the same sincerity of purpose, with the same sincerity of intent with which we participated in Doha,” Andrabi said yesterday.
“During the Doha talks, the basic focus was to stop the terrorist attacks from Afghan soil into Pakistan.
“And in order to do that, we should have a verifiable, empirical mechanism to ascertain that the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul is taking concrete actions to stop such attacks,” the FO spokesperson said.
He said the continuation of the ceasefire demonstrated the progress achieved in Doha.
“In effect, the Doha talks and outcomes were fruitful. We would like the trend to continue in Istanbul and post-Istanbul,” Andrabi added.
Khawaja Asif warns of ‘open war’ with Afghanistan if peace talks fail
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said he believes Afghanistan wants peace but that failure to reach an agreement during talks in Istanbul would mean “open war”.
Asif said there had been no incidents in the four to five days since the ceasefire was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce.
“We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them,” he said, adding: “But I saw that they want peace.”
‘Turkiye trusted partner’
Turkiye’s deep counterterrorism experience against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its familiarity with insurgent challenges along porous borders give Ankara both diplomatic credibility and practical insight into Pakistan’s difficulties with TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Its role is further strengthened by the longstanding Pakistan-Turkiye counterterrorism cooperation, including consultations held earlier this year.
For Pakistan, Turkiye represents a trusted partner capable of designing a mechanism that both sides can rely on, shifting the peace process from ad hoc diplomacy to institutionalised peace-building.
 
 

Ibraheem Bahiss, an International Crisis Group analyst in Afghanistan, termed the meeting “quite essential”. He told AFP that monitoring “mechanisms” could involve intelligence sharing on armed groups.
“For example, Pakistan would give coordinates of where they suspect TTP fighters or commanders are, and instead of carrying out strikes, Afghanistan would be expected to carry out action against them,” Bahiss said.
But it was unclear if that would end the problem. “I’m not so hopeful that a technical mechanism will really address the fundamental drivers of this escalatory cycle,” he said.

“​The restrictions are effective from Tuesday, October 28, 2025, at 5:01am Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) and will remain in place until Wednesday, October 29, 2025, at 9am PKT,” said a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued by the PAA today.
​
“This is a routine operational safety matter. The measure is being implemented for ‘operational reasons’ to ensure the continued safety and effective management of air traffic.”
In a separate development, open source tracker Damien Symon, also quoted by Reuters in earlier news reports, said Indian aviation authorities issued a NOTAM a day earlier “possibly for a military exercise/weapons test as India prepares for its Tri-Services Exercise across the border”.
 






The open source tracker stated that India had also issued a NOTAM for a tri-services exercise along its western border with Pakistan from October 30 to November 10, saying the “chosen area and scale of activity are unusual”.
A map he shared showed that the exercise area extends from around the Indian city of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to the disputed Sir Creek marsh area.
The creek area has been a point of contention for decades between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and talks on the maritime boundary dispute have remained inconclusive thus far.
 






Indian news outlet Firstpost also reported that NOTAM was for a “large-scale tri-services exercise” along the Pakistan border “amid rising tensions following Operation Sindoor”.
It added that the exercise will involve the three branches of the Indian military and is aimed at demonstrating the country’s “growing joint operational capabilities, self-reliance and innovation”.
It quoted the Indian defence ministry as saying that “troops from Southern Command will actively participate to validate joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational exercises encompassing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber capabilities.“
CNBC-TV18 reported that as per officials, the exercise underscores India’s commitment to enhancing interoperability among its armed forces while “strengthening preparedness for future combat scenarios”.
Firstpost reported that Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had visited soldiers in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, on Thursday and claimed Operation Sindoor had “sent a strong warning to Pakistan, which would now ‘think twice before attempting any misadventure against India’”.
 






India Today reported that he had also visited the Bhuj Military Station in Gujarat the same day and warned Pakistan against any action in the disputed Sir Creek area.
“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” the outlet quoted him as saying.
We know how to defend every inch of our maritime frontiers: Naval chief
Separately, a press release from the Pakistan Navy said Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf visited forward posts in the creek areas to review operational preparedness and combat readiness.
The naval chief said sea lines of communication (SLOCs) and maritime security were not just a military requirement but a “cornerstone” of the nation’s sovereignty and a “vital pillar” of economic prosperity and stability.
 






He emphasised that the navy PN was the “vanguard of peace and stability” in the Indian Ocean and a “significant stakeholder” in regional maritime security.
“We know how to defend our sovereignty and every inch of our maritime frontiers from Sir Creek to Jiwani,” he added.
He also reaffirmed to the nation that the navy’s defence capabilities stood “as strong as our unwavering morale, from the shores to the sea”.
During the visit, three state-of-the-art 2400 TD Hovercraft were also inducted into the Pak Marines, marking a “significant stride” in modernising the navy’s operational capabilities.
“The newly inducted hovercraft are capable of simultaneously operating over a variety of surfaces, including shallow waters, sand dunes, marshy and boggy littoral zones, and can ply in areas where traditional craft are neither suitable nor designed to operate. This unique capability of undertaking simultaneous operations over land and sea provides an edge to Pak Marines in the performance of their assigned tasks. It will also strengthen PN’s capabilities for an effective and decisive response against all adversaries.
“While addressing officers and men on the occasion, naval chief highlighted that the induction of these new platforms symbolizes PN’s vision to modernise and reaffirm unwavering resolve in bolstering defence of the country’s maritime frontiers, coastal belt particularly the creeks area.”
Pakistan-India tensions
Earlier in the week, United States President Donald Trump stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”.
The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Since then, Indian political and military leadership, including chiefs of the military branches, have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted and also warning of “geographical changes” in the course of any future conflict.
Singh had also said on May 30 that India would use the firepower of its navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan, Reuters reported.
The Pakistani military has dismissed the statements as India attempting to “mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts” in the aftermath of the May conflict while also issuing warnings of its own that any “imaginary new normal” the Indian leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,“ the military had said earlier in October.</p><small>2025-10-25 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2519073025fd8bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951176/cm-afridi-demands-centre-pay-rs550bn-to-kp-calls-for-immediate-nfc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi demands Centre pay Rs550bn to KP, calls for immediate NFC meeting</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday claimed the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, calling for the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting to be convened immediately.
He made these remarks while addressing a jirga in the province’s Khyber district today. Last week, CM Afridi had called for a grand peace jirga in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province.
“After 9/11, Pakistan entered a foreign war without our consent,” CM Afridi said, referring to the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, when deadly plane hijackings claimed almost 3,000 lives.
“It was said that Pakistan needs sacrifices. For Pakistan, we left our houses. Drone strikes and military operations started here,” Afridi said.
“We were made the scapegoats,” he told the crowd. “Our homes, markets, and mosques were destroyed, yet we gave sacrifices for Pakistan.”
 






The chief minister warned against the launching of any new military operation in the province’s tribal districts, saying the people will “not be made into scapegoats again”.
Afridi added that despite the claims of security forces in 2018 that Khyber district and other tribal areas had been cleared [of militants], “preparations are again being made for new military operations”.
The newly elected provincial chief executive said KP stands with the state when it comes to peace, but “under no circumstance will we support collateral damage”.
“If any innocent life is lost this time, there will be accountability,” Afridi said.
He also demanded that any future decisions regarding the region “must include the provincial government and parliamentarians from KP,” rejecting decisions made behind “closed doors”.
PTI leadership meet at CM House
Prior to the jirga, a meeting of PTI’s senior leadership took place at CM House in Peshawar, according to a statement by press secretary to CM Sahibzada Hassan.
Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar, CM Sohail Afridi, PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar, Asad Qaiser and other leaders participated in the meeting, per the statement. The law and order situation of the province was discussed in detail during the meeting.
 






It was decided to convene a peace jirga in the KP Assembly, with former CMs, governors, scholars, jirga leaders, civil society, lawyers and important personalities to be invited.
“The aim of the peace jirga is to eliminate terrorism and formulate a unified strategy for sustainable peace,” said the statement. “Participants of the meeting paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police.’
“Provincial government stands by the police force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. “Providing modern equipment, training and resources to the police is the top priority of the government.”
Rise in terrorist incidents
Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel.
Earlier this week, Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.</p><small>2025-10-25 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25221451d820598.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951189/narcotics-worth-more-than-rs18bn-seized-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Narcotics worth more than Rs18bn seized in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The Customs Enforcement Wing of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) foiled on Saturday an attempt to smuggle a large quantity of narcotics worth more than Rs18 billion.
 






The enforcement wing, in a post on X, said a truck coming from Taftan and going towards Quetta was intercepted by a team of FEU Noshki. “Upon detailed inspection, a modified fuel tank was found containing concealed boxes filled with narcotics substance.”
At least 300kg of crystal meth (methamphetamine) was seized from the vehicle, said the enforcement wing. It added that two individuals, resident of Hoshab in Kech, were arrested. “FIR has been registered. Further investigation is underway.”
“300 kg of Crystal/Ice (Methamphetamine) and the smuggling vehicle have been seized both valuing at approximately Rs. 18.67 billion.”

A statement issued today from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that security forces foiled a “major terrorist incident and averted a potential catastrophic attack” a day ago after conducting an intelligence-based operation  (IBO) in the district’s general area of Jhallar based on credible intelligence about reported terrorist presence belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij preparing a vehicle-borne suicide bomber for a major terrorist activity”.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It added that troops effectively engaged them at their location and destroyed the vehicle being prepared for the suicide attack while eliminating three “Indian-sponsored” terrorists through “precise and skillful engagement”.
 






The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.
“Relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.

The incident happened in the central Indian city of Indore on Thursday morning when the two players left their hotel to go to a cafe, a day after Australia’s six-wicket victory over England in the group stage of the World Cup, when they were allegedly approached by a motorcyclist.
“The security officers of the women’s Australian cricket team filed a complaint that two members of the team faced inappropriate behaviour,” additional deputy commissioner of police, Rajesh Dandotiya, told Indian news agency ANI.
“A FIR (first information report) was registered, and the accused was identified and arrested following an intensive strategic operation.”
He has been charged under sections 74 and 78 of the criminal code that deal with assault or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty and stalking, respectively. “We are examining if there were any shortfalls in the security protocols,” Dandotiya added.
Violence against women remains a chronic issue in the world’s most populous country, where an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022.
Dandotiya said the 30-year-old man who was arrested has a criminal record.
The two players were not identified by Indian police or Cricket Australia, which confirmed the incident.
“The matter was reported by team security to police, who are handling the matter,” Cricket Australia said in a statement.
Board of Control for Cricket in India Secretary Devajit Saikia said it was a “deeply regrettable and isolated incident.
“We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served,” Saikia said.
“We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”
The Times of India newspaper reported that the team’s security manager received a distress message from one of the cricketers that said “… there is a guy following us trying to grab us”.
Team officials were informed and went to their location to assist the players, the paper said.
A police patrol then escorted the players safely back to the team’s hotel.

It added that continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country, bringing generally dry weather, while hilly areas were expected to remain cold during morning and night hours. Citizens were advised to take precautionary measures against the prevailing smog.
Lahore was declared the world’s most polluted city earlier this week as a hazardous blanket of smog enveloped the metropolis, prompting authorities to issue a severe public health warning.
Along with Karachi, the city was among the top five most polluted cities in terms of air quality, according to monitoring platform IQAir.
Smog is set to intensify across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.

He made the remarks during a ceremony at the Islamabad International Airport to mark the national flag carrier’s inaugural flight from the capital to the United Kingdom (UK) after a gap of nearly five years.
Last month, the airline had received Third Country Operator approval for the UK. The development came after Britain’s Department of Transport concluded that security arrangements in the country were “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Flight operations to Manchester are resuming in the first phase, with plans to extend them to Birmingham and London in the second.
“After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Asif said.
“This success is not a coincidence, but a living testament of the government’s priorities, strong leadership, and efforts,” he said. The minister said that the country’s image suffered immensely when the national carrier faced international bans.
 






“We took it as a national challenge. The government, without wasting a single moment, empowered and provided resources to the country’s aviation bodies,” he said.
“To meet the standards of the world’s strictest aviation bodies, we completely restructured pilot training, the licensing system, aircraft maintenance, and safety protocols,” he added.
“It is a matter of great pride that we raised our standards to such a level that the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) restored its confidence in PIA,“ the minister said.
Asif also expressed gratitude to Pakistani diplomats and staff based in Britain and Europe, saying that they “presented Pakistan’s case effectively at a diplomatic level, provided evidence, and maintained continuous engagement” with the relevant authorities.
He said that their persistent efforts had enabled the national carrier to resume its regular flight operations.
“I would especially like to thank the staff of the British High Commission in Pakistan and their team leader Jane Marriott,” he said, adding that they also played a part in accelerating the process and removing obstacles.
“Their cooperation highlights the strong friendship between the two countries,” he said. The minister added that the government was committed to making PIA a profitable institution so that it could support the economy instead of being a burden.
The minister said that the flights to Manchester were an “excellent start” but the government would not stop there. “We plan that after Manchester, flights to London and Birmingham will also be started,” he said.
The minister directed the PIA management to ensure safety, punctuality and customer satisfaction. “Let us vow today to make PIA reach the status it had once achieved,” he said.
In a post on X, Asif said the restoration of flights was part of a series of measures taken by the government for the restoration of national institutions, improvement of public facilities, and the promotion of Pakistan’s image at the international level.
 






He said that the statement of the aviation minister during the PTI era “caused damage to the reputation of our beloved country, the aviation sector, and the national airline PIA, which the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has rectified”.
“The resumption of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester marks the beginning of a new era of connectivity between Pakistan and the UK, which will provide significant convenience to the Pakistani community residing there,” Asif said.
Meanwhile, Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said: “A genuine joy to wave off the first flight by a Pakistani carrier to the UK in five years. Here’s to more destinations and connections!”
 






PM Shehbaz felicitated the nation, especially Pakistanis residing in the UK, on the commencement of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester.
The prime minister also lauded the efforts of Asif, the Civil Aviation Authority, PIA and the officials of the relevant entities in this regard.
“Pakistans image is being restored across the world,” he said, adding that the suspension had damaged PIAs reputation, which was now restored after years of dedicated efforts.
The prime minister further observed that the Pakistani community living in the UK would greatly benefit from these direct flights.
“The resumption of direct flights will further strengthen Pakistan-UK bilateral ties,” he said, adding that the journey of improvement in every national institution, through reforms, was progressing at a rapid pace.
 






The EASA had barred PIA from operating in EU countries in June 2020 over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near the Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers.
The ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament terming pilots’ licences “dubious”.
EASA lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28 last year. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
It should also be mentioned that the government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.</p><small>2025-10-25 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251702134670033.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951182/coas-munir-egypts-sisi-stress-coordination-on-matters-of-mutual-strategic-interest' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir, Egypt’s Sisi stress coordination on matters of mutual strategic interest</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el‑Sisi stressed on Saturday the need for further coordination between their countries on matters of mutual strategic interest.
Pakistan and Egypt share long-standing bilateral relations. In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Last week, Pak­istan and Egypt agreed to enhance cooperation in the maritime and industrial sectors, aiming to foster joint ventures and promote their blue economies. The army chief is currently on a visit to the country.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief held a meeting with the Egyptian president at the Itihadia Presidential Palace in Cairo.
 
 

“COAS commended the Egyptian leadership for key role in the region’s peace and stability, while President el-Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s positive and proactive contributions to matters of importance for the world and Muslim ummah. Both leaders underlined the importance of coordination on matters of mutual strategic interests and strengthening people-to-people contacts,” the ISPR said.
It added that both exchanged views on bilateral relations and reaffirmed the long-standing friendship between Pakistan and Egypt.
“The meeting further acknowledged the shared history of friendly ties and the mutual desire to further broaden cooperation in all domains especially socio-economic engagement, technology and security matters.”
“The meeting concluded on a warm note, with both parties expressing confidence that the strengthened economic and security dialogue would contribute significantly to peace, stability and security in Pakistan, Egypt and the wider region,” the ISPR said.
The army chief had reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt in a meeting with its defence officials a day ago.
The army chief had also visited and laid a floral wreath on the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier and the grave of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also met the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayab.</p><small>2025-10-25 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25123421d563ea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951154/more-than-60-un-members-sign-cybercrime-treaty-opposed-by-rights-groups' target='_blank'><strong>More than 60 UN members sign cybercrime treaty opposed by rights groups</strong></a><br><p>Countries signed their first United Nations (UN) treaty targeting cybercrime in Hanoi on Saturday, despite opposition from an unlikely band of tech companies and rights groups warning of expanded state surveillance.
The new global legal framework aims to strengthen international cooperation to fight digital crimes, from child pornography to transnational cyberscams and money laundering.
More than 60 countries were seen to sign the declaration on Saturday, which means it will go into force once ratified by those states.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the signing as an “important milestone”, but that it was “only the beginning”.
“Every day, sophisticated scams destroy families, steal migrants and drain billions of dollars from our economy… We need a strong, connected global response,” he said at the opening ceremony in Vietnam’s capital on Saturday.
The UN Convention against Cybercrime was first proposed by Russian diplomats in 2017, and approved by consensus last year after lengthy negotiations.
Critics say its broad language could lead to abuses of power and enable the cross-border repression of government critics.
“There were multiple concerns raised throughout the negotiation of the treaty around how it actually ends up compelling companies to share data,” said Sabhanaz Rashid Diya, founder of the Tech Global Institute think tank.
“It’s almost rubber-stamping a very problematic practice that has been used against journalists and in authoritarian countries,” she told AFP.
‘Weak’ safeguards
Vietnam’s government said this week that 60 countries were registered for the official signing, without disclosing which ones.
But the list will probably not be limited to Russia, China, and their allies.
“Cybercrime is a real issue across the world,” Diya said. “I think everybody’s kind of grappling with it.”
The far-reaching online scam industry, for example, has ballooned in Southeast Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved and victims worldwide conned out of billions of dollars annually.
“Even for the most democratic states, I think they need some degree of access to data that they’re not getting under existing mechanisms,” Diya told AFP.
Democratic countries might describe the UN convention as a “compromise document”, as it contains some human rights provisions, she added.
But these safeguards were slammed as “weak” in a letter signed by more than a dozen rights groups and other organisations.
Tech sector
Big technology companies have also raised concerns.
The Cybersecurity Tech Accord delegation to the treaty talks, representing more than 160 firms including Meta, Dell and India’s Infosys, will not be present in Hanoi, its head Nick Ashton-Hart said.
Among other objections, those companies previously warned that the convention could criminalise cybersecurity researchers and “allows states to cooperate on almost any criminal act they choose”.
Potential overreach by authorities poses “serious risks to corporate IT systems relied upon by billions of people every day”, they said during the negotiation process.
In contrast, an existing international accord, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, includes guidance on using it in a “rights-respecting” way, Ashton-Hart said.
The location for the signing has also raised eyebrows, given Vietnam’s record of crackdowns on dissent.
“Vietnamese authorities typically use laws to censor and silence any online expression of views critical of the country’s political leadership,” said Deborah Brown of Human Rights Watch.
“Russia has been a driving force behind this treaty and will certainly be pleased once it’s signed,” she told AFP.
“But a significant amount of cybercrime globally comes from Russia, and it has never needed a treaty to tackle cybercrime from within its borders,” Brown added.
“This treaty can’t make up Russia’s lack of political will in that regard.”</p><small>2025-10-25 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251418527f6422b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951157/3-suspected-robbers-killed-in-shootout-with-quetta-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 suspected robbers killed in shootout with Quetta police</strong></a><br><p>Three suspected robbers were killed in a shootout with police in Quetta’s outskirts on Saturday morning, an official said.
Saddar Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Shaukat Jadoon told Dawn.com that three armed suspects opened fire on a police patrol party in the Killi Khali area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta, within the limits of the Brewery Police Station.
“All three suspects were killed during the police’s retaliatory action,” DSP Jadoon said.
“Weapons were recovered from the possession of the dacoits,” the officer said, adding that their bodies were taken to the Bolan Medical College for medico-legal procedures.
The suspects were dacoits and were present in the area with the intention of committing a robbery, the DSP said. Further police investigation was being carried out, he added.
Last month, Sala­h­u­ddin Achakzai, a prominent tribal elder of the Achakzai tribe, was shot dead and two others were injured when arm­ed men riding motorcycles targeted them on the outskirts of Chaman.
In late August, two men were gunned down when armed men opened fire on their car near Killi Dargai on Loralai-Dera Road.

Addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad today, PM Shehabz recalled various challenges faced by the people of Balochistan. Noting that some of those challenges required financial resources, the premier recalled meetings in Lahore held ahead of the 2009 National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, which he had attended as the then-Punjab chief minister.
“I would like to mention in all humility that in Lahore, all four chief ministers were gathered together, along with their finance ministers. Three days’ marathon session went on without a break — of course, when night fell, we would go for a few hours’ rest and then gather the next morning again.”
He noted that then-Balochistan CM Aslam Raisani had conditioned the acceptance of the NFC Award on “100 per cent financial resources being added to Balochistan’s share”.
“I said Punjab is ready to contribute whatever amount is required to meet my brother Aslam Raisani’s demand, and this is what we call the true spirit of a federation and what we call four brothers living under a roof,” PM Shehbaz said.
 
 

“The question now is how to meet these challenges so that the people of Balochistan — Baloch, Pashtun and all other communities living there — should not only own Pakistan but also feel like active participants and beneficiaries of economic growth.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the issues of Balochistan “will persist tomorrow as well, but to resolve them, one thing should come first; that Pakistan is our home and we have to put out the fire together”.
During his address, PM Shehbaz highlighted that Balochistan “voluntarily joined Pakistan”, terming the event “something history will always remember in golden words”.
He noted that the province was blessed with “infinite natural resources, which run into trillions and trillions of dollars”. “But unfortunately, those great natural resources of wealth and still hidden and buried under tonnes of mud and mountains,” the premier lamented.
“Unfortunately, what has happened in the last few years, rather spanning over more than a decade, is a matter of self-introspection,” the prime minister said.
 


Throughout his speech, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for unity among the people of all provinces.
“Baloch people have always been very, very generous to those segments of society who either migrated to Quetta or were living there for ages. Pashtuns, of course, are a part of Balochistan, Punjabi migrants and then other tribes living in Balochistan too,” he asserted.
“There was complete harmony and peace existed between the early segments of society for a very long time,” the prime minister highlighted.
He further said: “When I speak of Balochistan’s brothers, sisters and children, I am not referring to any geographical division, because we are Pakistanis first, then Punjabis, Baloch, Sindhis or Pashtuns.
“What happened then that distance developed between us, and complaints and grievances came into existence even though terrorism had been completely eradicated in Pakistan in 2018,” he said, terming it a “piercing” question that needed to be answered.
PM Shehbaz went on to recall that the Regional Cooperation for Development Highway (also known as N-25), which connects Karachi to Chaman, was infamously known as the khooni road (killer highway) in Balochistan due to “accidents that occur every other day there”.
The prime minister highlighted his government’s decision in April this year to divert money saved from reduced oil prices to development projects in Balochistan by skipping providing relief to fuel consumers.
 
 

“This killer road has a [reconstruction] estimate of Rs300bn-350bn,” he said, adding that the petrol and diesel prices declined by about Rs8-10 per litre. “I calculated so it amounted to Rs180 billion per year. If I retain that, then this killer road can be turned into a road of peace.
“My sole reason for this decision was harmony, bringing together provincial affection and promoting unity […] These are the decisions through which Pakistan can definitely come out of these challenges,” the premier asserted.</p><small>2025-10-25 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251105396e09ad6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951150/trump-slams-dirty-canada-despite-withdrawal-of-anti-tariff-advertisement' target='_blank'><strong>Trump slams ‘dirty’ Canada despite withdrawal of anti-tariff advertisement</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump slammed Canada for playing “dirty” on Friday as a row over an advertisement featuring former leader Ronald Reagan that prompted Trump to scrap trade talks showed no sign of abating.
The Canadian province of Ontario said it would pull the offending anti-tariff ad on Monday so that negotiations could restart, after Trump alleged that the ad misrepresented the views of fellow Republican Reagan.
 






But Trump showed no sign of backing down, saying Ontario should not have let it air during the first two games this weekend of baseball’s World Series.
Adding extra spice to the row, the World Series features a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, facing a US team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays thrashed the Dodgers 11-4 in the first game on Friday.
“Canada got caught cheating on a commercial, can you believe it?” Trump told reporters before heading on a trip to Asia.
“And I heard they were pulling the ad — I didn’t know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight,” Trump added.
After a reporter said the ad would be pulled on Monday, Trump replied: “That’s dirty play. But I can play dirtier than they can.”
 






Trump announced on his Truth Social network on Thursday that he had “terminated” all negotiations with Canada over what he called the “fake” ad campaign.
Less than 24 hours later, Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the ads after talking to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about the spiraling row with Washington.
“In speaking with Prime Minister Carney, Ontario will pause its US advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,” Ford said in a post on X.
 






‘Crooked ad’
The Canadian ad used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.
It cited Reagan as saying that “high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.
The Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used “selective audio and video” and that it was reviewing its legal options.
 






Trump said on Friday night that it was a “crooked ad”, adding that “they know Ronald Reagan loved tariffs”.
Trump and Carney are both set to be at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea on Wednesday.
But Trump said he had no plans to meet Carney.
The latest twist in relations between the United States and Canada came just over two weeks after Carney visited Trump at the White House to seek a relaxation of stiff US tariffs.
On Friday, Carney had sought to calm the situation, saying that his country was ready to resume “progress” on trade talks “when the Americans are ready”.
Canada has “to focus on what we can control, and realize what we cannot control,” he added as he headed to Asia.
Trump’s global sectoral tariffs — particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos — have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.
For now, the United States and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.
But in a speech on Wednesday, Carney said that the United States has raised “its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression”.
“Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,” Carney added, saying the process “will take some sacrifices and some time.”</p><small>2025-10-25 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251056566dd34dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951148/thailands-former-queen-sirikit-dead-at-93-palace' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s former queen Sirikit dead at 93: palace</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s former Queen Sirikit, the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch, died late on Friday at the age of 93, the palace said.
The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Throughout her 66-year marriage to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Sirikit carved a dual reputation as a fashionista and the nation’s caring matriarch — with some Western media featuring her on magazine covers and comparing her to former US first lady Jackie Kennedy.
“I had heard that she had been unwell and, given that she was in her 90s, I knew this day would come,” 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit said early on Saturday in the capital Bangkok.
“But I didn’t expect it to be today,” Sasis told AFP.
“I feel sad because she was a mother figure to the country, and now she’s gone.”
Sirikit had “suffered several illnesses” while hospitalised since 2019, including a blood infection this month, the palace said in a statement.
“Her majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away … at Chulalongkorn hospital at age 93,” it added.
King Vajiralongkorn has assigned members of the royal family to begin a year-long mourning period, the palace said.
From early on Saturday, Thai news anchors were seen wearing black during the morning broadcast, a sign of public mourning.
Her passing “marks a profoundly significant event for the Thai Royal Family and the entire nation, given her immense popularity and deep connection to the late king who remains deeply revered”, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, told AFP.
Pakistan offers condolences
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “deep sorrow” at the former queen’s passing and conveyed his condolences to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at Sirikit’s passing.
“The people and government of Pakistan join me in extending our deepest condolences to His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time of national grief,” he said.
 






‘Mother of the Nation’
King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s remarkably lengthy reign from 1946 until 2016 was bookended by World War II and the first inauguration of US President Donald Trump.
Though Bhumibol’s son inherited the throne about nine years ago, many still revere him as the nation’s most steadfast figurehead — and Sirikit as his constant companion.
She retired from the public eye in recent years as she suffered from ailing health, her privacy sealed by strict lese majeste laws that limit what can be reported about the royal family.
But in her glamorous heyday in the 1960s she mingled with US presidents and superstars such as Elvis Presley, while at home touring Thailand to visit villagers in rural areas.
She was referred to as the “Mother of the Nation” and her birthday was designated the country’s Mothers’ Day.
The reigning Chakri dynasty dates back to 1782 but the succession from King Vajiralongkorn is unclear as he has not formally named an heir.
He has seven children including five sons — four from an earlier marriage who have been officially disowned, and his 20-year-old son Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.
While the royal family is still held in very high regard by most Thais, it faced unprecedented public dissent during street protests in 2020.
Tens of thousands of young protesters took to the streets demanding widespread political reforms including changes to the monarchy — a public challenge to the royals’ status never seen in Thailand before.
Though Thailand’s constitution places the monarchy above politics, Sirikit drew public attention when she attended the funeral of a royalist protester in 2008.
When her husband King Bhumibol died, Thailand observed a year-long mourning period.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital Bangkok, according to the palace.</p><small>2025-10-25 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25083820c4bd6e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951100/modi-backtracks-on-malaysia-visit-for-asean-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Modi backtracks on Malaysia visit for Asean summit</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia at the weekend to attend an Asean-related summit, joining the discussions “virtually” instead, it was officially announced on Friday.
The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans.
The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said.
 



Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump

The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump.
Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”.
“The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said.
“It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re,” he added.
 


In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said.
 






“Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement.
 






In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi.
“He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.”
The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil.
The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation.
It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call.
Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.
