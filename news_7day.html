Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana.
He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”.
Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”.
“If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”.
He added that “if you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution”.
Bilawal maintained had there been PPP in PTI’s place, the consequences it would have had to face would have been more severe.
He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not be better for the party itself and its works, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics.
The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, but President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation.
“From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role.
“President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said.
However, he pointed out, there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances. “The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance.
“If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.”
He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss.
In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held.
“And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that — we will have to increase people’s trust in the election commission.
“There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said.
Referring to the complaints with regards to the recently held by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”.
Again highlighting the need for opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have take some measures.
“Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added.

The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”.
The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.







Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.
Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy.
They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory.
“The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read.
They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”.
In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty.
Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans.







While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”.
However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.”
“Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.</p><small>2025-12-28 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2812334599cdb57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963727/govt-declares-youtuber-adil-raja-proscribed-person-under-anti-terrorism-law' target='_blank'><strong>Govt declares YouTuber Adil Raja proscribed person under anti-terrorism law</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government has declared YouTuber Adil Farooq Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and currently resides in the United Kingdom, a proscribed person under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
“The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Adil Farooq Raja has been demonstrating his sustained involvement in activities posing a serious threat to the security, integrity, and public order of Pakistan.
“He has consistently misused online platforms to promote, facilitate, and amplify anti-state narratives and propaganda associated with proscribed terrorist organisations, thereby acting in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and defence of Pakistan,” read the notification declaring the YouTuber a proscribed person.
The notification was issued by the interior ministry and is dated December 27.
It said, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 11ee of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, the federal government is pleased to direct to list Mr Adil Farooq Raja in the Fourth Schedule to the said Act as a proscribed person for the purposes of the said Act.”
The notification was issued after the federal cabinet approved the summary for Raja‘s proscription, the summary for which had been submitted by the interior ministry on December 23.
The development came roughly 20 days after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi handed over the extradition papers for Raja — who has positioned himself as a whistleblower — former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar to UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott.
Prior to that, Naqvi had announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions.
Raja had reacted to the development in a post on X, saying: “They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing.”
On December 10, Raja had also been ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference.
In 2023, Raja was handed 14 years of jail sentence following his Field General Court Martial for “inciting sedition” and stripped of his military rank.
While the military’s media affairs wing did not directly link the convictions to the events of May 9, Raja and Mehdi had been accused by the Islamabad police of playing a significant role in fomenting rebellion and inciting attacks on military installations during widespread protests that followed PTI leader Imran Khan’s arrest on that day.</p><small>2025-12-28 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2813470560b2cf1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963728/zelensky-to-meet-trump-in-florida-for-talks-on-ukraine-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Zelensky to meet Trump in Florida for talks on Ukraine peace plan</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to hammer out a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and provocations from Russian air attacks.
Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts.
Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.
The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X.
“Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage.







Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce.
The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.
Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.
Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.
Sticking points over territory
Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.
While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.
The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.
Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025.
Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.
Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato.
Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members.
The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.
Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.
Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv
Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”.
“The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities.







Zelensky said he would speak with European leaders again after he meets with Trump.</p><small>2025-12-28 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69507190c773c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963571/smokers-corner-pakistans-permanent-grey-zone' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: PAKISTAN'S PERMANENT GREY ZONE?</strong></a><br><p>While the concept of the ‘hybrid regime’ traces its origins back to 1970, it was formally solidified in modern political science during the 1990s as a scholarly response to the ‘Third Wave of Democratisation’.
This global surge of democratic transitions was part of a framework postulated by the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. He categorised the global spread of democracy into three distinct historical periods: an initial wave beginning in the mid-1800s that stalled due to the rising tide of authoritarianism in the 1920s/30s; a second wave triggered by the end of World War II and lasting till the early 1960s; and a third wave beginning in the 1990s but one that prompted the hybrid classification, because many transitioning states remained suspended in a grey zone between full democracy and autocracy.
By the mid-2000s, a democratic recession marked by significant backsliding became evident, as many emerging democracies failed to consolidate and, instead, adopted hybrid models. While Western scholars often interpret this as a symptom of decline, an alternative perspective suggests the model acts as a vital deterrence against outright authoritarianism.
In Pakistan, the hybrid model’s legacy dates back to the late 1950s, when Gen Ayub Khan abrogated the Constitution and imposed the country’s first martial law. Gen Ayub transitioned from overt martial law to a ‘controlled democracy’ in 1962. Cornered by a powerful pro-democracy movement, Ayub was forced to resign in 1969, even though, the fact is, he only really did so after losing the institutional backing of his own institution — the military. As Stephen Cohen notes, this period deeply embedded militarism into Pakistan’s political fabric.

Pakistan’s hybrid regime has hardened into a lasting political order, where political parties and civilian leaders exist within carefully managed limits

Following the end of Gen Ziaul Haq’s military rule in 1988, this militarism evolved from direct intervention towards informal systemic control. This strategy was then refined after the 2008 collapse of Gen Pervez Musharraf’s military regime. The military establishment (ME) started to seek compatible civilian partners to formulate a sturdy hybrid system.
However, the refined model faced immediate challenges in the form of a struggling economy, Islamist militancy, and the resurgence of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). These two had a history of strained relations with the ME. After the 2008 elections, these parties successfully ousted Gen Musharraf, leading to heightened civil-military tensions.
Consequently, by 2010, the ME began cultivating Imran Khan as a ‘third alternative’, designed to be the centrepiece of a more manageable hybrid arrangement. Despite the PML-N’s landslide victory in 2013, the ME bolstered Khan’s populist street agitation by aligning the judiciary, media and wealthy donors behind his ‘cause’. The objective was to neutralise the PPP and PML-N with a ‘popular’ civilian frontman who would be easier to manage. This project reached its zenith in 2018, when Khan became prime minister.
But the project quickly unravelled, due to Khan’s lack of administrative experience and his inability to transition out of movement mode and mindset. He eventually became so enamoured with the state-sponsored narrative of his own popularity that he viewed himself as indestructible, even as governance declined. He began being seen as a liability by the ME, before being ousted in 2022 through an act of parliament.
So why did the ME persist with the hybrid model after the collapse of the Khan regime?



For the new ME leadership under Gen Asim Munir, the failure was one of personnel, not policy. The consensus seemed to be that many of Khan’s backers in the ME had been seduced by his populist appeal, neglecting the practicalities of governance and international relations. In the eyes of the new ME, the model was sound but had been poorly implemented by a civilian agent and his handlers, who were unable to manage the complexities of power.
Refining its approach, the new ME sought to recalibrate the hybrid model. It is likely that, by examining ‘successful’ hybrid systems in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Russia, the ME opted to repair its fractured relationships with PML-N and the PPP. The goal was to replace the volatile populism of the previous hybrid model with a more pragmatic outlook, and action.

 

Due to their inherent adaptability, the durability of ‘successful’ hybrid regimes often surpasses that of rigid authoritarianism. By maintaining a degree of institutional flexibility, such as permitting elections or limited press freedom, hybrid regimes allow social frustrations to be vented without jeopardising their core authority.
Furthermore, the inclusion of opposition parties within parliamentary structures serves as a strategic tool for co-optation, effectively neutralising dissent by integrating potential dissenters into the state framework. Iranian political scientist Vida Yaghouti argues that, by incorporating elements of democratic participation, hybrid regimes diffuse social friction and effectively manage violent uprisings against the regime.
This strategic flexibility is bolstered by the preservation of established bureaucratic and security apparatuses, which function as stabilising anchors during bouts of economic instability or civil unrest. The centralisation of executive and legislative authority in hybrid regimes enables rapid policy formulation. By bypassing the deliberative processes inherent in traditional democracies, hybrid regimes can enact legislation and address national emergencies with greater expediency.
By projecting an image of institutional stability and decisive strength, hybrid regimes often present a more compelling profile to international partners than either dictatorships or fledgling, volatile democracies. Advocates of the hybrid model argue that, amidst global democratic backsliding and geopolitical instability, this model is indispensable for navigating complex transitions and sustaining fragile power balances between political and economic elites.
However, there is a counter-argument that posits that the hybrid model is no longer merely transitional. Far from a ‘stop-gap’, intended to guide fledgling democracies toward maturity, the model appears to be solidifying. As international and domestic pressures intensify, the hybrid regime is increasingly becoming a permanent, hardened fixture of the political landscape.
In the contemporary Pakistani landscape, the hybrid model has solidified into an entrenched, centrist-pragmatic and anti-populist apparatus. Within this framework, the ME functions as the primary engine, while civilian leaders are integrated based on their alignment with the system’s strategic goals.
Given current political and economic trajectories, this arrangement is poised to remain the country’s dominant political reality for the foreseeable future.

Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
The decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.







“Such illegal and provocative actions constitute a flagrant violation of international law and not only threaten the peace and stability of the brotherly country of Somalia, but also that of the entire region,” it added.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
“Pakistan reiterates its complete support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, as well as for all efforts aimed at achieving lasting peace and stability in the country,” the FO said.
It added that Pakistan also reiterated its “unequivocal rejection” of any steps aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land under any circumstances.
The Palestinian foreign ministry said on X earlier today that Israel had “previously used the name Somaliland as a destination for the deportation of members of our Palestinian people, especially from the Gaza Strip”.







Pakistan reaffirmed its unwavering support for the Palestinian people in their just struggle for self-determination and for a sovereign, independent Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Egypt, Turkiye, Djibouti and the African Union have condemned Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, and reaffirmed their full support for Somalia’s territorial integrity.

 

Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held phone calls yesterday with his counterparts from Somalia, Turkiye and Djibouti to discuss what they described as dangerous developments in the Horn of Africa.

KARACHI: Seawater along Pakistan’s coast, especially Gwadar, Pasni, Jiwani and Ormara in Balochistan, has turned green by an algal bloom, marine experts reported on Saturday.
However, they declared that the bloom posed no toxic threat.
“Strong winds and ocean currents have pushed large quantities of algae toward near shores, also amassing rotting seaweeds, which has stunk up the beaches,” said Abdul Rahim, Deputy Director at the Gwadar Development Authority, adding the bloom was caused by a single-celled marine organism Noctiluca.
Algal blooms, he explained were rapid growths or gathering of algae in water bodies and they could cause red, brown, green or blue pigmentation in the water, depending on the type of algae.
According to the GDA official, the intensity of these blooms has increased over a decade along Balochistan’s coast.
Earlier, he pointed out, there was one bloom in one or two years but now the region was seeing two to three blooms in a year.
“This is happening all over the world and researchers have linked this change to the rapid warming of oceans, which is providing them with favourable conditions to grow.”
Muhammad Moazzam Khan, Technical Adviser at the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan, said the Noclituca bloom has also spread to neighbouring Iran. “This year, the bloom has started in Pakistani waters in November and spread along the Karachi coast. Currently, it exists in patches along the entire Pakistan coast, especially along the area between Pasni and Jiwani, where it’s dense.”
The occurrence of green blooms, he pointed out, along the coast of Pakistan wasn’t unusual.
“The organisation has been monitoring Noctiluca bloom since 2012 and reported its occurrence every year in winter (between November and February); however, in some years, such blooms are extensive and spread in vast areas along the coast of Pakistan,” he added.
“The winter bloom is a characteristic of the north Arabian Sea. There have been studies conducted by WWF-Pakistan, which indicate that the bloom is triggered by the spread of cold water from upwelling in some part of the Arabian Sea and its spread under the influence of eddy formation during this period,” Mr Khan said, adding: “Linking this bloom with Eutrophication is not scientifically substantiated. Noctiluca scintillans is a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.”
He added: “The current bloom poses no toxic threat, and no associated fish mortality has been reported along the coast. Regular observations since 2012 show that nearly all Noctiluca blooms along the Sindh and Balochistan coasts have been non-toxic.”
In 2017, the Noctiluca bloom was so intense that it covered the entire Arabian Sea, including Iran, Pakistan, India, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, he added.
While the current Noctiluca bloom is being misinterpreted in some reports and wrongly linked to pollution, WWF-Pakistan clarifies that this bloom is a naturally occurring oceanographic phenomenon and is not caused by pollution.
Along Pakistan’s coast, blooms are most often green or orange and can spread extensively depending on seasonal conditions.
Although the organism itself is not green, the colour comes from its internal symbiont, Protoeuglena noctilucae, which enables it to photosynthesize and grow rapidly. Because Noctiluca is naturally bioluminescent, its presence creates the glittering glow reported at night.

The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who enjoyed a heavy workload in the format this year, featuring in a record 34 T20Is — the most by any Pakistan player in a calendar year.
Shadab, 27, last played a T20I for Pakistan in June before undergoing shoulder surgery earlier this year. After completing a successful rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy, the leg-spinning all-rounder is currently in action in Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL), a factor that appears to have aided his return to international contention.
While Babar and Shaheen’s omission is notable, both players are also currently featuring in the BBL, and their absence is understood to be part of a broader rotation policy rather than a permanent exclusion. With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup approaching, the selectors appear keen to assess different combinations and expand the pool of players available for the global event.
Another notable inclusion is uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Khawaja Nafay. The 23-year-old, who has been part of the Pakistan Shaheens set-up, has played 32 T20 matches and scored at a strike rate of 132.81, earning his first senior call-up.
Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Sri Lanka in the first week of January, with all three T20Is to be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium in Dambulla on January 7, 9 and 11.
The series forms part of Pakistan’s preparations for the T20 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. Pakistan are set to play all their World Cup fixtures in Colombo.

Tajikistan announced on Thursday that three members of a “terrorist” group had crossed into the Central Asian country “illegally” at Khatlon province, which borders Afghanistan.
Tajik security forces killed the trio, but two border guards also died in the clash, the Tajik national security committee said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said on Saturday that “we have started serious investigations into” the recent “incidents” on Tajik soil.
“I spoke to the foreign minister of Tajikistan and we are working together to prevent such incidents,” he told an event in Kabul.
“We are worried that some malicious circles want to destroy the relations between two neighbouring countries,” the minister added, without elaborating.
Tajikistan shares a mountainous border of about 1,350 kilometres with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities, who returned to power in 2021.
Unlike other Central Asian leaders, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, who has been in power since 1992, has criticised the Taliban and urged them to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan.
At least five Chinese nationals were killed and several wounded in two separate attacks along the border with Afghanistan in late November and early December, according to Tajik authorities.
According to a UN report in December, the jihadist group Jamaat Ansarullah “has fighters spread across different regions of Afghanistan” with a primary goal “to destabilise the situation in Tajikistan”.

The statements came a day after reported Saudi air strikes on separatist positions in Yemen’s Hadramawt province — and after Washington called for restraint in the rapidly escalating conflict.
General Turki al-Malki, the spokesman for the coalition, said they would act “directly and at the appropriate moment… to protect civilian life”, according to the Saudi news agency SPA.
Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman posted on X that troops from the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) should “peacefully hand over” two regional governorates to the government.

Rubio calls for restraint, diplomatic efforts on Yemen

“It’s time,” he posted, “at this sensitive moment, to let reason prevail by withdrawing from the two provinces and doing so peacefully.”







The STC had warned on Friday that they were undeterred after strikes blamed on Saudi Arabia hit their positions, in the latest escalation since they seized large swathes of territory in the Hadramawt and Mahrah provinces.
There were no immediate reports of casualties in the strikes. In recent weeks, separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates and seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen have made territorial gains.
On Saturday, hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen gathered in Aden to ask the STC’s leaders to announce the independence of South Yemen, according to the separatist-affiliated Aden Independent Channel.
The channel aired footage of a large crowd marching and waving the South Yemen independence flag alongside the UAE’s flag.
Experts say their successes have embarrassed regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the main backer of the internationally-recognised Yemeni government.
Farea al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House think tank in London, said that the STC had crossed Riyadh’s “red lines” and that the situation could quickly get worse.
“It is one bad thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia. And it is another much worse thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia publicly. And that’s exactly what they did,” he said.
US urges restraint
In Washington, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “We urge restraint and continued diplomacy, with a view to reaching a lasting solution.”
Following Friday’s raids, Yemen’s government urged the Saudi-led coalition to support its forces in Hadramawt, after separatists seized most of the country’s largest province.
The government asked the coalition to “take all necessary military measures to protect innocent Yemeni civilians in Hadramawt province and support the armed forces”, the official Yemeni news agency said.
A Yemeni military official said that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were amassed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.
The areas where they were deployed are located at the edges of territory seized in recent weeks by the UAE-backed STC.
“We have not received military instructions to move towards the two provinces,” the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Separatist advances have added pressure on ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which support rival groups within Yemen’s government.

In absolute terms, the trade gap with the Middle East widened to $5.948 billion in July-November from $5.514bn in the same period last year, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY25, the deficit with the region increased 7.37pc to $13.974bn from $13.014bn in the preceding year. The swelling trade deficit is a cause for concern among policymakers, primarily due to the rising influx of petroleum products from the region.
The increase was noted in imports from the region, reflecting higher oil imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by Saudi Arabia and other countries.
Exports to the Middle East fell 9.85pc to $1.217bn in 5MFY26 from $1.350bn over the corresponding months of last year. In FY25, exports to the Middle East fell 1.52pc to $3.107bn from $3.155bn over the same period last year.
At the same time, Pakistan’s imports from the Middle East saw an increase of 4.39pc to $7.166bn in 5MFY26 from $6.864bn over the corresponding months of last year. In FY25, imports surged 5.64pc to $17.081bn from $16.169bn over the same period last year.
Pakistan has recently signed a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region. Demand for Pakistani products in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) declined during the period under review.
Exports to Saudi Arabia fell 10.41pc to $272.232m in July-November FY26 from $303.858m over the same months last year. The imports from the kingdom saw an increase of 6.66pc to $1.596bn against $1.496bn in the same period last year.
Exports to the UAE declined 9.99pc to $833.365m in 5MFY26 from $925.940m over the last year. Pakistan’s top export products to the UAE include rice, bovine carcasses, men’s and boys’ cotton ensembles, guavas and mangoes.
The import from the UAE increased by 13.85pc to $3.675bn from $3.228bn over the corresponding months of last year.
Exports to Bahrain stood at $20.243m in 5MFY26, down 10.44pc from $22.603m in the corresponding period last year. Imports from Bahrain reached $91.662m in 5MFY26, up from $75.009m last year, an increase of 22.20pc.
Pakistan’s exports to Qatar stood at $42.337m, down 16.24pc from $50.549m in the corresponding month of last year. The import from Qatar stood at $1.259bn in 5MFY26, down from $1.371bn over the last year, indicating an 8.15pc decline.
The country’s exports to Kuwait stood at $49.308m in 5MFY26, up from $47.651m over the last year, an increase of 3.47pc. However, imports from Kuwait surged to $543.403m from $693.217m over the last year, an increase of 21.61pc.

The unexpected move by the Evacuee Property Trust Board (EPTB) to take over the KCE premises has forced the closure of an institution that had remained operational for 52 years, affecting around 320 registered cotton brokers.
Brokers say they are incurring losses running into billions of rupees due to the complete halt in trading, while the textile industry, particularly spinning mills, is struggling to obtain working capital from banks because cotton rates are unavailable.
No cotton spot rates have been issued since the EPTB took possession of the building on Dec 12. The cotton and cotton-based textile sector contributes about 60 per cent to the country’s export earnings and provides up to 70 per cent of direct and indirect employment nationwide.
“I do not understand why the federal government and the finance minister have not intervened to resolve this issue,” said a senior broker, requesting anonymity.
Brokers warned that if the KCE closure persists, it could trigger a crisis across the textile sector, severely undermining export targets and overall GDP growth.
“It is incomprehensible why policymakers allowed such a drastic action, the confiscation of the building, and have shown no urgency in resolving an issue that is fast turning into a crisis,” the broker said.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Karachi Cotton Association could not be reached for comment. He has neither responded to calls nor publicly spoken against the takeover of the KCE premises.

On Saturday, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates hit a new all time high of Rs407,803 and Rs475,662, up by Rs1,972 and Rs2,300 from Friday, respectively.
As per data rates issued by All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, domestic prices had risen as a result of continuous rally in world gold price which rose by $23 to $4,533 per ounce.
The country’s gold jewellery export had plunged into crisis owing to the abrupt suspension of SRO760 on May 6. After hectic efforts by the stakeholders, the Ministry of Commerce on Nov 21, 2025 had issued an SRO 2198 (I) 2025 by allowing import of gold and jewellery exports after a lapse of over six months.

The SRO said the period of suspension so far under SRO760 was “accordingly condoned”, thereby enabling exporters to avail the mandatory entitlement period of 120 days under the entrustment scheme.
Despite allowing import/export of gold and jewellery, the data of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) pointed out nil import of gold in November while jewellery exports had been struggling to pick up pace. From July to November 2025, jewellery exports during 5MFY26 fell by 97pc to only $113,000 from $8.2m in the same period last fiscal.
Former chairman Pakistan Gems and Jewellery Traders and Exporters Association, Habib ur Rahman told Dawn on Saturday that gold imports have resumed from December with the arrival of 15kg while jewellery exports in December stood at around 50kg. Jewellery exports are being made to the USA, the UK and Dubai.
On January 1, 2025, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates were Rs234,568 and Rs273,600 based on the global gold rate of $2,624 per ounce. Till to date, the price of 10-gram and one-tola have surged by Rs177,235 and Rs202,062, respectively, while international price swelled by $1,909 per ounce.
According to Topline Securities, gold delivered an exceptional higher return of almost 74pc in 2025 as compared to other select asset classes.
The KSE 100 index recorded the second largest increase among various select asset classes, rising by 48pc (Jan 1 to Dec 24) with four trading sessions left in 2025. The gain is inclusive of dividends received during this period.
Historically, real estate has been one of the preferred investment option in Pakistan. Commercial and residential plot prices of DHA Karachi and DHA Lahore on average increased by 18pc and 15pc, respectively, according to Zameen.com, while houses prices in DHA Karachi and DHA Lahore on an average rose by eight per cent.
Topline said Naya Pakistan Pak Rupee Certificates under the Roashan Digital Account generated a return of 22pc in 2025. Rates were revised later in March to 13pc while Naya Pakistan US dollar certificate earned a return of 10pc.
Wthin fixed income market, average bank saving rates remained 9pc while 3-year Special Saving Certificate provided 12pc gain. PIBs delivered a 14pc and T-bill yielded 12pc in 2025.

KARACHI: The first half of the current fiscal year saw the rupee post a net gain against the US dollar of Rs5.066, or 1.8 per cent, although it remains weaker than its level at the beginning of 2025.
The dollar closed at Rs280.13 in the interbank market on Friday compared to Rs285.22 on July 2, 2025. However, the rupee is still below its level on Jan 3, 2025, when the dollar traded at Rs278.56.
Currency market participants said the exchange rate remained “managed” but noted that the recent appreciation had helped stabilise the market and provided greater confidence for exporters and importers.
In a report issued on Saturday, Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa said the rupee’s behaviour often defies traditional valuation models because it moves in “regime shifts”, not smooth cycles.
“This history explains why models such as PPP, BEER or even simplified REER frameworks struggle with PKR. They assume stable policy regimes, political stability and continuous calibration. But PKR operates in regime shifts, not smooth cycles,” he wrote.
PPP refers to Purchasing Power Parity, which compares price levels to estimate a fair exchange rate, while BEER (the Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate) uses economic fundamentals such as productivity and interest-rate differentials to gauge a currency’s value.
“Valuation matters in normal times. But at moments that define PKR’s trajectory, sentiment and policy dominate valuation. That is when these models offer false comfort,” Mr Mamsa said.
Reviewing major episodes in 2008, 2018 and 2022, he said past crises were typically triggered by factors outside the foreign exchange market, including political instability and policy paralysis, oil price spikes and inflation surges, geopolitical shocks and IMF programme disruptions.
“In each case, the initial trigger came from outside the FX (foreign exchange) market. The rupee was not the cause, it became the transmission channel,” he said.
Several currency analysts expect renewed dollar strength in calendar year 2026 despite higher foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan, arguing that reserves alone may not offset widening trade and current account pressures, which have already started showing spikes in FY26.

 

They noted that import compression in November helped deliver a current account surplus but warned that further cuts could weigh on economic growth. Weak GDP growth has become a challenge for a government seeking to attract both foreign and domestic investment, they said.
“Further import cuts could bring another year of poor growth, around 2 per cent, increasing poverty without addressing the serious problem of joblessness,” said Atif Ahmed, a banker and currency expert in the interbank market.
Mr Mamsa said the rupee’s trajectory in 2026 would be driven less by valuation gaps and more by a set of structural forces, including inflation and interest-rate differentials, political continuity and policy credibility, external financing capacity and fiscal discipline, reserve accumulation behaviour, oil prices and export competitiveness, and geopolitical developments and global recession risks.
“These factors do not point to a single number. They determine the path the rupee takes, how volatile it becomes and whether deviations are absorbed or allowed to compound. For Pakistan, crises have never been about the endpoint alone, but more about how the path was managed,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on Saturday went beyond mere condemnation of the recently promulgated Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, cautioning the Punjab government against implementing what it described as the “unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.
Presided over by Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, the outgoing PBC cabinet unanimously demanded that the Punjab government immediately recall the law and tender an apology to the Lahore High Court (LHC) for what it termed “insulting remarks and a rude attitude”.
The PBC — the apex body regulating the legal fraternity — reiterated that lawyers stand firmly with the LHC and will not allow anyone to compromise the integrity of the judiciary.
The council warned that if corrective measures were not taken within a few days, the lawyer’s community would be compelled to launch a movement on the issue.
On December 22, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the law and announced that the matter would be heard and decided by a full bench of the court.
The controversy surrounding the newly enacted law further intensified on Dece­mber 24, when various lawyers’ associations — irrespective of political affiliation — endorsed the Lahore High Court’s intervention to suspend its implementation.
During its 247th meeting, held at the Supreme Court Building in Islamabad on Saturday, the PBC passed a resolution on the issue in addition to conducting other agenda items.
The unanimous resolution rejected and disapproved the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
The resolution also condemned the Punjab government for passing the Act, stating that it was unconstitutional, unlawful, and in conflict with the provisions of the Qanoon-i-Shahadat, Civil Procedure Code (CPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Evidence Act, Illegal Dispossession Act, and other relevant laws, thereby rendering their provisions redundant. The council noted that the matter had been challenged and that the LHC had rightly suspended its implementation.
The council commended and appreciated the LHC chief justice for passing a timely order, observing that the newly enactment compromised established and settled legal principles governing property matters.
The resolution expressed concern that the law had created a parallel system of jurisprudence whereby property disputes would be resolved by deputy commissioners, district police officers, revenue officers, and other government officials instead of courts — a practice it termed wholly unlawful.

 

The PBC further observed that the new law dismantled the civil judicial system, civil rights, and judicial supremacy, as it allowed a revenue officer to hand over possession of property even when the matter was pending before a civil court, suggesting an attempt by certain elements to concentrate all powers, including judicial authority.
The resolution regretted that the Pun­jab government had allegedly resorted to trolling and propaganda against the LHC chief justice and the judiciary. As a result, the council condemned what it described as an onslaught against the LHC following the suspension of the Act.
The council also expressed grave concern over the conduct of the Punjab government, regretting that the province’s chief executive appeared to be surrounded by aides protecting the interests of land mafias and grabbers, alleging that the Act was passed to safeguard those interests.
The resolution emphasised that it was incumbent upon the judiciary to curb and address such unlawful practices in the interest of justice, transparency, and equity, as reflected in the LHC’s order.
It further stated that the judiciary has the constitutional mandate to interpret laws, and that the LHC chief justice had rightly suspended an enactment that undermined judicial authority.

What stands out in this outreach is its diversity: Pakistan is engaging simultaneously with countries experiencing active conflict as well as with relatively stable Gulf monarchies. More importantly, this evolving engagement raises an important question about how these varied relationships are shaping Pakistan’s strategic outlook, policy choices, and approach to statecraft.
Pakistan’s relationship with the Gulf has long rested on deep-rooted economic, political, and security ties shaped by history. However, the recent expansion of engagement reflects a more deliberate and pragmatic approach, suggesting that Islamabad is recalibrating its regional strategy. This recalibration is not only about defence exports or military diplomacy; it also offers Pakistan opportunities to observe and learn from different models of statecraft, both in contexts of stability and in situations marked by political fragmentation and conflict.
In this broader context, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s first official visit to Pakistan on Friday was particularly significant. It came after Pakistan signed a defence cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia in mid-September, an agreement that attracted considerable attention from observers who were closely watching how Pakistan would balance relations with other Gulf states, especially the UAE and Qatar, given their divergent positions on several MENA conflicts.
Sudan provides a clear example of these divergences. The UAE has been widely reported to be supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), while Saudi Arabia has aligned itself with the Sudanese Armed Forces (several reports indicate that Pakistan, through its defence cooperation, has engaged in ways that benefit the SAF, effectively placing Islamabad alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkiye, countries that have leaned towards supporting the Sudanese army against the RSF). This suggests that, despite its careful diplomatic language, Pakistan’s security partnerships are increasingly intersecting with specific regional power alignments.

Pakistan’s role suits the architects of the new Middle East.

Libya presents a different but equally revealing case. Here, Pakistan’s position appears closer to that of the UAE. Islamabad has engaged openly with the eastern Libyan power structure led by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, while Saudi Arabia’s engagement with Haftar remains limited and largely pragmatic. Field Marshal Asim Munir’s visit to eastern Libya, where he met Haftar, the commander-in-chief of the Libyan Arab Armed Forces, was followed by reports that Pakistan had reached a defence deal worth over $4 billion to supply military equipment to the Libyan National Army, despite the existence of a UN arms embargo.
The symbolism of this engagement was not lost on observers: the meeting of two field marshals, an exceptionally rare rank in contemporary global militaries, carried both political and military significance. Apart from Libya, FM Asim Munir visited Cairo, where Pakistan and Egypt reaffirmed their commitment to closer military cooperation, further underscoring Pakistan’s expanding defence diplomacy across North Africa.
Beyond conflict theatres, Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to hold divergent positions on several regional and strategic issues, including the Abraham Accords. Except for a few limited exceptions, Pakistan’s stance has generally aligned more closely with Saudi Arabia, particularly on the Israel-Palestine question. This alignment appears to be translating into more concrete outcomes for Pakistan, especially in defence exports and broader economic cooperation.

 

It is not clear how long this cooperation with the MENA region and other African countries will last, as conflicts in many states are still unfolding, and it is unclear which side will ultimately prevail. Although, as per global diplomatic norms, Pakistan is showing constraint and officially supporting peace initiatives, its tilt and deals will determine its character in the eyes of these nations. It is not certain that the UAE president’s visit is to incentivise Pakistan in the context of the Abraham Accords, or to offer Pakistan some realignment in Islamabad’s strategic priorities in MENA. But it has unfolded that Pakistan’s new approach is cultivating results.
It has to be seen how Pakistan will create balance in its approach and relationship with its key economic and strategic allies in the Gulf, but Pakistan’s realpolitik is in full swing, pragmatically pursuing its policies in the Middle East, as the Gulf states, including the Saudis and the UAE, were doing up till now in the case of India and Pakistan.
Pakistan’s role suits the architects of the new Middle East, whether they are sitting in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Doha, or beyond, not only because of religious brotherhood, but also military power, which is more accommodating towards their strategic and political interests. Pakistan has gained geopolitical and geoeconomic strength through its accommodative approach, but consolidating these gains has remained a challenge. Perhaps the answer lies in the country’s state structure, which has similarities with many states in the MENA region that are facing chronic political disorder. A Middle Eastern scholar, Fawaz Gerges, in his book The Great Betrayal, sought to find the roots of this political disorder. What he found was that an overemphasis on strengthening security institutions creates two major problems.
First, it allows external actors to intervene in domestic affairs and shape policies. Second, and more crucially, doctrinal authoritarian regimes suppress natural ethnic, cultural, social, and religious divisions, which democracy allows societies to address through continuous dialogue. These divisions and divergences continue to thrive beneath the weight of suppression and eventually surface in the form of fractured ideologies, toxic narratives, and violent tendencies.
Gerges notes that the struggle in the Middle East is multifaceted, extending far beyond territorial disputes. It is ideological, cultural, and institutional, unfolding among a wide range of actors, including conservatives, Islamists, nationalists, and ordinary citizens.
Perhaps there are lessons to be drawn from the region, but this depends on political priorities. When certain policies appear to yield economic and political gains, states often ignore deeper structural similarities and the long-term risks they entail.

• Pact halts troop movement, promises return of captured soldiers• UN, China welcome step following breakdown of October ceasefire
BANGKOK: Thailand and Cambodia agreed to an “immediate” ceasefire on Saturday, pledging in a joint statement to end heavy border clashes that have killed at least 47 people and displaced more than a million.
The truce took effect after a declaration signed by the neighbours’ defense ministers at a border checkpoint on the Thai side. The agreement applies to “all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas”.
The three weeks of fighting, which utilised artillery, tanks, drones and jets, had spread to nearly every border province. The violence shattered a previous truce brokered in October, for which US President Donald Trump had taken credit.
Thai Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit described the initial three-day window as an “observation period to confirm that the ceasefire is real”.
“A door to a peaceful resolution,” Nattaphon called the agreement in a speech on Saturday.
Under the terms of the deal, both sides agreed to freeze troop movements and allow civilians in border areas to return home. The nations also pledged to cooperate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime. Additionally, Thailand agreed to return 18 captured Cambodian soldiers within 72 hours.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the announcement “as a positive step towards alleviating the suffering of civilians … and creating an environment conducive to achieving lasting peace,” according to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
The conflict is rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of the 800-kilometre border, where both nations claim ancient temples based on a vague 1907 French map.
Official tallies indicate at least 25 Thai soldiers and one Thai civilian were killed in the recent hostilities.
Cambodia, facing a military with superior firepower, reported 21 civilian deaths. Phnom Penh has reported no military deaths, though an official Facebook post showed first lady Pich Chanmony atte­nding a funeral for troops.

 

This ceasefire follows three days of talks convened after a crisis meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
International powers also pressed for a resolution. In Beijing, the foreign ministry stated that the ceasefire “demonstrates that dialogue and consultations are a realistic and effective way of resolving complex disputes”.
China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is scheduled to host the Cambodian and Thai foreign ministers for talks in Yunnan province on Jan 28-29.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk said he hoped the ceasefire “will pave the way for confidence building and peace”.
Despite the halt in combat, the countries still must resolve the border demarcation. An earlier agreement in October, witnessed by Trump, broke down within months as each side accused the other of instigating fresh violence.

THE year 2025 will be remembered in Islamabad and Was­hington as a period of surprising warmth in bilateral ties, marked by high-level engagement, strategic recalibrations, and complex regional developments.
After years of drift, Pakistan-US relations saw a notable thaw, but beneath the optimism lies a layered and complex reality shaped by history, personalities, and shifting global alignments — prompting analysts to urge restraint in reading the moment as a lasting reset.
The year’s diplomacy pivoted with an unprecedented White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, widely viewed as a game-changer. The meeting set the tone for renewed engagement and discussions on trade, security, and regional diplomacy.
Sherry Rehman, federal minister and former ambassador to Washington, described the shift as personality-driven but consequential.
“In both countries, particularly in Washington, leading personalities have swung the pendulum back toward a warming of ties,” she said.
She noted that the “Trump-Munir bromance” was a key ingredient in reshaping the dynamic, while other strategic plays had also tilted the graph to an upward trend.

 

Ms Rehman noted that the relationship would be best served by embedding it in the firm ground of strong commercial and economic ties.
She highlighted the US investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector as a potential anchor for long-term engagement.
“The scale of investments, their contractual longevity, and capacity to generate local jobs will be critical in determining the trajectory of ties.”
On broader foreign policy, she noted: “Pakistan’s interests will be best realised by maintaining a classic policy balance amid growing multipolarity and conflict in global affairs.”
She added that Islamabad should continue retaining its “bedrock friendship” with Beijing while avoiding being caught in any zero-sum competition arising between two leading global powers.
War and US’s statements
The May 2025 India-Pakistan air war injected urgency to US’s engagement with Islamabad.
In the aftermath of the ceasefire, President Trump publicly highlighted Islamabad’s role in preventing the escalation to a wider conflict.
Pakistan also recognised President Trump’s role in averting a nuclear crisis in South Asia and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Analysts noted that President Trump’s repeated public commendations — reportedly over 30 mentions of Pakistan’s performance — strengthened Islamabad’s diplomatic standing.
“A new president was more open and realised that Pakistan could play a role in furthering American strategic interests in both the economic and security domains,” said Uzair Yunus, a Washington-based South Asia analyst.
The broader context included US-India tensions over trade, tariffs, and New Delhi’s growing ties with Russia. These frictions, combined with the US’s focus on Pakistan’s stabilising role in South Asia, increased Islamabad’s leverage in Washington’s strategic calculus.
Regional diplomacy
The Trump administration also highlighted Pakistan’s potential role in the Middle East, including possible participation in a Gaza peace force and mediation in Iran-related initiatives. While the force is still being finalised, discussions underscore its emerging relevance.
Ms Rehman warned that regional volatility would test Islamabad’s diplomacy. While Pakistan’s hard power, demonstrated in the May conflict, had altered perceptions of it as a middle power, she said the real challenge lay in navigating partnerships without comp­­­romising core foreign policy values or domestic priorities.
Caution urged
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Washington, London, and the UN, urged caution against overreading recent developments.
“The recent warmth shows that a hopeful beginning has been made for a reset in Pak-US ties,” she said, “but one should avoid hastily concluding ties are on a sustainable upswing.”
She noted that the current turnaround rested heavily on a personalised relationship between Trump and Pakistan’s army chief, making it short-term.
“Durable relations are built on shared interests and convergences bet­ween countries,” she added.
“I see the hybrid government’s US policy predicated on sycophancy, sweetheart business deals, and willingness to fall in line with Trump’s Middle East agenda.”
Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, echoed the need for realism.
He noted that while the resurgence in bilateral ties was certainly one of Islamabad’s biggest surprises this year, it was important not to overstate the resurgence.
He noted that beyond a few memorandums on critical minerals and limited counterterrorism cooperation, substantive collaboration remained modest.
Looking ahead
Ms Rehman emphasised the domestic angle, stressing the importance of transparency, skills development, and social inclusion in managing international investment.
She also highlighted people-to-people ties, noting that even during downturns, travel, cultural exchanges, and diaspora links had sustained the relationship.
In the end, 2025 might not mark a full revamp of ties between the two countries, but it stands out as the year both sides found enough common ground to try again — a meaningful step for a relationship long defined by cycles of tension and rapprochement.

Zelenskiy cast the vast overnight attack, which he said involved about 500 drones and 40 missiles and which knocked out power and heat in parts of the capital, as Russia’s response to the ongoing peace efforts brokered by Washington.
The Ukrainian leader has said Sunday’s talks in Florida would focus on security guarantees and territorial control once fighting ends in Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two, started by Russia’s 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour.
The attack continued throughout the morning, with a nearly 10-hour air raid alert for the capital. Authorities said two people were killed in Kyiv and the surrounding region, while at least 46 people were wounded, including two children.
“Today, Russia demonstrated how it responds to peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Zelenskiy told reporters.
In Russia, air defence forces shot down eight drones headed for Moscow, the city’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Saturday.
Explosions echoed across Kyiv from the early hours on Saturday as Ukraine’s air defence units went into action. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south.State grid operator Ukrenergo said energy facilities across Ukraine were struck, and emergency power cuts had been implemented across the capital.
DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said the attack had left more than a million households in and around Kyiv without power, 750,000 of which remained disconnected by the afternoon.
Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said over 40% of residential buildings in Kyiv were left without heat as temperatures hovered around 0 degrees Celsius on Saturday.
Territorial control: A diplomatic stumbling block
On the way to meeting Trump in Florida, Zelenskiy stopped in Canada’s Halifax to meet Prime Minister Mark Carney, after which they planned to hold a call with European leaders.
In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney noted that peace “requires a willing Russia.”
“The barbarism that we saw overnight the attack on Kyiv shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” he said, announcing 2.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.
Territory and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remain the main diplomatic stumbling blocks, though Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv on Friday that a 20-point draft document - the cornerstone of a US push to clinch a peace deal - is 90% complete.
He said the shape of US security guarantees was crucial, and these would depend on Trump, and “what he is ready to give, when he is ready to give it, and for how long.”
Zelenskiy told Axios earlier this week that the US had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression.
Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process.“He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told Politico. “So we’ll see what he’s got.” Trump said he believed Sunday’s meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin “soon, as much as I want.”
Fate of Donetsk is key
Moscow is demanding that Ukraine withdraw from a large, densely-urbanised chunk of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in nearly four years of war. Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines.
Russia has been grinding slowly forwards throughout 2025 at the cost of significant casualties on the drone-infested battlefield.
On Saturday, both sides issued conflicting claims about two frontline towns: Myrnohrad in the east and Huliaipole in the south. Moscow claimed to have captured both, while Kyiv said it had beaten back Russian assaults there.
Under a US compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukrainian troops pull back from parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out.
Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the US to back Ukraine’s position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire allowing Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote.
On Saturday, Zelenskiy said it was not possible to have such a referendum while Russia was bombarding Ukrainian cities.
He also suggested that he would be ready for “dialogue” with the people of Ukraine if they disagreed with points of the plan.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv’s version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the US, according to the Interfax-Russia news agency.
But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a “turning point” in the search for a settlement.</p><small>2025-12-27 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27193232dd24168.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963556/kp-cm-afridi-doubts-governments-talks-offer-says-efforts-underway-to-start-pti-street-movement' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi doubts government’s talks offer, says efforts underway to start PTI street movement</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi cast doubt on the government’s sincerity in holding talks with the PTI and said he was actively making efforts to initiate the party’s street movement by reaching out to multiple stakeholders.
Accompanied by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and other leaders on the second day of his three-day visit to Lahore, the KP chief minister spoke to the media on two occasions while visiting the residences of incarcerated party leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed.
Answering a question about the prospects of dialogue with the government in the wake of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer, the KP chief minister said: “Incumbent rulers are showing no sign of dialogue and instead are displaying their dictatorship mindset, which was inculcated in their minds since they began politics.”
Asked whether he believed issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, CM Afridi said Imran Khan had assigned the responsibility for “dialogue or protest” to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
The KP chief minister said that while the TTAP was “making efforts on its end,” which he supported, he had been directed to prepare for a street movement and would take “those preparations to their peak”.
“Imran Khan is a symbol of national solidarity and stresses that everyone needs to respect others,” the chief minister added.
For the street movement, he said he was in contact with all party leaders and organisations, as well as wings within the party to run the movement.
The TTAP on Thursday welcomed PM Shehbaz’s recent invitation for talks. However, no concrete steps have so far been taken by the government to initiate a formal talks process, and PTI leaders say they are waiting for the government to make the first move.
PM’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has stressed that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations.
Referring to the Punjab government’s claim that the PTI had been eliminated from Punjab, he challenged the authorities by saying he could hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on 24 hours’ notice, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would take a week to stage one, allowing a comparison of the PTI’s and PML-N’s popularity.
CM Afridi quipped that he would even support her by setting up a stage and providing vehicles to transport supporters.







He also criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him, as well as party leaders and workers, during his arrival at the Chakri interchange to reach the Punjab Assembly a day ago.
“This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“
Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive.
He said the Punjab government had not responded to the KP government’s request regarding his desire to meet incarcerated PTI leaders at Kot Lakhpat jail. “The incumbent rulers have neither allowed me to meet my leader Imran Khan nor the leaders who are incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail,” CM Afridi added.
The KP chief minister said that he was impressed with the courage that the incarcerated leaders and their family members had shown in the face of the “fascism” unleashed against them.
As planned, CM Afridi’s entourage reached Food Street for dinner but was surprised to find that all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off and even the general public evicted.
The chief minister came out of his vehicle from the sunroof and chanted slogans with the public in Imran’s favour.
As the entourage returned without having dinner, CM Afridi said the KP government had formally conveyed beforehand that it would go to the Food Street for dinner.
“This is how the Punjab government is treating us. The whole Food Street has been shut down,” he regretted.







He later visited the residence of PTI member Sanam Javed’s in-laws and lauded her efforts for the party.
Bemoans treatment of courts in address to LHCBA
Speaking to the legal community at the Lahore High Court Bar Association, CM Afridi lamented that the courts in the country had been rendered useless after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
He said three judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had allowed him to meet Imran, but “a mere jail superintendent threw the orders in the dustbin”.
The chief minister urged the lawyers’ fraternity to “stand for an independent judiciary” in the party’s struggle for real independence. He complained that PTI workers were not even allowed to hold party flags in the open.
Referring to his responsibility to run the PTI’s street movement, he said Imran wanted the Constitution and the judiciary to be restored in their original shape. “The PTI is standing with the independence of the judiciary,” he added.
Visit to Imran’s Zaman Park residence
The KP chief minister also visited Imran’s residence at Zaman Park with Aleema Khanum, amid a massive police deployment around the house.
The two spoke at a joint media talk, while party workers engaged in loud sloganeering.



Aleema alleged the Punjab government was “terrified to the point that it had closed all roads leading to Zaman Park and stopped even women and children from reaching there. They have converted Zaman Park into a jail, where even residents cannot go in or out,” she added.
Referring to the massive police deployment outside her residence, she said she was not afraid and continued rebuffing any “cheap tactics.”
She said CM Afridi and others would come and sit at the spot too, and people would see how long the administration would be able to hold them away.
“Today is the beginning of the movement; the Punjab government will not be able to stop people on Lahore roads soon,” she asserted, and asked, “Will they shut down all of Lahore?”
Answering a question, she said, Imran had given his clear-cut message through Noreen Niazi that people should come out on the roads because the “incumbent rulers want to prolong their rule and loot in the country”.
CM Afridi said that he was half-happy that he had arrived at his leader’s home alone and wished he had been accompanied by Imran. “My leader will soon be with me here,” he said.
He said those in the government never wanted talks; instead, they wanted the confrontation between the political parties to continue.
Later, he paid a brief visit to the residences of Hammad Azhar, where he offered prayers for the recently deceased Mian Azhar, and party worker Zill-e-Shah, who died during a party protest in 2023.
Meetings with families of jailed leaders
CM Afridi first visited Qureshi‘s home, with visuals released by the PTI on X showing the former foreign minister’s son Zain Qureshi and daughter Meher Bano present during the meeting. Addressing the media alongside them, Afridi said, “This is my Pakistan, and wherever I go, I do not need a reason for it.”
The chief minister said the aim of his Lahore trip was to meet party leaders.
Afridi mentioned the names of multiple incarcerated leaders he wanted to meet and added, “I also wanted to meet the rest of the leadership and workers, but unfortunately, they did not let me meet them.”







Following Afridi’s visit, Zain expressed his heartfelt gratitude to him and other PTI leaders in a post on X.
He said the KP CM enquired about Qureshi’s health, “hailed his sacrifices and also visited my mother”. “His visit is a source of encouragement and strength for us.”
According to statements by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, CM Afridi also met Yasmin’s husband, Rashid Nabi Malik, and Chaudhry’s wife and children.

 

According to PTI lawyer Naeem Panjutha, the KP CM was not able to visit former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema’s house as it was located in a cantonment and “permission was not being given to enter”.







At Rasheed’s residence, KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi asserted that Punjab stood with Imran and “had always given us affection”.
While on his way to Rasheed’s house, Panjutha said there will be lots of people on the streets of Lahore in the evening, and called on the public to take part in the PTI’s movement till Imran’s release.







First day in Lahore
Afridi had arrived in Lahore on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Although the KP CM managed to reach Liberty Roundabout last night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets.
Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he had thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of the police during the journey to Lahore.
“Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.”
In separate remarks to the media, Afridi had said he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes.
“We will take Imran Khan’s ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he had asserted.</p><small>2025-12-27 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/272142208fe7114.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963580/no-connection-with-party-pti-distances-itself-from-uk-protester-as-party-faces-backlash' target='_blank'><strong>‘No connection with party’: PTI distances itself from UK protester as party faces backlash</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday distanced itself from “provocative” remarks by a protester during a demonstration in the British city of Bradford, as the party continues to face backlash from the government and other quarters.
In the video posted on PTI’s UK page and since deleted, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags.
Pakistan also issued a demarche to the acting British high commissioner, demanding action against all those involved. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. He urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”.
In a strongly-worded statement on Saturday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that the speech delivered by the demonstrator in the UK has “no connection” whatsoever with the party.







Furthermore, he stated that the woman held no position within PTI and has no affiliation with the party. Therefore, PTI completely disowned her rhetoric and emphasised that it has never endorsed such irresponsible and inflammatory statements from any party office-bearer.
Akram stated that the views expressed, the language used, and the tone adopted in the speech do not reflect PTI’s official stance, political ideology, or vision.
“PTI, as a matter of principle, strongly opposes violence, hate speech, incitement, inflammatory rhetoric, and the use of unethical or indecent language in political discourse. PTI firmly believes in democratic, constitutional, and peaceful political struggle, and does not endorse or support any individual or group engaging in conduct contrary to these values,” he said.
The PTI also strongly condemned the Punjab government for the treatment of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, his cabinet, parliamentarians, and the accompanying delegation during their visit to Punjab.
Afridi arrived in Lahore on Friday to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of party founder Imran Khan, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism.
The party’s information secretary said the visit, which began on December 26 in Lahore and various districts of Punjab as a peaceful, democratic, and political engagement aimed at meeting party workers and discussing public issues, was deliberately turned by the Punjab government into an exercise in political vendetta and hate-driven politics.
Akram pointed out that CM KP and his delegation were stopped at multiple locations, their routes blocked, and they faced physical pushback and humiliating treatment inside the Punjab Assembly.
“The forcible ejection of our elected representatives from the assembly constitutes a flagrant breach of federal respect and democratic norms,” he added.
The party’s information secretary said that the deployment of heavy police forces to stop a peaceful rally at Liberty Chowk reflected the rising fear of public power among the current rulers.
Waqas said he was astonished that, to further aggravate the situation, certain planted elements posing as journalists were brought forward, whose objective was neither reporting nor questioning, but a deliberate and well-planned attempt to provoke, ridicule, and fuel provincial hatred.
He asserted that questioning a constitutional office-holder like the provincial chief executive with allegations such as whether he had “brought narcotics” was not only extremely despicable and shameful, reflecting a base mindset, but also a direct insult to the people of KP and the elected chief minister of a province.
Waqas emphasised that such questions were not journalism, but rather a well-calculated attempt to sow provincial distrust and hatred, which PTI condemned in the strongest possible terms.
He added that rogue elements undoubtedly existed in every field, but degrading a respected profession like journalism to such an extent was both regrettable and condemnable.
“We call upon responsible media organisations and esteemed journalists to hold accountable those within their ranks who, under any specific agenda, pressure, or personal gain, use such hateful and unethical language,” he demanded.
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) spokesperson, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousufzai, said in a statement that the Punjab Police behaved rudely and inhumanely with the province’s chief executive, as well as the accompanying ministers and members, from Chakri all the way to the Punjab Assembly.
“So-called tout journalists asked them extremely petty and degrading questions with the sole purpose of humiliating them. When this still did not satisfy them, police goons were sent to launch an attack on Liberty Chowk,” he claimed.
He said that such tactics could not harm the opposition in any way; rather, they clearly exposed fear and panic.
“We categorically do not believe that such conduct has any connection with the poor, hardworking people of Punjab. Instead, it reflects a defeated and depraved mindset that was thrown into the dustbin of history by the people’s silent revolution on February 8, 2024,” Akhunzada said.</p><small>2025-12-27 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/272244268cb1c5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963550/bilawal-urges-greater-role-for-provinces-as-solution-to-centres-financial-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal urges greater role for provinces as solution to Centre’s financial woes</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government’s financial issues.
The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir was assassinated in a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering.
The Sindh government announced a public holiday today to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary. Foolproof security for the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.

 

Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own.
“If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.”







“We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.”
Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.
“We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.”
Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.
“We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.”



On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis.
The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward.







He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters.
“Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.”
President Zardari says PPP always ready to defend Pakistan
In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination.
He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious.







“Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.”
He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”.
‘Unity over division’
In an earlier message on his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.”
He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”.
“She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said.
“On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added.







Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives.
“Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted.
“She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife.
“Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”.

 

“For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare.







Bilawal, in a message released by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying.
Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities.
“We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said.







Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”.
He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”.
Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who paid a visit to her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.
“She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.”
Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.”







Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”.
“Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari.







Govt delegation to attend gathering at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh
Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary.
The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership.







In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.”
He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state.
“Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27193931468cd3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963578/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-in-us-monday-israeli-official' target='_blank'><strong>Netanyahu to meet Trump in US Monday: Israeli official</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will depart for the United States on Sunday and meet with President Donald Trump in Florida a day later, an Israeli official told AFP.
It will be Netanyahu’s fifth visit to see Trump in the United States this year.
His trip comes as the Trump administration and regional mediators push to proceed to the second stage of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Trump told reporters in mid-December that Netanyahu would probably visit him in Florida during the Christmas holidays.
“He would like to see me. We haven’t set it up formally, but he’d like to see me,” Trump said before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort.
Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported on Wednesday that a wide range of regional issues was expected to be discussed, including Iran, talks on an Israel-Syria security agreement, the ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the next stages of the Gaza deal.
Progress in moving to the second phase of October’s Gaza ceasefire agreement, which was brokered by Washington and its regional allies, has so far been slow.
The ceasefire also remains fragile, with both sides alleging violations and mediators fearing that Israel and Hamas alike are stalling.
Under the second stage, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, an interim authority is to govern the Palestinian territory instead of Hamas, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.
It also includes a provision for the Palestinian movement Hamas to lay down its weapons — a major sticking point.
On Friday, US news outlet Axios reported that the meeting between Trump and Netanyahu was key to advancing to the next steps of the deal.
Citing White House officials, Axios said that the Trump administration wanted to announce the Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza and the ISF as soon as possible.
It reported that senior Trump officials have grown “increasingly frustrated as Netanyahu has taken steps to undermine the fragile ceasefire and stall the peace process”.
Yedioth Ahronoth said the prospect of Iran rebuilding its nuclear programme and ballistic missile capabilities was likely to top the agenda for Netanyahu.</p><small>2025-12-27 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27160819f582a60.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963564/former-sbp-governor-dr-shamshad-akhtar-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Former SBP governor Dr Shamshad Akhtar passes away</strong></a><br><p>Renowned economist and former State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Dr Shamshad Akhtar, 71, passed away due to cardiac arrest on Saturday.
She was serving as chairperson of the Pakistan Stock Exchange at the time of her death, giving her a rare role spanning Pakistan’s monetary policy, fiscal management and capital markets.
Akhtar, known for her leadership roles in both national and international financial institutions, took over as the 14th governor of the SBP on January 2, 2006, becoming the first woman to hold the position.
She had also been the finance minister in the caretaker setups before the 2018 and 2024 general elections.
Akhtar also served as the vice president of the World Bank for the Middle East and North Africa and the executive secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
Prior to her appointment as SBP governor, Akhtar served as the director general of the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Southeast Asia Department since January 2004. She also held the position of the Governance, Finance and Trade Division director for ADB’s East and Central Asia Department.
Born in Hyderabad, Akhtar received her early education in Karachi and Islamabad. She graduated from the University of Punjab with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 1974.
She then acquired a Master‘s degree in Economics from the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, an M.A. in Development Economics from the University of Sussex in 1977 and a PhD in Economics from the United Kingdom’s Paisley College of Technology in 1980. She was also a post-doctoral fellowship Fulbright Scholar and was a visiting fellow at the Department of Economics, Harvard University in 1987.
‘Served the country with honesty and dedication’
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over her passing and paid tribute to her services in the field of economics and financial management, noting her contributions to strengthening economic governance in the country.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the late former central bank governor and said she was a “devoted public servant” and served the nation with distinction.
“She made outstanding contributions to strengthening Pakistan’s financial architecture,” said the premier and offered his “heartfelt condolences and prayers” to the family.







Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb described Akhtar as a principled and dignified voice in Pakistan’s economic history, praising her integrity, professionalism and long public service.
“She served the country with honesty and dedication in some of the most senior economic roles,” Aurangzeb said in a statement, offering condolences to her family, friends and colleagues.







Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal also paid tributes to the former SBP governor. He said he was “deeply saddened” by her passing and offered his prayers and deepest condolences to her family.







The United Nations ESCAP, of which Akhtar was the former executive secretary, said the economist “steadfastly worked to strengthen regional economic cooperation and integration, supporting inclusive and sustainable development across Asia and the Pacific”.







Pakistan‘s former ambassador to the UN, Maleeha Lodhi, said she was “devastated” by the former SBP governor’s passing. She said Akhtar’s services to the country would always be remembered and she was an “outstanding professional and a wonderful, caring human being”.







Journalists Khurram Husain and Ali Khizar also offered prayers and condolences on Dr Akhtar’s passing.

The auction for the two teams is slated for Jan 8 in Islamabad and comes after the PCB, which had received 12 proposals, had earlier said that investors from the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan expressed their interest in acquiring the franchises up for sale.
“A total of 12 proposals were received from interested parties within the stipulated deadline from across the globe and were scrutinised by the PCB Bid Committee over the last three days,” PCB said in a statement.
“Following a thorough and transparent evaluation process, the PCB Bid Committee has qualified 10 bidders who have successfully met the technical criteria and now enter the second stage.
“These 10 technically qualified bidders will now proceed to participate in the auction scheduled on Thursday, 8 January, 2026 at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad, where the franchise rights for the two new HBL PSL teams will be up for grabs.
“At the auction, the successful bidders will have the right to choose their franchise team names from amongst the following: Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Faisalabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Sialkot.”
PSL chief executive officer Salman Naseer said that the league, which will expand to eight teams by the coming edition, “appreciates the strong interest shown by both local and international investors”.
“The league looks forward to achieving another significant milestone in the expansion and evolution of the PSL as we now prepare for the eagerly awaited auction,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.</p><small>2025-12-27 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715373259eea97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963562/dar-hails-pakistans-success-in-may-conflict-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Dar hails Pakistan’s success in May conflict with India</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year.
“A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025.
“Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year.



Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation.
“We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted.
He recalled that Pakistan shot down seven jets of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for intercepting 79 out of 80 drones sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours.
The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the Pulwama and the Pahalgam incidents.
“This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said.
Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10.
“The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s retaliatory operation.
“After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that.
Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.”
Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’.
“Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled.
He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire.
“It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said.
“Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons.
“Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.”

 

The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”.
Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.
On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others.
Ice breaks with Bangladesh
The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived.
Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had visited Bangladesh in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there.
“My 36-hour visit to Bangladesh was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed.
“During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls.
“Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said.
Positive ties with US
Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire.
“That is why on June 11, we nominated [President Donald] Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said.

 

“President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped.
“Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 12:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715375165bc0f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963563/dialogue-not-deadlock-pml-n-leaders-assail-pti-for-mixed-signals-over-talks-with-govt' target='_blank'><strong>‘Dialogue not deadlock’: PML-N leaders assail PTI for mixed signals over talks with govt</strong></a><br><p>PML-N leaders on Saturday said PTI had been sending mixed signals regarding talks with the government, stressing that democracy could only be advanced through “dialogue and not deadlock”.
On Friday, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations. PM Shehbaz on Tuesday extended an offer for talks with the opposition.
The PTI outright rejected talks with the government on the directions of party founder Imran Khan, but Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), of which the PTI is a part, stated its openness to negotiate with the government.
PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, made the remarks while speaking to the media in Sukkur. The delegation is headed to Garhi Khuda Bakhsh for the 18th death anniversary of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
“On one hand, they (PTI) say we should hold dialogue and then on the other hand, Aleema Khan says anyone in favour of dialogue can not be a part of the party,“ Chaudhry said.
While Sanaullah — in response to a question about the talks and speculation surrounding the PTI founder being moved to Balochistan — maintained: “As a political party, we believe that democracy is advanced through dialogue, not deadlock, which is why both PML-N and PPP have always tried to ensure that all political parties sit down and resolve their political issues through dialogue.”
However, he continued, “the PTI founder has had this attitude since 2011 and then from 2018-2022 and now in 2025 […] he does not believe in political dialogue”.
Addressing the issue of restrictions on visitation, Sanaullah said, “No one can be allowed to plan chaos and anarchy in the country,” alleging that the PTI founder had been doing so through his “meetings, messaging and tweets”.
He said the party founder was “badmouthing the political leadership,” adding that the ban on meetings was “in accordance with the law”.
“As for dialogue, we have always remained ready; we still are. If they want to talk, that’s fine; if they don’t, it’s their decision,” he said.
He further added that during court proceedings on the visitation issue, PTI’s Salman Akram Raja had assured the court that after every meeting, the party would not hold any press conference or engage in any “political messaging”.
“But now they are going against their own statement,” he said.
He also said that the PTI founder’s trials were being held in jail rather than in court, as his “protection remained a top priority for the government”.
On the matter of talks, Sadiq recalled that the PM has “repeatedly said that we are ready for dialogue“.
“In my capacity as the NA speaker, I have also said that the office of speaker is available whenever you want to come and talk, but it seems they will have to make a decision”.
He hoped that “once the PTI agrees […] some way forward can be found”.
“They tell the media that they want to talk; there is an office available, they should come, and we will welcome them,“ he added.
The speaker also stated that the ruling coalition (PPP and PML-N) “intended to play a long innings” in their partnership and aimed to “work towards the betterment of Pakistan.”
The NA speaker, in response to a question regarding the speculation surrounding a 28th Constitutional Amendment, said that he had “no knowledge of such a plan”.
“There is no discussion or debate in the house about it,” he said.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance TTAP, the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.</p><small>2025-12-27 12:23</small></div><hr>
