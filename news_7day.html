In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.
“Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij, including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement further said that the militant leader was the deputy of TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and the head of Rehbari Shura of Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”.
“It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij, while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said.
“It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
“It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said.
18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan
Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists.
 






“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement posted on the social media platform X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.</p><small>2025-10-30 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30125954f85fbb5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952145/3-candidates-contesting-todays-polls-for-senate-seat-vacated-after-shibli-farazs-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>3 candidates contesting today’s polls for Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification</strong></a><br><p>Three candidates are vying for the Senate’s vacant general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in today’s by-elections being held at the KP Assembly.
The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Though three candidates are in the run for the polls, the contest is expected to be between PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan and opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi.
Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, is the covering candidate for Zeeshan.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan.
 






The polling, which began at 9:30am, will continue till 4pm. Provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul is the returning officer for the polls.
A total of 145 KP lawmakers are eligible to cast their ballots for the Senate seat, with a minimum of 75 votes needed to win.

Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year.
Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion.
 
 

Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature.
Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls.
Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court.
CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today
Meanwhile, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections have concluded today.
This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier.
 
 

Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”.
Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today.
He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”.
 
 

The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors.
CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.”
“This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations.
The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.

The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
 
 

Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the case, in which Mazari and Chattha both denied guilt.
The court summoned all prosecution witnesses for the next hearing and ordered Chattha to once again submit bail bonds, to which Mazari responded, “If you want to arrest us, reject my bail as well.”
The judge replied, “My principle is that if I respect you, I will get respect.”
Mazari’s advocate, Qaiser Imam, pointed out that the accused also had to appear in other cases, “sometimes at the Islamabad High Court (IHC), sometimes in Rawalpindi”.
However, in response, Judge Majoka said that he had “adjourned the hearing three times on their request for that reason”.
The court then adjourned the hearing till November 5.
Yesterday, Chattha had been arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom” on social media platform X.
 






Speaking to reporters outside the court today, Chattha claimed that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”, saying, “This was not according to any law.”
He added that Majoka had recalled his “illegal order” even before they could argue against it today, but had insisted that they submit another Rs10,000 bail bond as the previous one had been forfeited. He also recalled this order after Chattha refused to comply with it, the advocate said.
“The principle is this … you are running a court, you are a judge; how are you so far removed from the four corners of law?” he said while speaking to the media. “Why do you feel that doing this (specifically targeting the two accused) will get you praise?”
Chattha also said that the era of the courts intimidating people with the threat of jail time or punishments was over, saying, “Nowadays, word spreads very quickly. People are present — witnesses are present and they see this.”
 






Asked what proceedings had been delayed yesterday and whether they had taken place today, the advocate said that only four days after the supply of copy, the court wanted to frame the charge. According to him, the judge had told the accused beforehand that if there were cases against them, they could come in at the end of the day as he was there until 3:30pm.
“Imaan went first in the morning, then at 11am, then sat there waiting for him from 2-2:30pm,” he said. “He did not leave his chamber.”
Chattha added, “The moment I got back from cases in Pindi, I was present in court before 2:35pm. And he got angry that I had appeared at the end of the day, so he couldn’t indict me … So he forfeited the bail bonds and issued the warrant to my face and had me arrested from the courtroom.”</p><small>2025-10-30 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012271710cb9ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952151/sc-constitutional-bench-refers-plea-against-mahrangs-detention-to-practice-and-procedure-committee' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench refers plea against Mahrang’s detention to Practice and Procedure Committee</strong></a><br><p>A five-member Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Thursday referred a plea against the detention of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Mahrang Baloch to the Practice and Procedure Committee, which forms benches and fixes cases under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
The plea, filed by Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi in June, urges the SC to set aside an April 15 order of the Balo­ch­istan High Court (BHC) that rej­ected a petition against Mahrang’s detention under the Main­tenance of Public Order— a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order initially for a period of 30 days. Mahrang is currently detained at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta on charges of attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting people to violence.
The plea filed by her sister was taken up by the CB today. The CB was headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprised Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi Shakeel Ahmad.
During the hearing, Nadia’s counsel Siddiqui argued that “this case should be fixed before a regular bench and not a constitutional bench”.
At this, Justice Mazhar said, “Since you have challenged the MPO, that makes this a case for the CB.”
Siddiqi responded by saying that he did not ask for “an interpretation of the law” and had only challenged the MPO order.
Subsequently, the court referred the case to the Practice and Procedure Committee.
Appeal
Mahrang, whose advocacy group has been working against enforced disappearances since 2018, has been in detention since March 22.
Nadia had initially filed a petition in the BHC against her sister’s detention. However, in its April 15 order, the BHC disposed of the application and directed the petitioner to approach the Balochistan Home Department.
Subsequently, Nadia had approached the apex court. The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state were named as res­pon­dents in her petition filed in the SC.
The plea contended that the April 15 BHC order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The petition alleged that Mahrang’s repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
 
 

It stated that Mahrang’s father and brother, too, were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
The appeal further said that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detainee and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It recalled that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The petition further contended that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner, by issuing the MPO order, acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.
BYC leaders’ detention
Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the MPO in March and have remained in custody since, having been remanded multiple times.
They were initially taken into custody for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, their detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order for their detention.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-10-30 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301247574742954.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952155/indian-state-backed-refinery-halts-russian-oil' target='_blank'><strong>Indian state-backed refinery halts Russian oil</strong></a><br><p>Indian state-backed refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy has halted purchases of Russian crude after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two largest oil companies, the firm said.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
Trump has claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to cut his Russian oil imports as part of a prospective US trade deal — something New Delhi has not confirmed.
HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL), a joint venture between steel tycoon Lakshmi Niwas Mittal and state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), said it had “taken the decision to suspend further purchases of Russian crude”.
The statement, issued on Wednesday, said last week the decision came after “recent announcements of new restrictions on imports of crude oil from Russia” by the United States, European Union (EU) and United Kingdom.
“HMEL’s business activity is in-line with [the] Indian government and energy security policy”, the statement added.
Reliance Industries, the privately-owned main Indian buyer of Russian crude, said last week it was assessing the implications of Washington’s restrictions, as well as those imposed this week by the EU.
“We will comply with the EU’s guidelines on the import of refined products into Europe,” a spokesperson for the company said, and with any guidelines from the Indian side.
The EU’s new curbs include a complete ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026.
Reliance said it was confident that its “time-tested, diversified crude sourcing strategy” would ensure stability in refinery operations for meeting the domestic and export requirements, including to Europe.
On Wednesday, an investigation by London’s Financial Times reported that HMEL had received several shipments of Russian crude transported via vessels later blacklisted under US and EU sanctions.
HMEL said it did not charter the vessels and had limited visibility over the transport chain. It said that the ship that delivered the crude to India “was not under” US sanctions at the time of delivery.
India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85pc of its oil needs.
Traditionally reliant on Middle Eastern producers, New Delhi started buying heavily discounted Russian crude in 2022, taking advantage of Western sanctions that limited Moscow’s export options.</p><small>2025-10-30 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301139079f71407.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952148/pakistan-agrees-to-resume-talks-with-afghanistan-at-turkiyes-request-security-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan agrees to resume talks with Afghanistan at Turkiye’s request: security sources</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has agreed to resume talks with the Afghan Taliban at the request of mediator Turkiye, security sources said on Thursday.
A security official said the Pakistani delegation present in Istanbul, where the second round of dialogue between the two countries had begun over the weekend, was about to return but would extend its stay there.
However, the source stressed that the discussions will be held on Pakistan’s “main demand” that Afghanistan takes “clear, verifiable and effective action” against terrorists.
It was decided to “give another chance to peace” by continuing the talks, the security official said. They added that Pakistan again underscored that Afghan soil is not used to carry out terrorist attacks against Pakistan.
 
 

Pakistan has witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides over the past few weeks engaging in border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
A first round of Pak-Afghan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19 had extended an initial 48-hour truce between the neighbouring countries. The Doha talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
The second round of dialogue in Istanbul, which was aimed at addressing terror attacks emanating from Afghan soil, failed to “bring about any workable solution”, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said late on Wednesday after four days of deliberations. The statement was followed by strongly worded remarks by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who warned Kabul of strikes deep in Afghanistan if terrorist activities continued to target Pakistan.
According to Asif, the Afghan Taliban acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
However, the other side “was not ready” to give the assurance in writing, despite agreeing with them, the minister told reporters at Parliament House yesterday.
Asif stated that Pakistan was not offered to include the TTP in the talks, and even if it had been, the proposal would not have been accepted. He said the Afghan delegation was in continuous contact with Kabul, which was colluding with India and preventing an agreement.
 
 

In a separate interview with Al Arabiya, the minister said he had evidence to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
Asif asserted that “India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score“ after the May conflict with Pakistan, where it was “defeated”.
Turkiye talks
The talks in Turkiye had began with the aim of finalising a mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
The agenda included dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad had planned to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing. Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
Additional priorities included securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.</p><small>2025-10-30 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3012140722d794c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952149/pakistan-win-silver-in-boys-volleyball-after-straight-set-defeat-to-iran-at-asian-youth-games' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan win silver in boys volleyball after straight-set defeat to Iran at Asian Youth Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s unbeaten streak at the Asian Youth Games came to an end on Wednesday night when Iran dominated the boys volleyball final in three straight sets to win gold, leaving the Green Shirts to take home a silver medal.
Pakistan put up a tough fight in all three sets but ultimately lost 25-21, 25-23, 25-23 to Iran.
The silver was Pakistan’s second medal at the ongoing games so far, with the boys Kabaddi team winning bronze last week.

The Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) said the team’s silver brought “immense pride and honour to the nation”.
“The team’s performance throughout the tournament was
exceptional — Pakistan did not lose a single match before the final, defeating teams like Mongolia, Bahrain, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and China with dominating performances,” the PVF said in a press release.
“The final match was a display of determination and courage, where the Pakistani players pushed hard in every set but were unfortunate to miss the gold medal by a close margin.
“Nevertheless, finishing undefeated until the final stands as a historic achievement for Pakistan volleyball at the youth level.”
Throughout the tournament, standout performances were delivered by Muhammad Yahya, Muhammad Anas, Muhammad Irfan, and Ajmal Junaid, PVF said.
The federation emphasised that the success was part of its “long-term development plan that started four years ago — from the U16 Asian Championship (Gold Medal) to the U18 Asian Championship, then the U19 World Championship, and now the Silver Medal at the 3rd Asian Youth Games 2025.”

Asif expressed these views during an interview with Al Arabiya English that was released late on Wednesday. His remarks are a continuation of the censure he has been directing toward Kabul in connection with terror incidents in Pakistan, recent border hostilities and the subsequent failure of talks with its Taliban rulers.
He was asked during his interview with Al Arabiya about the evidence he had to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
“When it comes to showing the evidence, or tabling the evidence, we will do that. We have the evidence,” Asif replied, highlighting that the Afghan foreign minister was visiting the Indian capital when border clashes began between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 


He went on to say that there was no doubt about Afghanistan having become an “Indian proxy”.
“And India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score [after] the last round we had around six or five months back, when they were squarely defeated. And they lost seven planes.
“The president of the United States has, on several occasions, mentioned — he even mentioned it yesterday — that seven beautiful planes were lost in the clash between India and Pakistan,” he added.
The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, and later raised the tally to seven.
US President Donald Trump has also mentioned the downing of seven jets during the conflict on multiple occasions, but has stopped short of elaborating on which side lost the jets.
When Asif again referred to the May episode in the context of hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the interviewer remarked that him saying India was trying to take revenge using another country was a very bold statement.
At that, Asif replied, “You want me to reiterate that statement? I will do that. I have no problem with that.” He continued that Kabul and New Delhi had a “relationship irrespective of the regimes in both countries”.
“There is a continuity to the relationship between the two countries, and it has always been to the detriment of Pakistan.”
Responding to a subsequent question, he also warned that in case of any violation on Pakistan’s eastern or western border — frontiers that the country shares with India and Afghanistan — Islamabad would respond effectively.
The defence minister further commented that Afghanistan had “chosen to become a stooge or proxy of India”.
Asked whether he saw a “broader or full-blown war” with Afghanistan on the horizon, the defence minister replied: “I won’t speculate about this, that there could be a full-blown war. But, there is a risk of [things] heating up, at least on the border. And obviously, if we have evidence of indulgence from across the border, we will retaliate. We will go inside and settle the score with them.”
The interviewer also asked him where Pakistan stood with regards to sending troops to become part of an international force in Gaza.
“We [have] already [said] on record that if need be we will be part of that force to maintain […] peace and tranquility and […] normalisation [of situation] in Gaza. Pakistan will always be willing to render its services in this regard,” replied Asif.

Only, to his torment, the boulder rolled back down every time it reached the top, trapping him in an endless cycle. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent announcement of Pakistan’s largest financing arrangement — a Rs1.225 trillion deal with 18 local banks to settle power-sector arrears — echoes this tragic myth.
Though the deal appears promising, offering hope of freeing the country from the shackles of power debt, it remains Sisyphean in nature: the state pushes the boulder of circular debt uphill, only for it to roll back down again, crushing consumers under the weight of revised tariffs.
Watt a deal!
The recent Rs1.225 trillion package comprises Rs660 billion for the restructuring of old loans and Rs565 billion in fresh funds to clear overdue payments, primarily owed to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) — private companies that generate electricity and sell it to the national grid. This hefty loan, secured from a consortium of 18 local banks, will be repaid over six years through the existing Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) — a small per-unit charge on electricity bills — of Rs3.23 per unit.
The deal does look golden. It provides much-needed relief to lawmakers, who can now turn their attention to other pressing challenges — perhaps even to the absurdities of Pakistan’s tax structure. By paying off long-overdue energy liabilities, the government averts the risk of being lambasted by the IPPs with late payment surcharges, steadying the cash cycle and ultimately the availability of electricity.
 
 

It may also have spared Pakistan’s “Leviathan” of foreign debt from growing further by wisely turning to local banks instead of external lenders. This approach helps rebuild investor confidence and could open the door for new investments.
Moreover, the decision to repay the loan through a ring-fenced plan tied to an existing DSS, rather than introducing a new tax, makes the move easier to justify to the public. And there might even be a faint silver lining in the government’s claim of “freeing up” Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees — essentially a government’s promise to repay certain debts if public entities default. While this doesn’t mean new cash in hand, it does create accounting headroom, allowing funds to be directed towards other crucial sectors.
Lighting the same fire, again and again
The government, it seems, has thought this one through. Yet, as Camus once warned, “the absurd lies not in the effort itself, but in repeating it without resolution”.
This “heroic” fix isn’t new; just a more sophisticated version of an old script. Yet, it remains the least bad among a set of imperfect choices. In 2013, Pakistan cleared roughly Rs480 billion in power sector debt. Six years later, in 2019, it did it again, this time around Rs400 billion, through two Pakistan Energy Sukuks (PES-I and PES-II) — government-backed Islamic bonds issued to quickly raise cash and pay off overdue bills to power producers.
Each time, the move was celebrated as a decisive blow against the sector’s chronic malaise. And yet, like Sisyphus condemned to his eternal climb, the boulder kept rolling back, only heavier with every descent. Why? The reasons are many.
Imagine the power sector as a pipeline of money that needs to flow smoothly — from customers to distribution companies (Discos), then to the central buyer (CPPA), on to power plants, and finally to fuel suppliers. Debt builds up when not enough cash passes through this pipeline.
 
 

This shortfall arises from several factors: transmission losses due to outdated and shabby infrastructure, electricity theft, which entails consuming power without payment, fixed capacity payments that must be made to producers even when energy isn’t dispatched, and under-collection when billed amounts are not fully recovered. This leaves the Discos cash-strapped, who underpay the central buyer, which in turn underpays power producers and fuel suppliers; late payment surcharges then accrue, worsening the deficit. This growing pile of unpaid payments is, in essence, circular debt.
This vicious cycle, with every inefficiency feeding another, mirrors Sisyphus’ misery. Camus suggested we must imagine Sisyphus happy, for in his struggle, he has acknowledged the certainty of his fate. However, Pakistan doesn’t have that luxury, as this fiscal ferris wheel has far-reaching implications. Circular debt makes power costly, as tariffs are hiked to make up for the cash deficit. It results in frequent shutdowns as power producers fail to pay for the fuel required to run their plants. Moreover, it drains public funding through recurring bailouts and guarantees, diverting the budget away from social welfare projects.
The irony is that to cauterise this oozing wound, Pakistan itself has relied on circular measures and has failed to sheathe the sword that cuts it anew. Although the deal is a welcome step, it only buys us time, not reform. To escape Sisyphus’ ill fate, the power sector must use this allowance to atone for its structural flaws — persistent losses, under-collections, crippling capacity payments, and costly subsidies.
The real power reform lies beyond bailouts
This begins with expanding the deployment of smart AMI meters (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) to improve recovery and introducing prepaid systems in areas where electricity theft is chronic.
Inefficient generation companies (Gencos) need to be retired, with their gap filled by cheaper renewable alternatives, easing the burden of hefty capacity payments. The Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) must be fully operationalised to encourage competitive pricing, alongside a comprehensive upgrade of the national grid to curb power losses.
Above all, tariffs must be cost-reflective, priced at what power truly costs. This, however, must be paired with targeted subsidies to protect lifeline consumers. And perhaps the sine qua non of power sector reform lies in insulating Discos from political patronage, whether through outright privatisation or performance-based concessions.
None of these reforms are new. National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank (WB) have repeated them ad nauseam.
Yet, until power losses are curtailed, subsidies rationalised, and governance overhauled, Pakistan will continue to hail each bailout as a breakthrough — only to find itself condemned to a Sisyphean fate.

His remarks after the face-to-face talks with  China’s leader Xi Jinping in the South Korean city of Busan, their first since 2019, marked the finale of Trump’s whirlwind Asia trip on which he also touted trade breakthroughs with South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.
The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, lasted nearly two hours. Trump shook hands and escorted Xi to his car before the US president was given a red carpet send off at the airport.
 






Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the meeting with Xi yielded an extendable one-year deal on the supply of crucial rare earths.
“All the rare earths has been settled, and that’s for the world,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the deal was for a year and would be re-negotiated annually.
He also described his meeting with Xi as a “great success” and said he would head to China in April for new talks.
“I’ll be going to China in April and he’ll be coming here sometime after that, whether it’s in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, DC,” Trump said.
“A lot of things we brought to finalisation” at Thursday’s talks in Busan, South Korea, added Trump, praising Xi as a “tremendous leader of a very powerful country”.
Chinese stocks climbed to a decade high and the yuan currency to a near one-year peak against the dollar as investors hoped for an easing of trade tensions that have upended supply chains and rocked global business confidence.
World stock markets from Wall Street to Tokyo have hit record highs in recent days.
Trump repeatedly talked up the prospect of reaching agreement with Xi since US negotiators on Sunday said they had agreed a framework with China that will avoid 100 per cent US tariffs on Chinese goods and achieve a deferral of China’s export curbs on rare earths, a sector it dominates.
But with both countries increasingly willing to play hardball over areas of economic and geopolitical competition, many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952075/warming-wired-world-becomes-playground-for-the-rich' target='_blank'><strong>‘Warming, wired world’ becomes playground for the rich</strong></a><br><p>

IN PAKISTAN, the wealthiest 10 per cent hold 42pc of the national income — lower than the average across major Asian economies, but still enough to create massive inequalities that make it impossible to build fair or sustainable societies.
This is one of the findings of an Oxfam report, highlighting uneven patterns of economic growth driven by widening wealth disparity, climate change and the digital divide.
Titled An Unequal Future: Asia’s Struggle for Justice in a Warming, Wired World, the report makes for grim reading: the richest 10pc capture 60-77pc of national income, while the poorest 50pc receive only 12-15pc; and the top 1pc own nearly half the wealth.
 






The report points out that in the past decade, the fortunes of Asian billionaires have more than doubled, whereas the poorest half of the population in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Korea, saw their share of income decline.

Oxfam report sees elite capture of wealth & income, climate crisis and digital divide as major challenges facing Asian nations

“The income share of the poorest 50pc has declined in almost all countries except Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam. The increase in these countries is also minimal, around 1pc, except in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myan­mar, the Philippines and Timor-Leste,” the report notes.
Dr Abid Aman Burki, who teaches poverty and inequality at Lahore University of Management Sciences, sees the report as a “bold attempt” at highlighting income and wealth disparities in the region.
“I think there is relevance for Pakistan,” notes Amitabh Behar, Executive Director at Oxfam International.
“Pakistan is among the countries in Asia hardest hit by floods and climate shocks, yet the richest continue to hoard wealth and dodge taxes, leaving ordinary people to face the worst of the destruction,” he told Dawn.
For the widening inequality in Pakistan, Dr Burki blames the current economic model. “It benefits the powerful elite with a tax system reliant on indirect taxes while disproportionately burdening low- and middle-income households.”
With public spending skewed towards debt repayment, defence, and subsidies for the elite, “there is very little left for health, education, and social protection” he added.
This assertion seems to be backed by Oxfam’s research: “In 2022, public investment in education amounted to 8pc of GDP in Bhutan and Kyrgyzstan, but less than 2pc of GDP in Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka,” the report states.
The report also details how indirect taxation disproportionately affects lower-income households. “In 2022, the tax-to-GDP ratio was at or above 30pc in Japan, Korea and New Zealand, compared to around 10pc in Laos and Pakistan.”
While countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have  moderate value-added taxes and strong social spending capacities, countries with high direct taxes, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, show continued reliance on indirect taxes. Hence, the burden still falls disproportionately on poorer households, it noted.
Climate, digital divide
However, economic reforms alone cannot close the widening gap between rich and poor; the climate crisis and the digital divide must also be addressed, as both deepen inequalities across the region, the report observes.
Nowhere is this more visible than in Asia, which the World Meterological Organisation terms the most “disaster-hit region”, recording over 1,800 events in the last decade, which claimed over 150,000 lives and affected over 1.2 billion.
Five of the world’s most vulnerable nations — Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — home to over 500 million people, bear the heaviest burden due to climate disasters.
To tackle and adapt to disasters, Asia requires around $1.11 trillion annually, but receives only $333bn, but much of this comes in the form of loans, the report notes ahead of the November COP30. “Wealthier nations continue to shirk their responsibility to pay for the climate damage they have caused in countries like Pakistan,” said Behar.
The report also emphasises the need to bridge the digital divide, which is largely defined by geography, affordability and social status. In the Asia-Pacific, 83pc of the urban population has access to the internet, compared to just 49pc in the rural areas.
“Across Asia, women, especially in South Asia, remain far less connected than men. Out of 885 million women in low- and middle-income countries not using mobile internet, 330 million live in South Asia,” the report states.
Pointing out the barriers such as affordability, low digital literacy, safety concerns, and unpaid care work, the report said these limit women’s access and exclude them from digital and tech-driven jobs.

The astronaut from Pakistan will be arranged to perform short-term mission as a payload expert, Xinhua reported China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) as announcing at a press conference.
It further reported that the arrangement for the astronaut was according to medium-term planning and cooperation progress of China’s space station mission. It added that the astronaut from Pakistan will train alongside Chinese astronauts.
 






China’s Global Times also reported that during the mission, the astronaut will not only participate in the crew’s routine work but will also conduct experiments on behalf of Pakistan.
 






In March, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the CMSA had signed a cooperation agreement for sending Pakistan’s first manned mission to China’s space station.
At the time, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had stated the agreement was “another wonderful gesture” from the Chinese government to further deepen bilateral cooperation in the field of space.
In April, the premier had also Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology. He also stressed that Pakistan was “giving utmost importance to the space technology sector”, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.</p><small>2025-10-30 05:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/6902a971cfd3e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952129/diagnosing-organised-crime' target='_blank'><strong>Diagnosing organised crime</strong></a><br><p>WHAT may appear as disparate events carried out by separate criminal syndicates are in fact manifestations of the overarching phenomenon of organised crime. For instance, the recent devastating floods in Swat, often attributed to climatic changes alone, were also driven by deforestation at the hands of the timber mafia. Similarly, the Lahore floods this year were caused not only by poor urban planning but also the illegal blocking of the city’s natural water courses by influential land grabbers.
In 2023, 350 Pakistanis drowned in a boat incident near Greece while being illegally smuggled into Europe. In another instance, the US INCS report of 2025 says that “mass quantities of drugs transit Pakistan’s maritime domain freely”, thanks to powerful transnational drug mafias. Widespread financial crimes in Pakistan, like money laundering and illicit financial flows, remain largely undiagnosed and undetected, eroding our economy, governance and national security. The US State Department estimates that around $10 billion is illegally funnelled out of Pakistan each year. This money is either obtained through corruption by public officials or are the proceeds of crime by powerful criminals, and sent abroad without detection.
As stated by Moisés Naím in Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy, “Organised crime should not be understood as isolated cartels but as pipelines through which illicit goods — drugs, arms, humans, illicit money — flow across borders and jurisdictions, often using the same routes and facilitators”.
 
 

In Pakistan, sadly, the state has consistently misdiagnosed them as isolated crimes rather than as interconnected criminal enterprises, facilitated by powerful state-embedded actors. Consequently, the pipelines of organised criminal networks stay largely intact, while law-enforcement agencies focus mostly on the arrest of their foot soldiers in sporadic raids. Targeting this wide spectrum of organised crime requires prioritisation according to the extent of harm caused, which requires an accurate diagnosis of the risk, based on data and evidence.
As the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime states, “Data is power in the fight against organised crime”. It follows that unless we plug the existing gaps in data collection and analyses, our diagnosis of organised crime in Pakistan shall continue to be inaccurate. The gaps in the diagnosis of organised crime in the country can be broadly divided into two categories — national and institutional.

Strong political will is needed to combat crime syndicates.

Since globally organised crime syndicates infiltrate government and political systems, strong political will is needed to combat them. In Pakistan, many cases have been reported in the media about how different types of mafias allegedly exert influence on official policymaking, like the sugar mafia, money laundering cartels etc. A case in point is Khanani & Kalia International, a Karachi-based, money-laundering syndicate, which was involved in worldwide transactions worth billions of dollars annually.
The arrest of its directors by FIA in 2008 and their subsequent acquittal by the court in 2011 indicates how the prosecution of powerful cartels works in Pakistan. There were reports of billions changing hands. Meanwhile, another director at KKI was arrested in the US in 2015 and convicted in 2017 for running a global money-laundering syndicate from Karachi worth billions of dollars annually. KKI was declared a transnational criminal organisation. Thus, the political will to address the challenge is uneven and depends on how politically powerful criminal networks are and what kind of organised crime they are involved in. Political will across the board to address all forms of organised crime is missing.
Meanwhile, the institutional response is fragmented. Institutions dealing with various forms of organised crime work in silos. Not only does this hinder the identification of cross-crime networks, it also results in two major gaps in diagnosing organised crime.
The first is the lack of a standardised national format for data maintenance by institutions dealing with different forms of organised crime, which impedes a uniform, holistic threat analysis across all institutions. Access to available data is limited, obstructing an objective and independent analysis of the issue.
Second, an essential aspect of diagnosing organised crime networks is accurate identification of corrupt public officials, or in the words of FATF, ‘politically exposed persons’ who may be facilitators of organised crime. The IMF is reported to have shared a draft with the Pakistan government in August 2025, pointing out that our system to identify politically exposed persons is “uneven”, implying that the more powerful you are, the less likely you are to be identified.
A multidimensional effort is needed to improve the diagnosis of organised crime in the country.
One, there is an urgent need to emphasise the gravity of the cross-sectoral impact of organised crime, which is missing in our national discourse. As per the UNODC, “harm caused by organised crime lies in its ability to simultaneously damage economies, weaken governance, fuel corruption, erode security and inflict severe social harm”. If left unchecked, it is likely to continue encroaching upon all segments of society, and as stated by Cornelis Roelofse, it can lead the country into “criminotocracy”, ie, “a system of governance where organised crime, governance and business, use the system for self-enrichment and manipulate the elections to remain in power”.
Two, the recently set-up Anti Money Laundering Authority should have adequate powers to meaningfully coordinate between different powerful stakeholders. For starters, it should draw up, in consultation with all relevant institutions, standardised formats of data maintenance to facilitate a holistic and comprehensive analysis of all forms of organised crimes in Pakistan, the harm these cause and their pipelines.
Similarly, the FATF’s 12th recommendation makes it mandatory for all relevant institutions in every country to improve systems to identify politically exposed persons. There is, thus, a need to get our act together before the FATF takes it up as a cause of concern.
The Global Organised Crime Index, 2023, rated Pakistan as a high-risk country with low resilience to deal with organised crime. That should ring alarm bells for course correction. It is for us to decide, whether we opt to identify and rein in these monstrous criminal syndicates, or allow ourselves to turn into a criminotocracy.

During the visit, PM She­­­hbaz also addressed the 9th edition of the Fut­ure Investment Initiative Conference besides holding meetings with heads of states and global business leaders.
 






In his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, the two sides agreed to launch economic framework, seeking to strengthen the role of both public and private sectors in promoting joint ventures.
Under the framework, several strategic and high-impact initiatives are being explored in sectors including energy, industry, mining and information technology
At the confere­nce, PM Shehbaz called for cooper­ation to support countries like Pakistan that have been battered by climate catastrophes, emp­hasising that loans should not be the only option for recovery.

My advice to him is to keep them running. It is good that he has formed working groups among them, who will develop more detailed proposals. Once the proposals are developed, they should form a committee to review them. After that should come a consultative process to circulate the proposals for wider input from civil society, civil servants and the State Bank. Then he should do something truly unprecedented: submit them for parliamentary review.
Standing committees in the House and Senate should then call members of these working groups to come and brief them about the proposals. After that, the same committees should call for wider public input from analysts and commentators. Wise guys like yours truly here would be happy to oblige with detailed comment on the pros and cons of each proposal. And after that comes the implementation stage, for which there should be an interdepartmental task force drawn from retired civil servants, members of parliament, independent experts and business leaders. But before that, it will be important to draw up the terms of reference for this task force, for which there should be a separate committee.
 
 

Here is a bold statement, and in the spirit of Gen Z era engagements, please prove me wrong. Nothing good has ever come out of these proposals the business community has been bringing to the government over the past half century. Of all the lasting policy measures in place today, or any catalysing policy steps taken over the decades, show me one example of a measure that was proposed by the business community which became the basis of lasting economic dynamism.
You would be hard-pressed to think of a single example because there are none. Pakistan’s business community has literally grown up thinking that it is the government’s job to help them make a profit. They press this point by subtle attempts at blackmail. ‘We will be forced to shut our plants down’ they say sometimes. Or ‘we will take our investments to another country’.

Nothing good has ever come out of the proposals the business community has been bringing to the government.

Simple fact here is that not one of these gents is fit to run any business in any country beyond maybe glorified rent-a-car services or, yes, a pizza franchise. It’s only in Pakistan that they make outlandish profits for minimal effort, where they privatise the gains but socialise the costs of the incentives the government provides them with, and where they can credibly lobby a government to do more to help make their business profitable. If they threaten to close their plants, call their bluff. They don’t create jobs on the scale they like to think, in any case. Certainly not by any comparison to the informal sector or agriculture. If they threaten to take their investments to foreign shores, welcome them. Those who can already have. Those who have not, cannot. And they know it.
 
 

But there are some things the business community should understand, to the marrow of their bones. One, the era of cheap energy is over. With Pakistan’s gas fields in advanced stages of decline and the grid weighed down by large-scale defections and high-capacity payments, the only way to bring energy costs down is via subsidies, and there should be zero appetite for that today. Two, the era of cheap money is also over. Over the years, these same business leaders have grown accustomed to cheap, subsidised credit provided by the State Bank through various schemes. But those schemes have been abused heavily, especially in the time of the PTI government when they were used to pump money into real estate rackets and inflate prices of speculative assets like plot files under the specious argument of using housing and construction as an engine of growth.
It was in response to this that the IMF basically required the State Bank to surrender the power to run such schemes altogether. This was a good step and has been taken now. These schemes pump printed money into the economy, which is captured first and foremost by the billionaire elites, converted into dollars and remitted into their accounts abroad. Then comes the inflationary pressure they inevitably create, as the supply of rupees in the economy rapidly outpaces the availability of dollars, and the ensuing mismatch between foreign currency and domestic liquidity in the system forces an abrupt exchange rate devaluation. The resulting inflation hits the poor, who have seen little to none of the benefits from the period of growth trickle down to them.
The story is the same with the interest rate. The State Bank has wisely held rates steady in the last three announcements, and should continue to do so until external sector pressures subside reliably. Maybe, the State Bank should announce some sort of external sector comfort threshold that must be crossed before further rate cuts can be considered. These can include reserve import cover crossing the three-month bar, forward liabilities of the State Bank below $1bn, the export to import ratio remaining stable within a narrow, predefined corridor for at least two quarters. This will help mute some of the annoying babble around CPI inflation and interest rates.
 
 

The business community must understand that things are changing, and they need to keep pace with a changing world. Energy-intensive industries will find it difficult to survive in the new world, if they don’t make their own arrangements for energy going forward. Speculative enterprises like real estate should be allowed to gasp for air long enough till they internalise the virtues of actually adding value to make money. But under no circumstances should government take it upon itself to help revive industry fortunes. This is a great moment to communicate a long overdue message to the freeloaders. It is time to adapt or die. Let them do what business people do everywhere else: work and take risks.

While Mr Khan is in jail, it is not clear who has been running his social media account. However, he has never disowned the messages shared from his X account.
“The continued delay in issuing notifications for Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as Leaders of the Opposition is deeply concerning,” the post said. “I demand that they be immediately notified as Leaders of the Opposition in the Senate and the National Assembly, respectively.”
 






The post also praised recent political rallies and urged followers to continue their efforts.

PTI leaders meet Fazl, seek his support for election to Senate seat

The post noted that the large turnouts at rallies in Charsadda, Khyber, and Karak demonstrate rising public awareness and a commitment to protecting rights. It also expressed appreciation to the organisers for their successful public outreach efforts.
The message instructed that PTI, in collaboration with the Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aaeen-i-Pakistan movement, “must now accelerate the struggle for true freedom.”
The former prime minister also addres­­sed internal party matters, clarifying communication protocols and leadership roles.
“To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, all instructions and correspondence concerning the party matters shall be conveyed solely through the Secretary General Salman Akram Raja,” the post stated.
It also affirmed his support for two party members, saying, “Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. … I have not issued any orders for their removal.”
Separately, Mr Khan’s party condemned Israel’s recent airstrikes in Gaza.
PTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram called on the international community, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, “to take immediate, decisive, and collective action to halt Israel’s aggression”.
The PTI also criticised the Adiala Jail administration for ignoring a court order regarding visitation rights for Khan. Mr Akram reported that despite clear instructions from the Islamabad High Court, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi and others were denied access.  He urged the IHC to take decisive action against those violating its orders and to restore Imran Khan’s right to meet his family, legal team, and political associates.
PTI meets JUI-F leader
Meanwhile, a PTI delegation visited the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Islamabad.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, said he proposed holding a national jirga to address security concerns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Maulana Fazlur Rehman assured support for the proposal,” Mr Qaiser said.
 






The PTI delegation also advocated for uniting opposition parties in Parliament and reached a consensus to nominate Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader. They also requested the JUI-F’s support for a vacant Senate seat from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.

As tomato prices crashed to Rs200 per kg after rising to a record Rs600-700 per kg, onion prices are likely to remain under pressure in the coming days due to a demand-supply gap.
As soon as the prices of perishable and non-perishable commodities rise substantially, consumers restrict their purchases to their daily requirements rather than buying in bulk.
Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway President Haji Shahjehan said supplies of onion from the new Sindh crop have started on a low note, which may pick up pace by the third week of November. Still, till then, prices may remain on the higher side.
He claimed that a small quantity is also arriving from Iran. Still, prices in the neighbouring country are high, and reports are coming in about problems with the clearance of Iranian onions at the border.
Shahjehan said that the markets lack any supply from Afghanistan due to the closure of Pak-Afghan trade for the last two weeks after clashes at the border between the two countries.
“The wholesale markets have been facing a shortage of onions for the last few days due to thin arrivals from the Sindh crop and limited imports from Iran,” he said, adding that the wholesale price of the main staple food items of the kitchen has swelled to Rs6,000-6,500 per 40 kg from Rs3,000-3,500 a few days back.
Currently, exports of onions have also been suspended due to very high prices, he said.
As in past practice, daily item prices issued by the Commissioner Karachi never match market prices. The official retail rate of onions is Rs104 per kg, but it is available at Rs200-220 per kg.
Market traders said that onion prices have also risen in some cities of Punjab, with reports that a 105-kg bag is now available at Rs23,000. They added that the Sindh crop is also finding its way into the Punjab areas.
As per the Sensitive Price Index data ending Oct 2, the national average price of onion in various cities ranged from Rs55-140 per kg, rising to Rs65-160 per kg in the week ending Oct 23.Economic Survey FY25 suggests that onion production during FY25 surged by 16pc to 2.670 million tonnes from 2.304m tonnes in FY24.

• Dismisses claim about 400 to 600 deaths in Muridke protest
LAHORE: Apparently under pressure from some religious groups, the Punjab government on Wednesday announced handing over the administrative control of the mosques and seminaries erstwhile being run by proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to a group of moderate clerics.
The administration led by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had earlier announced giving the administrative control of 300 mosques and 125 seminaries run by the TLP in the province to the Auqaf department.
Besides, CM Maryam ordered the release of TLP prisoners, who were fount innocent during the investigations.
At least eight people, including a policeman, were killed and over 1,600 injured in clashes between police and TLP supporters in Muridke earlier this month.
 
 

The Punjab police had arrested over 6,000 TLP activists so far following the violence, which was sparked by the outfit’s attempt to hold an anti-Israel demonstration outside the US embassy in Islamabad.
On Wednesday, a meeting of the Ittehad Bainul Muslimeen Committee was held with CM Maryam Nawaz in the chair.
Religious leaders from all schools of thought expressed full support for the Punjab government’s stance against the TLP and endorsed its efforts for maintaining peace.
 






In the meeting it was decided that the administration of the TLP-run mosques and seminaries would be handed over to the Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle Sunnat Pakistan led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
“Those who misuse religion for personal agendas are not serving the faith,” the CM noted.
“The mosques and seminaries are being handed over to Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman’s organisation for proper management,” she added.
Release of TLP supporters
The CM also ordered the immediate release of the TLP supporters, who were proven innocent, and instr­ucted officials to escort them home with “dignity”.
She dismissed the claim that 400 to 600 people were killed during the TLP protest in Muridke.
Referring to jailed former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, the Punjab CM said: “A person sitting in Adiala Jail tweets that 400 to 600 people died [in Muridke].”
She added that Mr Khan had been in jail for the last two years and still not stopped inciting sedition. “The lie of hundreds of people being killed was falsely spread. If it were true, where were the dead bodies?” she asked.
The CM further raised the question as to which hospitals provided medical treatment if thousands were injured.
“No videos of the injured and killed came to surface, but only those of raids and recoveries emerged,” she noted.
“When a police inspector was martyred, his funeral was held and everyone watched,” she continued, asking why were matters brought to such a tragic point that parents, wives, husbands and children were deprived of their loved ones.
The Punjab CM said everyone was surprised to see such a large number of weapons being recovered from TLP activists and supporters.
During police raids, she stated that modern weapons were recovered from TLP activists, including ones that even law enforcement agencies did not possess. “These arms were meant to be used against the state and the police.”
She denounced the harsh statements being made on social media about security personnel, adding that the agenda of those behind them was only to “defame religious and political parties”.
‘Miscreants creating divisions’
The CM observed that some people in religious groups were pious, guiding followers toward the truth. However, she asked: “who are those destroying property and taking innocent lives.”
She criticised the elements creating divisions among religious groups. She said certain miscreant groups were formed only to discredit and harm religious organisations.
“It is the state’s responsibility to protect the lives, property, and honour of citizens and to ensure daily life is not disrupted,” she added.
“The state was forced to act [against the TLP],” she said, continuing that while the world rejoiced over the Gaza ceasefire, some people in the country were calling for a march on Islamabad.
“Not once did these agitators [TLP] speak for Palestine. Instead, they incited violence against the police.”
She said using women as shields and hiding weapons in mosques was inhumane, referring to the TLP tactics.
The meeting was inf­o­rmed that all personnel deployed for the CM’s sec­urity were being screened following the crackdown against the TLP.
Besides, the security of the CM and some other members of her cabinet has been beefed up.
The CM announced a stipend of Rs25,000 per month for a prayer leader (imam) of each of the 65,000 mosques in the province.

“Because of other countries testing programmes, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said on Truth Social, ahead of the meeting with Xi in South Korea.
“Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years,” Trump noted.
 






President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells.
As Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
The United States last tested a nuclear weapon in 1992.
Tests provide evidence of what any new nuclear weapon will do — and whether older weapons still work.
Apart from providing technical data, such a test would be seen in Russia and China as a deliberate assertion of US strategic power.
The United States opened the nuclear era in July 1945 with the test of a 20-kiloton atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and then dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to end World War Two.</p><small>2025-10-30 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/300716216392194.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952099/no-confidence-motion-against-embattled-ajk-premier-ready' target='_blank'><strong>No-confidence motion against embattled AJK premier ready</strong></a><br><p>• PPP keeps cards close to chest as PML-N’s backing raises number of votes to 36
• ‘N’ vows to support the motion, not PPP’s candidate
ISLAMABAD: While a joint no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
Informed sources told Dawn that although only 14 signatures are required to submit a no-confidence motion, the number of signatories is much higher. Those who have signed include PML-N’s AJK chief Shah Ghulam Qadir, its parliamentary leader in AJK Legi­s­lative Assembly Raja Far­ooq Hai­der, and all six members of the forward bloc aligned with AJK Pr­e­sident Barrister Sultan Mehmood.
The PML-N has agreed to support the motion but, according to party sources, will not vote for the new prime minister from the PPP. The party’s ministers are expec­ted to resign after submission of the motion, and will sit on the opposition benches.
A day after a meeting at the Presidency in Islamabad decided that the PPP would form the government in AJK after unseating Anwarul Haq, 10 members of the forward bloc joined the PPP ranks, placing the party in a position to remove the AJK prime minister even without PML-N’s backing.
The development has raised the PPP’s strength from 17 to 27 members, matching the magic figure need­ed for a majority in the 53-member house.
Also, Muh­a­mmad Iqbal, a UK-based busi­nessman elected on a rese­rved seat for overseas Kashmiris, reportedly resigned.
With PML-N’s support, the total number of members ready to vote out Anwarul Haq rises to 36. A PPP source, however, claimed that the party already enjoyed the ‘open support’ of 37 members, with more in contact.
TV channels, citing party sources, reported that the PPP finalised Chaudhry Yasin, the president of PPP AJK, as its nominee for the office of prime minister, though he denied the media reports later in a post on X. He said the PPP leadership had not formally announced its nominee.
Sources said the formal announcement of the PPP nominee will be made after a meeting between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which could not take place on Wednesday.
In a related development, President Zardari chaired a meeting of senior party leaders, attended by PPP Chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Chaudhry Yaseen, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, and former AJK prime minister Sardar Yaqoob Khan.
The meeting focused on the political situation in Azad Kas­hmir, particularly the no-confidence motion against Anwa­rul Haq and the formation of a PPP government.
A meeting of PPP’s AJK parliamentary party will be held on Friday (tomorrow) at Zardari House. According to informed sources, the meeting will be chaired by PPP chairman, and the name of the next AJK PM will be announced afterwards.

Despite seed companies adhering to all agreed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the movement of wheat seeds between provinces has reportedly been hindered.
To address the issue, a meeting was held on the prime minister’s directives in Islamabad on Wednesday. 
During the meeting, chaired by National Food Security and Research Secretary Amir Muhyuddin, the provincial food departments clarified that all seed convoys with the necessary movement documentation were being allowed, and assured that instructions had been issued to food department authorities to facilitate the movement of wheat seeds as a priority.
A high-level supervisory committee, led by Mr Muhyuddin, has also been established to meet weekly on Wednesdays to monitor and review the progress of the inter-provincial wheat seed movement.
Furthermore, it was decided that officers from the Federal Seed Certi-fication and Research and Develop-ment will be deputed at check-posts on all inter-provincial routes connecting Punjab to other provinces. 
These officers will assist the food departments in the timely verification and movement of wheat seeds across provincial borders.
The meeting was attended by the secretaries of provincial agriculture and food departments, directors general of agriculture, and senior officials from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research.

Pakistan witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides engaging in recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Afghan Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But earlier today, Tarar announced that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
Elaborating more on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the information minister said: “The Afghan Taliban regime is completely responsible for the breakdown of the talks.
“When irrefutable evidence was given to them and their soil is being used against Pakistan’s sovereignty and for terrorist activities, and their people are involved with the TTP, then why are they resorting to evasion?”
The information minister added that Pakistan was thankful to Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating the talks, but said the Afghan Taliban had failed to agree on a unified agenda to stop terror attacks and take action against the groups responsible.
“How much more can we tolerate it?”
When asked about whether a ceasefire still existed after the failure of the talks, Tarar said: “Hope always remains for diplomatic efforts and it should always be there. Hope always remains in global issues that some diplomatic sources and matters will go towards peace, but rest assured: if their soil is used and we give them evidence of that, then Pakistan always has the right to respond for its self-defence.”
Questioned about the Taliban negotiators giving a verbal agreement but not a written undertaking to take action against the TTP, Tarar said that hesitating from signing the written agreement amounted to “hypocrisy” and asked if it was not evidence that “they want to support terrorists and are doing so”.
He questioned what more proof did the world need that the Afghan Taliban were not willing to stop terrorist activities and had malicious intent.
“Their word can’t be trusted, and their ill intent has come out openly. Why were they present in India when they conspired to attack Pakistan’s border?”
He said only “time will tell” how matters progressed from here on and border trade would remain shut for the time being due to the deadlock. “A final decision will be made in the next few days on what will be the future of all this.”
Conventional and proxy warfare advantage
Reiterating Pakistan’s military and diplomatic performance in the conflict against India, the information minister said about Afghanistan: “What do they think? Can they damage Pakistan through such activities? Absolutely not!”
He said there was no match between Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of conventional warfare, adding that “we will defeat them in proxy war[fare] too”.
When asked about the alleged threats made by the Taliban regime of striking Islamabad amid the current escalation, Tarar derided what he said was “propaganda warfare” and said Pakistan was not only effectively responding to it but would give a befitting response to it.
He maintained that said that the “unholy alliance” of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan would be snuffed out, while referring to the Afghan foreign minister’s remarks in India about occupied Kashmir during his visit to the country.
“Rest assured, if they attack through the border, or their soil is used, and we will present evidence of it before the world, it will be befittingly responded to. There will always be a response to attacking Pakistan or harming it; enough is enough. How long will they take Pakistan for granted?”
He added that, as per the UN Charter and international law, Pakistan had a right to respond if there was a direct or indirect attack on its territory and it could present evidence for it.
The minister questioned whether any other country would exhibit such restraint and give such leeway to the Afghan Taliban in the face of such attacks.
Tarar elaborated that the Pakistani state had a clear stance that Afghan soil should not be used for attacks on the former’s territory, nor should terrorists be facilitated by the latter; the movement of terrorists from the neighbouring country should also stop by respecting the integrity of international territorial borders and the interim Afghan authorities should take concrete action against terrorist elements.
The minister said there was a consensus in Pakistan that the above activities should stop. “Since the Afghan Taliban regime came to power, it has completely supported the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan join their formations.”
“Whenever there is an attack or terrorist activity in Pakistan, we show the whole nation and the world on television that Afghan nationals are oftentimes involved in them.”
He added that Pakistan had always desired peace and had played a constructive role, adding that the Taliban had violated the Doha agreement before as well and let down all parties to the deal.
“I think the Taliban regime does not have the support of the Afghan nation or the people. They want a war economy, but can’t sustain it.”</p><small>2025-10-29 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2923454665f2968.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952002/at-least-13-people-including-2-cops-injured-in-separate-attacks-across-balochistan-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 13 people, including 2 cops, injured in separate attacks across Balochistan: officials</strong></a><br><p>At least 13 people, including two police officials, were injured as two separate attacks were reported in Balochistan on Wednesday, according to local officials.
A grenade attack on a police mobile was reported along the national highway in the province’s Dera Murad Jamali area, which injured 13 people, including 2 officers.
According to police officials, unknown suspects attacked the vehicle while it was patrolling along the highway.
Immediately after the attack, police and law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and started an investigation into the incident, while security in the area was tightened.
Civil Hospital Dera Murad Jamali Medical Superintendent Dr Naseer Ahmed Imrani confirmed that 13 people, including two policemen, were injured in the attack and transported to the facility.
“A woman and two children are also among the injured, who are being provided medical assistance,” Imrani said. “The police have started investigating the incident.”
Meanwhile, Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ghulam Sarwar Bhiyo told local journalists that unidentified suspects fired four rockets at Jaffar Express on the railway track near Nutal.
“The attack was on the Jaffar Express, but fortunately, there was no loss of life,” he said. “FC and police personnel immediately retaliated, as a result of which the attackers fled the scene.”
Police officials said that the incident took place at Altafabad, where four rockets were fired, but the train safely reached Dera Murad Jamali railway station.
Security forces reached the area and established a cordon to sanitise the incident site.
“The Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail have been sent to Jacobabad after clearance from Dera Murad Jamali,” SSP Bhiyo said. “After the incident, security forces have further tightened security around the railway track.”</p><small>2025-10-29 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29224057ad4827e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951998/captain-among-six-army-soldiers-martyred-in-kurram-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Captain among six army soldiers martyred in Kurram IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the general area of Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij, a term designating members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, seven Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the statement read.
However, Captain Noman Saleem (24, resident of Mianwali), Havaldar Amjad Ali (39, resident of Swabi), Naik Waqas Ahmad (36, resident of Rawalpindi), Sepoy Aijaz Ali (23, resident of Shikarpur), Sepoy Muhammad Waleed (23, resident of Jhelum) and Sepoy Muhammad Shahbaz (32, resident of Khairpur) were all martyred in the gun battle.
Captain Noman was “a brave young medical officer who, besides performing the duties of medical care, also fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his five men,” the statement added.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as relentless counter terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
On Sunday, security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, according to the ISPR.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-10-29 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2922050571d5f6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951994/pti-will-stand-with-pakistan-if-afghan-hostilities-resume-says-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will stand with Pakistan if Afghan hostilities resume, says Gohar</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party would stand with Pakistan if hostilities with Afghanistan resume.
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent weeks, which saw border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Responding to a question on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Gohar said that the PTI would stand with Pakistan in case hostilities with Afghanistan erupt once again, like they did during Islamabad’s brief war with India in May.
“We will stand with Pakistan like we did during the war with India, Afghanistan will not be any different,” he said. “But I will say that Pakistan has to live with its neighbours and it’s in its best interest to live peacefully.”
The PTI chairman quoted a saying in relation to the Afghan situation: “The one who has the most at stake must exhaust all avenues.”
“We have a lot at stake; if Afghanistan has a dialogue going, we need to try other avenues until we reach a consensus,” he stated. “As far as the Afghanistan situation is concerned, it is a serious one, because the Taliban do not completely control the country.”
“If the Afghan Taliban attacked Pakistan, obviously, the response would be like with India, but that does not mean that talking stops during war. Dialogue should happen by all means, but right now, especially, nations friendly to Pakistan should try and use their influence and talk to the Taliban.”
The PTI chairman also noted that Pakistan has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter, but that “Afghanistan has the same right”.
“As neighbours, we need to understand each other,” he said.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. They, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.

As United States President Donald Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22.
There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon, named after the ancient Greek god of the sea, but it is essentially a nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone.
Putin, over tea and cakes at a hospital in Moscow with Russian soldiers wounded in the Ukraine war, said the test had taken place on Tuesday.
“For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,” Putin said.
“There is nothing like this,” he said, adding there was no way to intercept the Poseidon, which analysts believe has a range of 10,000 kilometres and can travel at about 185km per hour.
The Burevestnik and Poseidon tests are intended to send a clear message that Russia, in Putin’s words, will never bow to Western pressure over the war in Ukraine.
For Trump, who has called Russia a “paper tiger” for failing to swiftly subdue Ukraine, the message is that Russia remains a global military competitor, especially on nuclear weapons, and that Moscow’s overtures on nuclear arms control should be acted on.
Poseidon and the new nuclear arms race
The Poseidon is a new weapon that has appeared amid what Putin has cast as a global arms race — primarily between the United States, Russia and China — to modernise and develop their nuclear arsenals.
Poseidon, known in Nato as Kanyon, is 20 metres long, 1.8 metres in diameter and weighs 100 tonnes, according to Russian media.
Arms control experts say the weapon breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. They have estimated it would carry a two megaton warhead and perhaps is powered with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Putin said Poseidon’s power exceeded that of “even our most promising Sarmat intercontinental-range missile”, which is known as SS-X-29, or Satan II.
Since first announcing the Poseidon and Burevestnik in 2018, Putin has cast them as a response to US moves to build a missile defence shield after Washington in 2001 unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as well as to Nato’s eastern enlargement.
After Russia’s test of the Burevestnik, Trump said Putin should end the war in Ukraine instead of testing a nuclear-powered missile.</p><small>2025-10-29 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/29171916f222b18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951977/social-media-post-case-imaan-mazaris-husband-arrested-at-islamabad-court-for-intentionally-not-appearing' target='_blank'><strong>Social media post case: Imaan Mazari’s husband arrested at Islamabad court for ‘intentionally not appearing’</strong></a><br><p>Hadi Ali Chattha, husband of rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, was arrested from outside the courtroom in Islamabad on Wednesday in a case related to controversial social media posts.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued an arrest warrant for him at the hearing and adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow.
Mazari also posted on X about the arrest, saying: “My husband, Hadi Ali, has been arrested because Judge Majoka is insistent on committing misconduct. Hadi appeared in court today and despite his appearance the … judge ordered his arrest.”
Sharing a picture of the short order, she termed it “completely illegal” in a subsequent post, saying there was video evidence inside and outside the courtroom of Hadi being present.
“Today case was fixed for framing of charge and prosecution evidence. Hadi Ali Chattha accused has intentionally not appeared in court. Hence, his bail bonds are forfeited and non-bailable warrant of arrest be issued against him” for tomorrow, the short order said.
In a video shared by journalist Matiullah Jan on X, Chattha claimed there had been three hearings in the case since morning and he was present in the courtroom but the judge had refused to come out from his chambers while conveying the message that he would issue an arrest warrant for him.
“I am saying to him that I am present so why will you issue my arrest warrant. If there is any proceeding then tell me I am present in court. This is misconduct that he is refusing to come out from his chambers and is saying from inside: ‘No, you go away and I want to issue your arrest warrant.’”
Chattha said it would be a “great injustice” if lawyers were tried in courts, proceedings were not conducted and then judges said that they would issue arrest warrants for them no matter what.
 






Journalist Saqib Bashir said the entire situation was “surprising” since arrest warrants were issued to ensure appearance in court and were normally cancelled when those undergoing trial appeared in court.
 






Journalist Baqi Sajjad termed the arrest a “continuation of the persecution of the human rights activists”.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The case has been registered under Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.</p><small>2025-10-29 13:21</small></div><hr>
