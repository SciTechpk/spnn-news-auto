<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22231532e59114a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950600/pm-shehbaz-discusses-countrys-political-landscape-with-kp-lawmakers-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz discusses country’s political landscape with KP lawmakers, leaders</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Wednesday held a meeting with lawmakers and political leaders from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and discussed the “overall political landscape” in the country with them, said a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
“PM Shehbaz discussed the current overall political landscape with KP lawmakers and leaders, as well as reviewed progress on ongoing development projects in the province,” said the statement.
“The meeting focused on federal efforts to boost socio-economic development in KP and enhance coordination between the Centre and provincial stakeholders,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier stressed the “need for sustained political engagement to ensure stability and growth in the province,” the report said.
During the meeting, PM Shehbaz “emphasised that KP remains a key priority in the national agenda”.
The prime minister also “directed relevant authorities to expedite key infrastructure and welfare projects”.
The PTI-led KP government’s relationship with the federal government has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks, particularly on the matter of counter-terrorism efforts.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements.
On October 20, the newly elected KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
He also criticised the Centre for not providing KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism or “other Constitutional rights.”</p><small>2025-10-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22193555b1fc83f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950576/explainer-how-india-new-zealand-and-sri-lanka-can-still-make-the-womens-world-cup-semi-finals' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: How India, New Zealand and Sri Lanka can still make the Women’s World Cup semi-finals</strong></a><br><p>Three teams are chasing the last vacant spot in the ICC Women’s World Cup semi-final after South Africa, Australia and England booked their place during the knockout stage and finished top three in the league’s standings.
India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand are chasing the coveted spot with four points each; Bangladesh and Pakistan are out of contention and at the bottom of the standings with two points each, with the latter crashing out of contention after a crushing defeat by South Africa on Tuesday.
 


How India can qualify (currently in fourth position; +0.526 NRR)
India have two remaining matches against New Zealand on Thursday and Bangladesh on Sunday. If they win both, they progress to the semi-finals. Even if they win against New Zealand but not Bangladesh — which gives them six points and a total of three victories, they can still qualify for the semis.
If India lose to New Zealand but defeat Bangladesh, they will be relying on England defeating the White Ferns on Sunday in order to make the semis. Losing against both teams will mean India would crash out of a tournament they are hosting.
India has registered two wins so far; an 88-run defeat to Pakistan and a 59-run win over Sri Lanka through the DLS method. The Women in Blue lost to England by four runs in a nail-biting encounter on home soil, and lost to South Africa by three wickets.
How New Zealand can qualify (currently in 5th position; -0.245 NRR)
In the event that New Zealand defeat both India and England in their remaining matches, they accrue a total of eight points and qualify for the semis.
However, a win against India but a loss to England means the Kiwis will rely on Bangladesh to defeat India and their net run rate finishing higher than Sri Lanka (or Pakistan defeating Sri Lanka).
Of the five matches the Kiwis have played so far, New Zealand has only won against Bangladesh by 100 runs. They lost to South Africa by 6 wickets and to Australia by 89 runs, while the matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka were both washed out.
 






How Sri Lanka can qualify (currently in 6th position; -1.035 NRR)
Sri Lanka’s chances of securing a spot in the semis are slim and rely on other teams’ outcomes more than their own performance.
They would have to defeat Pakistan on Friday, require India to lose to both New Zealand and Banglades, and require New Zealand to lose to England for their net run rate to finish higher than the Kiwis.
Sri Lanka recorded their first win on Monday after edging out Bangladesh in a nerve-jangling finish after skipper Chamari Athapaththu took the ball herself and turned the game on its head.
They lost to England by 89 runs and to South Africa by 10 wickets through the DLS method, while the match against Australia was abandoned without a ball being bowled.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22212621569d1e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950590/climate-change-population-growth-hindering-pakistan-from-becoming-3tr-economy-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Climate change, population growth hindering Pakistan from becoming $3tr economy: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that unchecked population growth and climate change are hindering Pakistan from becoming a $3 trillion economy.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
At the same time, Pakistan has been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025.
“I have been clear right from the beginning that we have two existential issues because if we don’t tackle them correctly … there are two reasons that could derail us from becoming a $3tr economy and those are climate change and population growth,” said the finance minister in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’.
Aurangzeb said the former was no longer merely “an academic discussion” but something “we are living day in and day out”, pointing to the onset of the smog season in Lahore and the recent flood which devastated large tracts of Pakistan.
The finance czar said the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events were increasing, adding that he had participated in three forums during the last week that discussed the matter of climate change.
 
 

“There is no way to put a value on the precious human lives we have lost,” he said of the deaths in the recent floods and climate disasters overall, adding that the growth goal for this year was targeted at 4.2pc but “there is no doubt now that at least 0.4-0.5pc will be shaved off.”
He stated that 80pc of the damage caused by the recent floods was sustained in Punjab, predominantly impacting the agriculture sector, especially rice and cotton-producing regions.
Regarding the government measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, the finance minister said Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik was tasked by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to devise a plan for the next 300 days.
MNCs exiting Pakistan
 
 

Questioned about the recent high-profile departures of multinational companies from the country, Aurangzeb said there were multiple aspects to the issue.
“These global companies make decisions on their participation regarding which clients to stay with, which products to stay with and in which countries to remain.”
Mentioning his own past example, he pointed to the exit of the Royal Bank of Scotland from Pakistan, adding that the entity had decided at the time to exit all global money markets.
He further said that while some companies were indeed exiting, some entered the market during the past three to four years, pointing to Aramco and others.
There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here. Some of the prominent ones include Procter & Gamble, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10pc annually, over the last two years.
Stability but no growth due to no reforms: Miftah Ismail
Meanwhile, speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said that while stability was indeed achieved, key reforms were needed for growth but they were not carried out and instead the government had not reduced its expenses but raised taxes, thus dampening demand.
He also pointed to the lack of reduction in the share of the provinces in the National Finance Commission award as a reason for lack of growth.
The former finance minister also criticised government sprawl at the federal and provincial levels, saying: “If the government steps back just a little, the private sector will handle it.”
Ismail said there was a lack of incentive for foreign companies to enter the country with his high taxation and utility costs for gas and electricity. He added that the entire energy infrastructure of the country needed a rehaul to move away to more cheaper methods such as solar and wind.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22221726d6dd2ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950595/pakistan-will-not-travel-to-india-for-junior-hockey-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not travel to India for Junior Hockey World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Hockey Federation on Wednesday finalised its decision to not send its team to India for next month’s Junior World Cup, slated to held from Nov 28 to Dec 10.
The decision came after a high-profile meeting in Islamabad where the security issues and India’s hostile approach towards Pakistan in the sports sector, particularly the conduct of its cricket team during the recent Asia Cup, came under discussion.
“The PHF will convey its decision to Hockey India soon,” a PHF official told Dawn.com. “The PHF and the government don’t want to compromise on security of players, therefore we decided not to send our team.”
International Cricket Council, the sports global body, has arranged for neutral venues for both Pakistan and India during tournaments held in either country. Hockey’s governing body, the FIH, however, hasn’t made any such hybrid arrangement. Pakistan skipped the Asia Cup in India last month despite the tournament being a qualifier for next year’s World Cup.
Meanwhile, the issue of PHF elections was taken by the National Assembly Standing Committee on Inter Provincial Coordination, which met here at under the Chairmanship of MNA Sheikh Aftab Ahmed.
During the course of meeting, the convener of sub-committee presented a report on the PHF. The committee was told that the PHF had agreed to conduct the scrutiny of clubs and elections of committee.
During the meeting, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid told the committee that issue of elections of PHF and scrutiny of clubs will be placed before the Executive Committee of PHF in its meeting on November 7 and a subsequent announcement will be made.
The committee directed the PHF that the election commission should be formed with representation of Pakistan Sports Board while club scrutiny should be carried out with consultation and representation of PSB.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221947204cf122f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950585/world-court-says-israel-must-ensure-basic-needs-in-gaza-are-met' target='_blank'><strong>World Court says Israel must ensure basic needs in Gaza are met</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations’ top legal body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), on Wednesday said Israel has an obligation to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met.
The panel of 11 judges added that Israel is forced to support the relief efforts provided by the United Nations in the Gaza strip and its entities, including the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Israel has not substantiated its claims that a significant number of UNRWA’s employees are members of Hamas, the judges said.
The ICJ said that Israel was obliged to ease the passage of aid into Gaza, stressing it had to provide Palestinians with “basic needs” essential to survival.
 






The wide-ranging ICJ ruling came as aid groups are scrambling to scale up much-needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza, seizing upon a fragile ceasefire agreed earlier this month.
The ICJ’s “Advisory Opinion” is not legally binding but the court believes it carries “great legal weight and moral authority”.
Israel did not take part in the proceedings but an official told journalists before the hearing that it was “an abuse of international law”.
The official added that Israel “cooperates with international organisations, with other UN agencies regarding Gaza. But Israel will not cooperate with UNRWA”.
ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa said the ICJ “rejects the argument that the request abuses and weaponises the international judicial process”.
 






On the eve of the ICJ ruling, Abeer Etefa, Middle East spokeswoman for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), said 530 of the organisation’s trucks had crossed into Gaza since the ceasefire.
Those trucks had delivered more than 6,700 tonnes of food, which she said was “enough for close to half a million people for two weeks”.
Etefa said around 750 tonnes a day were now coming through, which, although more than before the ceasefire, remains well below WFP’s target of around 2,000 tonnes daily.
The ICJ said that Israel, as an occupying power, was under an obligation “to ensure the basic needs of the local population, including the supplies essential for their survival”.
At the same time, Israel was “also under a negative obligation not to impede the provision of these supplies”, the court said.
The court also recalled the obligation under international law not to use starvation as a method of warfare.
 






‘Serious concerns’
The UN had asked the ICJ to clarify Israel’s obligations, as an occupying power, towards UN and other bodies “including to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival” of Palestinians.
ICJ judges heard a week of evidence in April from dozens of nations and organisations, much of which revolved around the status of UNRWA.
At the ICJ hearings, a US official raised “serious concerns” about UNRWA’s impartiality, and alleged that Hamas used the agency’s facilities.
The US official, Josh Simmons, said Israel had “no obligation to permit UNRWA specifically to provide humanitarian assistance”.
Simmons added that UNRWA was not the only option for delivering aid into Gaza.
However, the ICJ noted that UNRWA “cannot be replaced on short notice without a proper transition plan”.
Palestinian official Ammar Hijazi told the ICJ judges during the April hearings that Israel was blocking aid as a “weapon of war”, sparking starvation in Gaza.
Wednesday’s case was separate from the others Israel faces under international law over its campaign in Gaza.
In July 2024, the ICJ issued another advisory opinion stating that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories was “unlawful” and must end as soon as possible.
ICJ judges are also weighing accusations, brought by South Africa, that Israel has broken the 1948 UN Genocide Convention with its actions in Gaza.
Another court in The Hague, the International Criminal Court, has issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was killed in an airstrike.</p><small>2025-10-22 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2220214867e267a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950589/how-will-the-next-un-chief-be-chosen-and-who-wants-the-job' target='_blank'><strong>How will the next UN chief be chosen and who wants the job?</strong></a><br><p>A new United Nations secretary-general will be elected next year for a five-year term starting on January 1, 2027.
Here are the potential candidates so far and how the successor to current UN chief Antonio Guterres will be chosen:
When does the process start?
The race will formally start when the 15-member Security Council and the president of the 193-member General Assembly send a joint letter soliciting nominations.
That letter is due to be sent by the end of the year. A candidate has to be nominated by a UN member state.
The job traditionally rotates among regions, but when Guterres — who is from Portugal — was elected in 2016, it was supposed to be Eastern Europe’s turn. Next on the list is Latin America; however, some diplomats expect candidates from other regions.
Who wants to be the next secretary-general?
While the race doesn’t formally begin until the letter is sent by the presidents of the Security Council and the General Assembly, there are already several publicly declared candidates:
Michelle Bachelet — Chile: Chile will nominate the country’s former president, Michelle Bachelet, President Gabriel Boric said on September 23, 2025. Bachelet was Chile’s first female head of state and served as president of the South American nation twice. Bachelet was UN High Commissioner for Human Rights between 2018-2022 and executive director of UN Women between 2010-2013.
Rebeca Grynspan — Costa Rica: Costa Rica will nominate former Vice President Rebeca Grynspan, President Rodrigo Chaves said on October 8, 2025. Grynspan, a 69-year-old politician and economist, currently serves as Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
Rafael Grossi — Argentina: Grossi has long said he was considering campaigning to be secretary-general. When asked by Reuters on September 3, 2025 if he was definitely going to run, he said: “Yes, I am going to do that, yes.” A veteran Argentinian diplomat, Grossi is director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a role he has held since 2019.
What is the process?
The 15-member Security Council will formally recommend a candidate to the 193-member General Assembly for election as the 10th UN secretary-general later next year.
The Security Council will hold secret ballots — referred to as a straw poll — until a consensus is reached on a candidate. The choices council members are given for each candidate in the straw poll are: encourage, discourage or no opinion.
Ultimately, the five permanent veto-wielding council members — the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France — must agree on a candidate.
The ballots for the veto powers in the straw poll are traditionally a different colour from those of the 10 elected members. When Guterres was chosen in 2016 to be recommended to the General Assembly, it took six straw polls for the Security Council to reach agreement.
The Security Council then adopts a resolution, traditionally behind closed doors, recommending an appointment to the General Assembly. The resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes to pass.
The General Assembly’s approval of the appointment of a secretary-general has long been seen as a rubber stamp.
How transparent is the process?
The United Nations has been working to improve the transparency of the historically opaque selection process.
The General Assembly, in a resolution adopted in September 2025, said each candidate should provide a vision statement when they are formally nominated and be given the opportunity to present it. It said the vision statement should also be publicised on a dedicated United Nations web page.
The Assembly said each candidate should disclose their sources of funding and that any candidates who already hold a UN position “should consider suspending their work in the United Nations system during the campaign, with a view to avoiding any conflict of interest that may arise from their functions and adjacent advantages.”
What does the secretary-general do?
The UN Charter calls the secretary-general the “chief administrative officer” of the world body. The UN website describes the role as “equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and chief executive officer.”
Guterres currently oversees more than 30,000 civilian staff and 11 peacekeeping operations with around 60,000 troops and police. The core annual United Nations budget is $3.7 billion, while the peacekeeping budget is $5.6bn.
Since the power to authorise military force or sanctions rests with the Security Council, the UN chief has little more than a bully pulpit. Many diplomats say the five council veto powers prefer a “secretary” rather than a “general.”
Has a woman ever been secretary-general?
No. There is a growing push for the United Nations to choose the first female secretary-general in its 80-year history.
In the resolution adopted in September, the General Assembly noted “with regret that no woman has ever held the position of Secretary-General” and encouraged countries to “strongly consider nominating women as candidates.”

The policy, approved earlier this month, will allow dacoits to surrender arms in return for assurances of protection for their families, rehabilitation and livelihood support.
For decades, dozens of dacoit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and looting people on highways have become a daily reality.
According to a press release from the home department, “Around 72 dacoits surrendered under the Sindh Surrender Policy, and laid down more than 200 small-scale and heavy ammunition.”
The weapons include: 62 G3 rifles, 97 submachine guns, 48 double-barreled guns, two RPG 7s, an anti-tank recoilless rifle and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun.
The dacoits who surrendered had a cumulative bounty of Rs60 million on their heads, the press release said.
Earlier, at a ceremony held to mark the official launch of the policy, a Rangers sector commander said, “Today, more than 70 dacoits have surrendered themselves to the law, and 209 weapons have been laid down,” according to a separate press release from the home department.
The ceremony was held at the Senior Superintendent of Police’s office in Shikarpur, where Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar was the chief guest.
In attendance at the ceremony were: Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Larkana, officers of Sindh Rangers, and other officials. Also present were MPA Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh, Shehryar Mahar, Abid Bhayo, Gul Muhammad Jakhrani, and other leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party, the press release said.
The Rangers official detailed that till now “a total of 282 dacoits had applied for surrender under the policy, out of which 70 requests have been approved”.
Addressing the dacoits at the ceremony, the home minister said, “You have taken a commendable step by surrendering yourselves to the law because it reflects your desire to become law-abiding and peaceful citizens.“
“After serving your sentences, you will once again become part of the peace-loving community of this city and country,” he added.
The minister further directed their fellow dacoits to follow suit so their families living in the riverine areas can receive basic facilities, issuing a warning that: “Surrender yourselves, otherwise we will come for you inside your hideouts, because you are enemies of poor people and their property.”
The minister, in his address, also “appreciated tribal chiefs for their cooperation with the government on the matter”.
Lanjar assured the dacoits that the “Sindh government wants to ensure education and a bright future for the children of those who have surrendered”.
On the matter of the law and order situation in Sindh, IGP Sindh noted that the situation was “gradually improving.”
“Kidnapping for ransom had been a challenge for over 40 years, but it has now almost ended, and areas once filled with dacoits are now completely cleared,” he was quoted as saying.
“A total of 171 dacoits have been killed, and 421 have been captured [and] injured during police operations. This is our greatest success,” he was quoted as saying.
Sindh Surrender Policy
On October 7, the Sindh cabinet okayed a policy to allow dacoit gangs in the riverine areas of the province to lay down their arms and surrender in return for assurances from the government.
Officials told the cabinet members that following successful security operations and extensive negotiations with local communities, many dacoits had expressed willingness to surrender voluntarily.
The main features of the policy include mandatory disarmament, protection of families, rehabilitation and livelihood support and access to education, healthcare and vocational training.
The provincial government would also revive schools, health, veterinary and development projects in the riverine areas to sustain peace and stability.
However, as per the policy, surrender does not mean pardon or immunity, and all surrendering individuals will face the prevailing law of the land.</p><small>2025-10-22 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22172131cbb3503.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950577/pti-announces-massive-public-rally-in-karachi-to-kick-off-nationwide-public-engagement-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces ‘massive public rally’ in Karachi to kick off nationwide public engagement campaign</strong></a><br><p>The PTI announced on Wednesday that a “massive public rally” would be held in Karachi during the month of November to kick off a nationwide public engagement campaign.
A press release issued today said the decision was taken during PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja’s visit to Karachi. During his visit, he met party leaders, including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, PTI Parliamentary Leader Shabbir Qureshi and Jamal Siddiqui.
Raja held detailed discussions on the prevailing political situation, strategy for party founder Imran Khan’s release and organisational matters.
Addressing the media after the meetings, Raja announced that a “massive public rally will be held in Karachi” in November, followed by similar gatherings in Hyderabad and other major cities as part of a nationwide public engagement campaign.
The senior PTI leader added that the party was united and mobilised for Imran’s release.
 
 

He informed those present that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated as opposition leader in the National Assembly and Raja Nasir Abbas in the Senate, while Sohail Afridi had been appointed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, terming the recent moves as symbolising “a wave of political renewal within PTI”.
“We stand firm for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” Barrister Raja said. “Truth and justice will prevail. All cases fabricated against Imran Khan are proving false in the courts. However, delaying tactics are being used to hinder justice, but these baseless cases will soon be over.”
Reiterating Imran’s message to the nation, Raja said: “Patron in Chief Imran Khan has urged the people to keep faith in Allah Almighty; victory always belongs to truth. He has directed the party to reach out to the public through rallies across the country to raise awareness against oppression and injustice.”
Expressing grave concern over the situation in Sindh, Raja said that the PPP had “in the last 17 years … turned Sindh into ruins”.
He noted that from Karachi to the interior of the province, cities were in a state of decay, adding that lawlessness and insecurity had made life miserable for citizens.
Raja said he had personally visited several cities of Sindh and found a “scene of desolation and hopelessness everywhere“.
“Rampant corruption by the PPP has plundered Sindh’s public resources,” he asserted. “But the people of Sindh are now awake. Wherever we went, we witnessed overwhelming support for Imran Khan. The people of Sindh want change; they want a leader like Imran Khan: honest, brave, and dedicated to the nation.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
The party said last week that Imran has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole.
The party had also aired concerns earlier this month about Imran being transferred from Adiala Jail to some unknown location to prevent his access to his family and legal team.</p><small>2025-10-22 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22165639411776e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950570/saudi-arabia-bans-employers-from-charging-domestic-workers-for-recruitment-work-permit' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia bans employers from charging domestic workers for recruitment, work permit</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia has banned employers from charging any fees to their domestic workers, including for recruitment and work permits, setting maximum penalties of a fine worth 20,000 riyals (SR) and a three-year ban on hiring, according to Saudi Gazette.
The Saudi outlet reported on Monday that employers were banned from “charging any fees from their domestic workers”, including those “related to recruitment, change of professions, transfer of services, residency permit (iqama) and work permits”.
 






Saudi Gazette said the provisions were included in the “Guide to the Rights and Obligations of Domestic Workers”, issued by the Saudi human resources ministry. It added that the new regulations “include a package of rights that guarantee the domestic worker a decent life and a stable work environment”.
According to a guide available on the Saudi human resources ministry’s website, professions/jobs permitted by law in the domestic worker sector include “domestic worker, private driver, educator, home nurse, home cook, home planning, home travel, home life, home manager, home guard, home farmer, home coffee-maker, personal assistant, and physical therapy specialist”.
The guidelines also allow the addition of any other profession that may be within household tasks.
The guide defines a domestic worker as any person “who performs domestic work or the like directly or indirectly for the domestic employer and any member of the staff under his supervision who performs domestic work or someone who takes his place”.
 
 

To deter violations, the regulations set a “financial fine that may reach up to SR20,000, in addition to the possibility of being banned from recruiting for a period of up to three years”.
The ban may be extended to become permanent in some cases, with the penalty doubled in case of repeated violation, the report added.
Meanwhile, the regulations also mandate domestic workers to ensure proper conduct, including taking care of the employer’s property, maintaining household secrets, respecting Islam and keeping societal values and morals in mind.
A domestic worker who violates the regulations will face a fine of up to SR2,000, or a permanent ban on working in Saudi Arabia, or both.
“Fines shall be multiplied by the number of violations proven against the domestic worker. The violating domestic worker shall bear the costs of his return to his home country,” the guide stated.
According to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, over 2.05 million Pakistani workers, including those in the domestic sector, were registered for employment in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to September this year.
Rights of domestic workers
The new regulations also stipulate that “domestic workers shall be disbursed with their wages according to the unified contract signed with the employer,” Saudi Gazette reported.
Saudi Arabia has recorded minor violations of its strict labour regulations for decades, allowing an influx of cheap labour used both by companies and as domestic workers.
Yemen, Egypt, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines all have large numbers of citizens working in the country and all rely heavily on their remittances.
According to Saudi Gazette, the new guidelines stress workers’ right to a weekly rest day agreed upon in the contract.
The provisions also include “daily rest hours of no less than eight continuous hours, in addition to a full month’s leave after completing two years of continuous work if the worker wishes to renew the work contract”.
Domestic workers also have the right to obtain a “travel ticket to his/her country every two years at the employer’s expense, an end-of-service gratuity equivalent to one month’s salary upon completing four consecutive years, and sick leave of up to 30 days per year when needed, based on an approved medical report”.
They also have the right to keep all their identification documents, such as their passport and iqama, with the employer not allowed to confiscate them.
Under the guidelines, as per Saudi Gazette, the employer is obligated to enable the worker to communicate with his family in a normal manner, issue and renew residency and legal licences at his own expense, and pay the monthly wage regularly as per the contract.
 
 

In 2008, the Human Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to improve labour law protections and end its “sponsorship” system to prevent domestic workers from being treated like slaves.
Under the “sponsorship” system, also known as the “kafala” system, foreigners in Saudi Arabia obtain a visa through their employer, who usually retains their passports, binding them to the recruiter.
In 2021, the kingdom amended the kafala system by allowing some migrant workers to leave the country without their employer’s permission.</p><small>2025-10-22 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221810064e2bd84.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950578/turkiye-pressing-for-western-fighter-jets-to-claw-back-regional-edge' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye pressing for Western fighter jets to claw back regional edge</strong></a><br><p>Anxious to bolster its air power, Turkiye has proposed to European partners and the US ways it could swiftly obtain advanced fighter jets as it seeks to make up ground on regional rivals such as Israel, sources familiar with the talks say.
NATO-member Turkiye, which has the alliance’s second-largest military, aims to leverage its best relations with the West in years to add to its ageing fleet 40 Eurofighter Typhoons, for which it inked a preliminary agreement in July, and later also US-made F-35 jets, despite Washington sanctions that currently block any deal.
Strikes by Israel — the Middle East’s most advanced military with hundreds of US-supplied F-15, F-16 and F-35 fighters — on Turkiye’s neighbours Iran and Syria, as well as on Lebanon and Qatar, unnerved Ankara in the last year.
They laid bare key vulnerabilities, prompting its push for rapid air power reinforcement to counter any potential threats and not be left exposed, officials say.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has sharply criticised Israel’s attacks on Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East, and once warm relations between the two countries have sunk to new lows.
 
 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Turkiye’s bases, rebel allies and support for the army in Syria posed a threat to Israel.
Greece, a largely symbolic but sensitive threat to Turkiye, is expected to receive a batch of advanced F-35s in the next three years.
In years past, jets from the two NATO states engaged in scattered dogfights over the Aegean, and Greece has previously expressed concerns about Turkish military build-up.
Turkiye would buy second-hand planes to get them fast
For the Typhoons, Turkiye is nearing a deal with Britain and other European countries in which it would promptly receive 12 of them, albeit used, from previous buyers Qatar and Oman to meet its immediate needs, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Eurofighter consortium members Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain would approve the second-hand sale proposal, in which they would provide Turkiye with 28 new jets in the coming years pending a final purchase agreement, the person said.
Erdogan is expected to discuss the proposal on visits to Qatar and Oman on Wednesday and Thursday, with jet numbers, pricing, and timelines the main issues.
Erdogan is then expected to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz later this month, when agreements could be sealed, sources say.
A UK government spokesperson told Reuters that a memorandum of understanding that Britain and Turkiye signed in July paves the way “for a multibillion-pound order of up to 40 aircraft,” adding: “We look forward to agreeing the final contracting details soon.”
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, who was in Ankara last week, said Berlin supported the jets purchase and later told broadcaster NTV that a deal could follow within the year.
Turkiye’s defence ministry said no final agreement had been reached and that talks with Britain were moving in a positive direction, adding that other consortium members backed the procurement. Qatar and Oman did not immediately comment.
Turkiye, US have political will to resolve issues
Acquiring the advanced F-35s has proven trickier for Ankara, which has been barred from buying them since 2020 when Washington slapped it with CAATSA sanctions over its purchase of Russian S-400 air defences.
Erdogan failed to make headway on the issue at a White House meeting with President Donald Trump last month. But Turkiye still aims to capitalise on the two leaders’ good personal ties, and Erdogan’s help in convincing Palestinian group Hamas to sign Trump’s Gaza ceasefire agreement, to eventually reach a deal.
Separate sources have said that Ankara considered proposing a plan that could have included a US presidential “waiver” to overcome the CAATSA sanctions and pave the way for an eventual resolution of the S-400 issue and F-35 purchase.
Turkiye’s possession of the S-400s remains the main obstacle to purchasing F-35s, but Ankara and Washington have publicly stated a desire to overcome this, saying the allies have the political will to do so.
The potential temporary waiver, if given, could help Ankara increase defence cooperation with Washington and possibly build sympathy in a US Congress that has been sceptical of Turkiye in the past, the sources said.
“Both sides know that resolving CAATSA needs to be done. Whether it is a presidential waiver or a congressional decision, that is up to the United States,” Harun Armagan, vice chair of foreign affairs for Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, told Reuters.
“It looks awkward with all of the other diplomacy and cooperation happening at the same time.”
Turkiye’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about floating a waiver to US counterparts or discussions on resolving the S-400 issue. The White House did not immediately comment on whether Ankara raised a waiver option.
A State Department spokesperson said Trump recognises Turkiye’s strategic importance and that “his administration is seeking creative solutions to all of these pending issues,” but did not elaborate further.
Asked about Turkiye’s separate agreement to buy 40 F-16s, an earlier generation fighter jet, a US source said that talks have been dogged by Turkish concerns about the price and desire to buy the more advanced F-35s instead.
Turkiye has developed its own stealth fighter
Frustrated by past hot-cold ties with the West and some arms embargoes, Turkiye has developed its own KAAN stealth fighter. Yet officials acknowledge it will take years before it replaces the F-16s that form the backbone of its air force.
Jet upgrades are part of a broader effort to strengthen layered air defences that also includes Turkiye’s domestic “Steel Dome” project and an expansion of long-range missile coverage.
Yanki Bagcioglu, an opposition CHP lawmaker and former Turkish Air Force brigadier general, said Turkiye must accelerate plans for KAAN, Eurofighter and F-16 jets.
“At present, our air-defence system is not at the desired level,” he said, blaming “project-management failures.”</p><small>2025-10-22 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2218131647dd157.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950475/youth-in-gujranwala-kills-aunt-accusing-her-of-blasphemy' target='_blank'><strong>Youth in Gujranwala kills aunt accusing her of blasphemy</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: A youth allegedly killed his aunt by slitting her throat at her house in People’s Colony, Gujranwala, on Tuesday, later claiming that she had “committed blasphemy” three months back.
Reports say that the suspect, Ghulam Murslaeen of Multan, arrived at the house of victim Farah (30) (sister of his father) when her two children were at school and her husband Shahzad was at work.
The suspect allegedly slit Farha’s throat with a sharp knife, leaving her dead on spot. He then came out of the house carrying the blood-stained knife and started shouting that he punished his aunt for “committing blasphemy”.
 
 

Meanwhile, locals gathered at the scene and some of them started beating the suspect with cricket bats and kicks, leaving him injured. On being called by some area residents, police reached the spot and arrested the suspect.
A team of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) also reached the spot and collected evidence from the crime scene.
The victim’s dead body was shifted to the district headquarters hospital for autopsy.
Police high-ups have constituted a special investigation team led by the Gujranwala SSP investigation to probe the incident.
Official sources say that as per the initial police investigation, the suspect stated that his aunt had visited his house in Multan around three months ago, where during some discussions, she allegedly uttered derogatory remarks against some holy figures of Islam.
The suspect also stated that he was inspired by some religious scholars, and after listening to their lectures on social media, he concluded that his aunt had committed blasphemy, following which he decided to kill her.
However, a police spokesman says that the suspect might be trying to mislead investigators through blasphemy allegations to conceal the actual motive behind the crime. He says that the case would be investigated from all aspects.
The deceased woman had been married to Shahzad of Gujranwala around 13 years ago and the couple had a son and a daughter aged 10 and 12 years.
Police have registered a case against the nominated suspect under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the report of Shahzad.
However, in the first information report (FIR) lodged with the People’s Colony police station, the alleged issue of blasphemy has not been mentioned.

Harmer took 3-26 as Pakistan ended the third day on a precarious 94-4 — just 23 runs ahead with six wickets and two days remaining on a spin-spiced Rawalpindi stadium pitch.
Pakistan’s last hopes rest on Babar Azam, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Rizwan, 16 not out, as they strive to win the two-match series, having won the first Test by 93 runs in Lahore.
South Africa piled up 404 runs after Senuran Muthusamy scored a career-best 89 not out and Kagiso Rabada posted his highest Test score of 71, giving the visitors a crucial 71-run lead.
The home team scored 333 in their first innings.
With their backs to the wall, Pakistan’s second innings started disastrously as opener Imam-ul-Haq (nine) and skipper Shan Masood (nought) fell to Harmer with the score at 16.
It became 16-3 when Rabada had Abdullah Shafique caught in the slips for six.
Harmer returned for his second spell to dismiss Saud Shakeel, who was caught in the slips for 11 to end a resolute 44-run third wicket stand.
Earlier, Asif Afridi became the oldest debutant to take a five or more wicket haul in Tests with figures of 6-79.
His effort had South Africa struggling on 221-7 as Pakistan looked set for a lead, but home skipper Masood’s decision to take the second new ball proved a big mistake.
Muthusamy played an anchor role in helping to add 169 for the last two wickets before Asif ended the innings on the stroke of tea.
Muthusamy defied the Pakistan spinners, hitting eight fours to improve on his previous highest score of 68 not out against Bangladesh at Chattogram last year.
Muthusamy added an invaluable 71 runs for the ninth wicket with Keshav Maharaj (30) and then increased the lead with a last-wicket stand worth 98.
Rabada smashed four sixes and as many fours, improving on the 47 he made against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2022.
Asif beats Marriott’s record
The morning belonged to Asif, who at 38 years and 301 days overtook England’s Charles Marriott as the oldest debutant to take five wickets.
Marriott did so against the West Indies at The Oval in 1933 aged 37 years and 332 days.
Like fellow left-armer Maharaj — who took seven wickets for the visitors in Pakistan’s 333 all out — Asif used the dry conditions to maximum effect.
With the turn on the Rawalpindi stadium pitch increasing considerably, Asif dismissed Kyle Verreynne caught behind by wicketkeeper Rizwan for 10 with the fourth ball of the day.
Tristan Stubbs defied Pakistan’s spinners for 256 minutes before a fastish delivery from Asif trapped him leg-before for 76. His knock was studded with six fours and a six.
Asif completed his five-wicket haul by trapping Harmer leg-before for two while Noman Ali dismissed Marco Jansen in the same manner for 12.</p><small>2025-10-22 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2216591463b58f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950575/fo-condemns-israels-renewed-attacks-on-gaza-calls-on-intl-community-to-intervene' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Israel’s renewed attacks on Gaza, calls on int’l community to intervene</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday condemned Israel’s renewed hostilities in Gaza, following a US-backed ceasefire agreement, calling on the international community to take “urgent and effective” measures against the violation.
Israeli forces have killed at least 87 Palestinians, among them civilians, since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and two Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinian freedom fighters in southern Gaza over the weekend, Reuters reported. On Sunday, more than 100 air strikes were reported in Rafah and Khan Younis in the south, Jabalia in the north, and other parts of central Gaza.
While Israel accuses Hamas of initiating the hostilities with an attack on its forces in Rafah, the group has denied any knowledge or connection to the incident.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, resulting in the loss of numerous civilian lives,” said a statement released by the Foreign Office (FO) today.
 






It noted that Israeli actions “run contrary to the spirit of the peace agreement signed in Sharm El-Sheikh in the presence of leadership from the Muslim and Arab world, [the] US, Europe, and the UN.”
The FO, in its statement, urged the international community to “take urgent and effective measures to end these violations and to ensure full implementation of the ceasefire and protection of Palestinian civilians.
“Reaffirming its unwavering support for the Palestinian people, Pakistan calls for an immediate end to Israeli hostilities and reiterates its principled position for the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
Pakistan was among the eight countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
Most Americans support US recognition of Palestinian state, poll shows
Most Americans — including 80 per cent of Democrats and 41pc of Republicans — think the US should recognise Palestinian statehood, a sign that Trump’s opposition to doing so is out of step with public opinion, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, found 59pc of respondents backed US recognition of a Palestinian state, while 33pc were opposed and the rest were unsure or did not answer the question.
About half of Trump’s Republicans — 53pc — opposed doing so, while 41pc of Republicans said they would support the US recognising a Palestinian state.
A growing number of countries — including US allies Britain, Canada, France and Australia — have formally recognised Palestinian statehood in recent weeks, drawing condemnation from Israel, whose founding in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and decades of conflict.
Israeli bombardments have leveled vast swaths of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza following an October 2023 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Some 60pc of poll respondents said Israel’s response in Gaza was excessive, compared to 32pc who disagreed.
Trump, who returned to the White House in January, has largely backed Israel in its offensive and this month brokered a ceasefire, raising hopes that a lasting peace could be in reach.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll gave signs that the US public was ready to give Trump credit should his plan work. Some 51pc of poll respondents agreed with a statement that Trump “deserves significant credit” if peace efforts are successful, compared with 42pc who disagreed.
 
 

While only one in 20 Democrats approve of Trump’s overall performance as president, one in four said he should get significant credit if the peace holds.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and gathered responses from 4,385 people nationwide. It had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><small>2025-10-22 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22164613acace12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950531/smog-season' target='_blank'><strong>Smog season</strong></a><br><p>AS temperatures begin to drop, smog makes an unwelcome arrival in many parts of the country, particularly Lahore and urban Punjab. This health and climate crisis has been brewing for some years, while the state — nudged on by civil society and experts — has begun to take steps to combat the smog hazard.
South Asian cities have some of the worst air on the planet, and many Pakistani urban centres are included in this unenviable list. For example, on Tuesday, both Lahore and Karachi were amongst the top five most polluted cities globally, as per IQAir monitoring data, with air quality described as “very unhealthy”. And as winter sets in, things will get worse.
 
 

In Lahore’s case, experts say a combination of local factors and pollutants blowing in from across the border with India are responsible for the dirty air. In particular, pollution caused by firecrackers set off during the Diwali celebrations in India has aggravated matters, as that country’s supreme court relaxed a ban on fireworks, allowing ‘green firecrackers’ for the occasion.
The Punjab administration has taken steps to help reduce air pollution. This includes deploying anti-smog guns as well as rounding up people responsible for emissions from factories and vehicles, and those burning crop stubble. The provincial government has also urged people to wear masks outdoors, and keep doors and windows closed. These steps were direly needed as last winter, Lahore witnessed some of the worst air quality levels on record.
It remains to be seen whether the state’s efforts result in a noticeable change in air quality. Along with such precautionary steps, it is essential to reduce emissions and encourage a switch to electric vehicles, while providing more public transport options to reduce the carbon footprint. Experts also recommend a shift to mechanical composters to address the burning of crop stubble.
While many steps are required locally and nationally, air pollution is also a transboundary issue, and a coordinated response is needed for better air across South Asia. As a senior UN official told the recently held Air We Breathe conference, organised by DawnMedia in Lahore, Pakistan cannot face the threats of air pollution and climate change alone; these are issues that require an international response.
 
 

The latest example of firecrackers set off in northern India affecting air quality in Punjab is one small example of this. While relations with our eastern neighbour may be at rock bottom, both states need to cooperate on issues such as transboundary pollution and climate change.
Clichéd as it may sound, dirty air knows no borders, and it is only through sharing data and best practices that South Asia can tackle the problem of poisonous air. In the meantime, we must do all possible locally to shield people from the acrid smog.

“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar spoke on the phone late last night with the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, H.H. Prince Faisal bin Farhan,” the FO posted on X today.
According to the FO, the two leaders “reviewed recent developments in the region, including [in] Gaza and Palestine”, building on previous discussions.
The FO further stated that both sides “reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region and agreed to stay closely engaged on matters of mutual interest”.
 






Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were among the eight Muslim countries that had
worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan both had hailed the signing of a ceasefire deal between the Israeli government and the Palestinian group Hamas, with Saudi Arabia expressing the hope that it would lead to peace after two years of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
Moreover, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, the two countries signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.

On October 18, the PML-N had posted on its official X account about a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The post said that a campus of Imperial College London would open at the Nawaz Sharif IT City, adding that the foundation stone would be laid in November.
“A modern 300-bed hospital will also be built within the college campus,” it said.
 






In a separate post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb had also made a similar statement about the meeting chaired by the chief minister.
“A campus of Imperial College London will be established in the Nawaz Sharif IT City which will also include a state-of-the-art 300-bed hospital and its foundation stone will be laid in November,” she had said. The post has since been deleted.
 

Screenshot of post made by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb on X on October 18.

The official X account for the Punjab government had also reiterated the same.
 






However, the educational institute refuted these claims, terming them “incorrect”.
“Reports that Imperial College London plans to open a campus overseas are incorrect,” the college said in a post on its official website on Monday.
“There have been erroneous reports in the media and online that Imperial is opening a campus at Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, Pakistan. Imperial has no such plans, with all the university’s campuses based in the UK,” it said.
It further directed those interested in the college’s global activity to its International Relations Office webpage.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Central Business District (CBD), a department under the provincial government set up to establish urban regeneration projects, also issued a statement, saying the planned college will be a collaboration between a trust of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and NovaCare.
“The upcoming healthcare university and affiliated medical college at CBD NSIT (Nawaz Sharif IT) is a collaborative initiative between NovaCare and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (UK) — an independent NHS institution,” it said.
The CBD added that the project “remains firmly on track under the NovaCare–ICHT partnership, advancing our mission to establish a world-class hub for healthcare education, research, and innovation at CBD NSIT, Lahore, under the direct supervision” of the Imperial College Healthcare trust.
 






Earlier, former chairman of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Javed Hassan, said that as an alumnus of Imperial College London, he was “briefly bemused by the bold claim of a campus in Nawaz Sharif IT City”.
“Turns out Imperial College is less adventurous — its campus plans remain firmly UK-bound. Verification, it seems, is still a novel concept,” he said.
 






Punjab CM Maryam had officially inaugurated the Nawaz Sharif IT City project commercially in May last year. During the ceremony, the chief minister had stated that several international tech giants were showing interest, with 10 companies already planning to establish their offices there. The IT city spans 853 acres and is designated as tax-free for 10 years.</p><small>2025-10-22 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221253124a390c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950557/aurangzeb-quite-hopeful-pakistan-can-achieve-close-to-35pc-gdp-growth-during-ongoing-fiscal-year' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb ‘quite hopeful’ Pakistan can achieve close to 3.5pc GDP growth during ongoing fiscal year</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said he is “quite hopeful” that Pakistan could manage to achieve GDP growth of close to 3.5 per cent during the ongoing fiscal year despite the impact of recent floods.
The finance czar shared this projection during an interview on CGTN America programme ‘One on One’, which was published on Tuesday. During the interview, the finance minister was asked how big a challenge the recent floods posed to economic recovery.
To that, Aurangzeb began his reply by underlining that climate change was an “existential issue for Pakistan”.
“We are living it day in and day out,” he said.
He then went on to recall previous floods and their impact, and stated:
“We grew at 3pc GDP last year. We had estimated that we would grow a little over 4pc this year, but now, given the flood situation, this will shave off a certain percentage around that. But, I am still quite hopeful that we can manage anything close to 3.5pc during this fiscal year.”
 


At the outset of the interview, the finance minister was asked about the efforts to restore Pakistan’s economy and the main challenges being faced on that front.
To that, Aurangzeb said Pakistan had “consolidated gains on the macroeconomic stability front. […] Inflation continues to be a good story, which is now in single digits. [The] policy rate has been halved. And as a result of that, what we have seen during the course of this year is [that] all global rating agencies have upgraded us during the course of this year. [It] started with Fitch, then S&P, and then two months back Moody’s upgraded us. So it is after a hiatus of two and a half or three years, we have alignment between the rating agencies.”
In reply to a question about the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb recalled that the global money lender and Pakistan had agreed upon a staff-level agreement on its loan programmes earlier this month, which would allow the country to access $1.2 billion after approval from the fund’s board.
“We are very grateful that the management of the Fund continues to repose trust and confidence in the authorities in Pakistan in terms of staying the course, especially with respect to structural reforms,” the minister said, highlighting that Pakistan had made progress in the areas of taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, privatisation and public finance.
“Privatisation was one area where we didn’t do well,” he acknowledged. But, he added, “today, we had the first asset — it’s a small bank, but it’s been on the privatisation list for a long time. It’s been nominated out to the UAE, which came in with a very successful bid. So it’s going to be handed over, and they are going to invest further in terms of increasing its footprint, taking it digital, etc.”
About the Pakistan International Airlines, he said “we are very sanguine” that it is going to be privatised before the year’s end.
“As a result of all of these developments, we have been able to return to the commercial markets,” he added. “We tapped the Middle Eastern bank borrowing again after a gap of two and a half years […] We are also now looking forward to actually printing the inaugural Panda Bond before the year is out.”
At that, Aurangzeb was asked whether Pakistan now being able to access commercial banks was a direct consequence of upgrades from rating agencies.
“Indeed,” he replied. “I keep on saying that macroeconomic stability is not an end in itself, it’s a means to an end. We repaid $500 million of Eurobond payment which was due on September 30 […] We are now clearly poised well to repay the next tranche, which is $1.3 billion, in April of next year.
“But we are refreshing our GMTN (global medium-term note) with a view to go for now a major print after the Panda bond. We haven’t decided whether it’s going to be Euro, USD or Islamic sukuk, but we will be looking for a large print during the next calendar year,” he said.
On Pakistan-China ties and what had this partnership done for Pakistan economically, Aurangzeb said, “It is a longstanding, ironclad partnership.“
The finance minister further stated that “everything that happened in the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), which was a flagship for BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) — The phase one was all about infrastructure. Now, phase two is all about monetisation of that infrastructure, using the special economic zones, etc. This is very much private sector to private sector”.
Aurangzeb then mentioned he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to  Shenzhen last year, where a number of MoUs were signed.
“The difference this time around in Beijing was that we had 24 joint venture agreements signed. So we have travelled from MoUs to JV agreements, which means there is traction now. It is going to be very much private-owned enterprises from China working with the private sector. And our role is going to be making sure that we provide the necessary ecosystem.”
Asked what was the focus of CPEC Phase II, the finance minister said, “The focus is investment — first of all, making sure that the $19 billion dollar plus trade that we have, we take it to the next level. We have an Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place, and this can now be upgraded. That’s one part of it.
“The second part of it is investments. And investments in all areas of mutual interest. It’s minerals and mining, it’s agriculture, it’s AI (artificial intelligence) and IT (information technology).”
He also underlined the potential for cooperation in the pharmaceutical sector.
“When I say pharma, I think we have a huge opportunity to get the vaccination production going in Pakistan. We saw it firsthand when the unfortunate Covid situation came in and we had to go helter-skelter finding the vaccinations.

However, the notion that rules were necessary even in times of armed conflict have ancient roots. From the ancient Vedic traditions, Sun Tzu’s ‘The Art of War’, Roman law, the Bible, and the Qur’an, all of these texts include stipulations of what is or is not allowed in war.
These norms have evolved into the contemporary law of armed conflict, which aims to spare those not directly involved in hostilities and limit the effects of violence to the amount necessary for the purpose of war.
They aim to balance the need to uphold humanitarian rules even in times of armed conflict and that of military necessity, which would allow for a party to the conflict to engage in lawful conduct in order for it to win the war. Ultimately, they seek to inject some element of humanity into the awful business that is warfare.
Cardinal Principles
Distinction
The laws of armed conflict are applied when there is a “resort to armed force between States or protracted violence between governmental authorities and organised armed groups or between such groups within a State.“ Therefore they apply to inter-state as well as civil wars.
One of the cardinal principles of the laws of war is that of distinction. This rule states that parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives. Only combatants and military objectives are to be targeted. However, there are certain caveats to the simple statement of this rule. Civilians can be targeted if they directly participate in hostilities for so long as they do so. Moreover, combatants who are injured, surrender, or become prisoners of war cannot be targeted.
 


The definition of military objective has been subject to debate. The law defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.
This generally includes armaments factories, missile depots and command centres, however, it can also include bridges if they are used to supply troops to the front line and hills if they offer a vantage point of high ground. Even hospitals can become a legitimate target if they are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, though the opposing party must give a warning before attacking a hospital.
The US’ position has been that military objectives include ‘war sustaining’ objectives as the military advantage comes from the revenues which allow them to support their military operations. This renders the US’ targeting of oil tankers and cash stockpiles in its war against Isis lawful. This interpretation has been contended and criticised. Legal scholar Marty Lederman, for instance, asks whether this approach would allow a state at war with the US to “target Apple headquarters, or various other tax-generating operations in Silicon Valley.”
Similarly, in its most recent operation in the Gaza Strip, Israel “adopts a highly unusual view” that entire apartment buildings inside which an enemy military facility is found constitute a single military objective that may be targeted. Most other militaries adopt the view that the unit itself is a military objective but the entire building is not. Therefore, there are a number of approaches that states adopt regarding the definition of military objectives which allow for a broader view of what may or may not be targeted during times of armed conflict.
Proportionality
The principle of proportionality provides that the amount of ‘collateral damage’ must be weighed against the military advantage anticipated from an attack. The law itself defines an indiscriminate attack as an “attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. A key issue with this principle is the inherent difficulty of weighing civilian life in exchange for military advantage and whether they can in fact be balanced at all.
While many human rights reports in particular simply determine an attack to be disproportionate due to the civilian lives lost, that is not an adequate way to gauge the legality or otherwise of an attack. As military lawyers have stated, “I have approved targets that could have caused 3,000 civilian casualties and I’ve raised questions about targets predicted to risk fewer than 200 civilian lives. The issue is about the importance of the target.” However, the importance of the target itself may be subjectively determined with the importance of the military advantage to be gained being overblown, thereby undermining the calculation made.
In analysing Israel’s attack on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31, 2023, in which 126 civilians died in the targeting of a Hamas commander, operatives and the tunnel network underneath the camp, Mark Lattimer notes that “the IDF appears to have accepted a level of expected civilian casualties that was not just larger but several times larger than that used by the U.S. and the U.K. in any of the operations during the war against ISIS and other counterterrorism campaigns”. He further questions Israel’s commitment to civilian protection which the principle of proportionality aims to guarantee.
Precaution
The principle of precaution requires that feasible measures be taken to ensure that civilians or civilian objects are not being attacked. If a range of options are available, for instance, in destroying a railway line, it would be preferable to destroy the line in the countryside as opposed to in the city, if this is feasible.
Additionally, the attacking state must take precautions in choosing weapons and tactics to minimise incidental injury and collateral damage and the selecting of military objectives among those giving similar military advantage expected to cause least danger to civilian lives or objects. This principle also obliges parties to endeavour to give warning if feasible to civilians who may be affected by an attack.
However, compliance with the principle of precaution does not mean that any of the other obligations (of distinction and proportionality) are lessened in any way. Israel has in the past issued warnings before air strikes through phone calls, text messages or ‘knocks on the roof. In doing so, Israel argues that it is abiding by international law. It is contended, however, that giving warnings to civilians who in practice have no means to leave may not in fact comply with this cardinal principle.
Conclusion
After the devastation wrought by recent conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, where the laws of war have been violated and war crimes have been committed, it is a worthwhile endeavour to return to the laws themselves and ask whether they are in fact fit for purpose.
While the norms underlying these rules have ancient roots, it may be that the current indeterminacy with which they are drafted, and the varying approaches to their implementation, undermine the fundamental principles they seek to protect. In order to reduce human suffering amid the clash of arms, it may be that more precise and objective rules are required.

She made the remarks as an eight-member resumed hearing over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
At the time, the PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The hearing
Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, counsel for veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, presented his arguments today.
The live stream of the hearing initially faced technical issues, with the audio being cut off. However, the issues were later resolved with proceedings being streamed as per usual. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Thursday).
 


Justice Aminuddin Khan is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Ayesha, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
At the outset of the hearing, Hosain emphasised that the judiciary’s reputation “does not depend on the 26th Constitutional Amendment”. “This case should be heard by a different independent bench,” the lawyer asserted.

Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Do you not trust this bench?”, at which the lawyer said that a decision on Article 191A — through which the CB in the apex court was introduced — should be taken by the “original full court”.
Justice Rizvi noted that Hosain’s petition did mention the term “original full court”. The counsel clarified that he did not say “this bench is not independent”.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You yourself said that the case should be kept before another independent bench. Will we judges be included in that ‘independent bench’?”
Justice Aminuddin also wondered whether CJP Yahya Afridi would be a part of that “independent bench”, to which Hosain replied that he “absolutely would be”.
Here, Justice Mandokhail questioned Hosain that if the current CB “could not hear this case, how could it issue any order?”.
The lawyer replied, “Why is the court seeking a path to issue an order? So far, the Centre has not raised any objection to a full court or [the CB] issuing any order.”
Justice Aminuddin responded that each lawyer had their own stance, and that the bench was raising questions after considering the Constitution. “Some lawyers are even saying to keep aside the Amendment,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
At one point, Justice Mazhar noted, “If 26 judges are included, then it will become a regular bench.” Hosain also agreed that it would not be a constitutional bench.
Justice Mandokhail recalled Dr Adnan Khan’s arguments from yesterday, in which he contended that the SC and the CB were separate entities. The judge then directed the lawyer to detail when the concept of benches came into existence.
When Justice Mazhar mentioned that some lawyers argued that other SC judges can also be included in the current bench, Hosain asserted that the CB was also a bench of the apex court.
Justice Ayesha then directed the counsel to read Article 191A in conjunction with its Clause 3, which says “no bench of the Supreme Court other than a Constitutional Bench shall exercise the following jurisdictions vested in the Supreme Court”, with the latter including the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184.
 
 

Justice Ayesha observed that the provision said the specified jurisdictions were to be exercised by the SC’s CB. “For some reason, we keep reading this as an ouster to say that no one else will [hear the case]. It simply says no other bench will do it.”
She further said that even if Article 191A was interpreted to mean that “no other bench” will hear such cases, it meant that the CB would hear “a case on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court” and interpret the Constitution.
“Where is the bar? […] It (the CB) is reading the provisions of the Constitution and interpreting it, and in doing that interpretation, it is saying that […] because this is a matter of a Constitutional Amendment, we interpret this to mean that a full court can hear the matter. Would that make sense?”
Justice Ayesha remarked, “I am speaking for myself; I, in the first case, said I don’t see a bar.” She added that as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is to nominate judges for the CB.
The judge termed Article 191A a “procedural” provision. She noted that while it imposes restrictions on benches, it does not on the SC, adding that the CB was interpreting the provisions as if they impose a “complete restriction”.
Justice Mazhar then expressed his “complete agreement” with Hosain’s argument that contention that a 16-member bench will be a regular bench, and not a CB.
Hosain contended, “If you say that your hands are tied, then that is not the case. Nowhere is it written that a Constitutional Bench cannot refer the matter to the full court.”
Justice Mandokhail then wondered whether the lawyer meant that the CB could not refer the case to a regular bench but could do so to a full court. “But then that will also be a regular bench. He (Hosain) said that a 16-member bench will be a regular one,” the judge added.
Hosain replied that the judges’ powers had not been taken away from them. “If, let’s suppose, the parliament tomorrow decides under a 27th amendment that an executive officer will preside over the Supreme Court, will you judges not be able to review that decision? You definitely can,” he said.
Khattak’s counsel argued that the appropriate procedure for passing the 26th Amendment had not been followed, at which Justice Mazhar said this question could be raised before the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) when arguing on the merits of the case.
At one point, Justice Hassan remarked that the lawyer was “seeking the main relief” through his current petition before the CB.
Hosain replied, “My CMA (civil miscellaneous application) does not say strike down the 26th Amendment. My CMA is very focused, which is what is before your lordships now. It is ‘please send these cases to the original full court […] and there is nothing stopping you from doing that’.”
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail wondered who would hear such a challenge if the “jurisdiction of the entire Supreme Court was taken away through any Constitutional amendment”.
“Even if the powers are taken away, the same Supreme Court will hear it,” he observed, recalling previous arguments that the current CB was not eligible to hear the case against the same 26th Amendment that led to it.
Hosain reiterated that there was no bar on the CB referring the matter to the full court, adding that he was not seeking a final decision from the current bench, but a directive to forward the case to the full court.
“Your lordships have the power. Please do not underestimate your power,” the counsel said. Hosain then concluded his arguments, following which the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
Requests for full court
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s (BHCBA) counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2213555835c1257.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950564/after-kp-cms-complaints-naqvi-says-bulletproof-vehicles-to-be-sent-to-balochistan-instead' target='_blank'><strong>After KP CM’s complaints, Naqvi says bulletproof vehicles to be sent to Balochistan instead</strong></a><br><p>After complaints by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi regarding  bulletproof vehicles provided by the federal government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that the vehicles in question would be sent to Balochistan instead.
On Monday, Afridi had blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other constitutional rights”. He had also alleged that the bulletproof cars provided by Naqvi were “defective and old”, adding that they should be recalled.
Late on Tuesday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had commented on the claims and said that like KP, his province was also affected by terrorism.
“It is an appeal to the interior minister that if the KP government is refusing to take the bulletproof vehicles, they should be transferred to the Balochistan government so that terrorism can be countered effectively,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Today, Naqvi responded to Bugti’s post and said: “CM sahib, done. These bulletproof vehicles will be sent to Balochistan immediately to enhance counter-terrorism efforts. Thank you for raising this.”
 






On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had criticised the new KP chief minister, expressing disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”. He alleged that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism “so they could use it to blackmail the government”.
Responding to Afridi’s comment on the vehicles, the minister said that it was “unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, adding that the KP government was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22122327b2289b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950551/pakistan-navy-ship-seizes-drugs-worth-nearly-1bn-in-arabian-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy ship seizes drugs worth nearly $1bn in Arabian Sea</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Wednesday from the naval network overseeing the operation.
The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16.
“The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said.
The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added.
The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated.
It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying.
“The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement that the achievement highlighted its “unwavering commitment to regional maritime security, global peace, and the collective fight against illicit trafficking at sea”.
It further said that the successful operation reaffirmed Pakistan’s “active role as a responsible maritime partner contributing to peace and security in the wider Indian Ocean region”.
The statement further said that Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended the crew for their professionalism and dedication.
“He emphasised that Pakistan Navy remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard national maritime interests while contributing to the global commons through cooperation and coordinated maritime security efforts,” it quoted him as syaing.
“The naval chief underscored that PNS Yarmook’s operation under Saudi-led task force will further enhance the interoperability between the two navies and strengthen defence collaboration between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it added.
President Asif Ali Zardari said that the achievement reflected “national pride, professional excellence, and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to regional peace and maritime security”.
 






The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons.
 






The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020.
PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously.
In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire.
In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22124602851a4c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950561/rawalpindi-atc-again-issues-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-aleema-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi ATC again issues non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, on Wednesday in a case pertaining to protests staged by the PTI in November last year over her absence from the hearing.
This is the fourth time that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Aleema in the case.
November 26 protests, as they famously came to be known as, saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”.
Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations.
Proceedings for the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station were held at the ATC in Rawalpindi today, where 10 of the 11 suspects appeared before the court. Subsequently, the ATC again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her failure to appear before the court.
The court also issued a show-cause notice to Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Saad Arshad and Deputy Superintendent of Police Naeem for filing a “bogus report”. Moreover, the court summoned them in their personal capacities over “contempt of court”.
The court remarked that the officials had said in the report that Aleema had gone into hiding. But, she was seen at the Adiala jail and also on social media channels, the court observed.
During the last hearing, the court had directed SP Saad to arrest and produce Aleema before the court on Oct 22 (today). It had also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor.
At today’s hearing, her guarantor’s surety bonds were confiscated and Aleema was directed to submit new surety bonds worth Rs1 million.
Moreover, the surety bonds of the guarantors of four vehicles linked to the case, which had been acquired from the ATC, were also confiscated. The case has been adjourned till November 24.
Previous proceedings
Today was not the first time when the court issued arrest warrants for Aleema in the case over her non-appearance.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her over her continued absence from the proceedings during the last hearing on Oct 20 as well.
Prior to that, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during the hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. It had also directed Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Oct 15.
The court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest.
The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.</p><small>2025-10-22 07:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2211500778b242a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950554/us-president-trump-says-he-spoke-to-modi-about-having-no-wars-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US President Trump says he spoke to Modi about having ‘no wars with Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”.
The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region.
Participating in a Diwali celebration at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he had a “great conversation” with Indian PM Modi over the phone.
“We talked about trade — we talked about a lot of things, but mostly the world of trade, he’s very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let’s have no wars with Pakistan,” he said.
“I think the fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that — and we have no war with Pakistan and India and that was a very, very good thing,” he said. Trump also called Modi a “great person”, saying that he had become a great friend of his over the years.
 


The US president also stated that Modi was keen to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.
“We just have a very good relationship,” he said while talking about Modi. “And he’s not gonna buy much oil from Russia; he wants to see that war end as much as I do — he wants to see the war end between Russia and Ukraine … so they’ve cut it way back and they’re continuing to cut it way back.”
Trump also lauded the US’ success in “forging peace all over the world”.
“We’re putting America first; we’re getting everybody to sort of get along,” he said, highlighting the US role in securing “total peace” in the Middle East.
“Nobody thought we’d ever see that happening,” he said. “We have levels of friendship with everybody … countries that hated each other now love each other,” he said.
Meanwhile, Modi thanked the US president for his phone call and Diwali greetings.
“On this festival of lights, may our two great democracies continue to illuminate the world with hope and stand united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said on social media platform X.
 






Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Month later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-10-22 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22110217afc20b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950550/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-as-trump-prepares-for-east-asia-trip' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Trump prepares for East Asia trip</strong></a><br><p>North Korea fired what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a week before a key Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in South Korea.
It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons.
It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea.
Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.
South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Trump to visit South Korea
Lee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea.
US officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
 
 

South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim.
Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons.
In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions.
 
 

“It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
“Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.”
Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely.
“Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said.
Multiple missiles launched
Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions, having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose.
South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said.
 
 

The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said.
Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US.
North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast.

• Evades question about ban on TLP, says action against those carrying weapons is ‘non-negotiable’
KARACHI: In a strong message, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi made it clear on Tuesday that the federal government would take decisive action against any armed group operating in the country, regardless of its location or affiliation.
He also issued a firm rebuttal to the growing perception on social media, clarifying that the federal government was not targeting any specific religious sect.
The interior minister held a meeting with leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan at the Sindh Governor House.
Governor Kamran Khan  Tessori, MQM-P Chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and senior leaders Dr Farooq Sattar and Aminul Haque lauded Mr Naqvi’s recent role in handling the law and order  situation and in upholding the writ of the state across the four  provinces.
Later, accompanied by the MQM-P leaders the interior minister told reporters at the Governor House that the ongoing actions were solely against armed groups, not peaceful religious communities.
“No one carrying weapons or operating in the form of armed jathas [groups] will be allowed to function under any circumstances,” he said when asked about the possibility of a ban on Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), without directly addressing the question. “Wherever an armed group is found — in any province — there will be action. That is non-negotiable.”
Mr Naqvi expressed “immense respect” for religious leaders, scholars and clerics, emphasising that the government’s actions were not aimed at any particular sect or group but only at those challenging the writ of the state.
“There was a perception being built on social media that the federal government is targeting a particular religious sect,” he said. “Such claims are completely false. We respect all our ulema, and this government has always stood by them. Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, and our support for religious scholars and clerics remains firm. But anyone who comes armed will, under no circumstances, be allowed to operate.”
Naqvi meets religious scholars, clerics to address reservations
Before arriving at the Governor’s House, Mr Naqvi, accompanied by Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, met prominent scholars and clerics at the residence of Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
Both sides agreed to convene a comprehensive meeting in Islamabad in the coming days to address key concerns raised by religious leaders. The scholars and clerics were assured that all legitimate and genuine issues presented by them would be addressed on a priority basis. A statement issued after the meeting said that a detailed discussion took place regarding “recent developments”, and the scholars expressed their viewpoints on various issues.
Mr Naqvi reiterated that the government remained committed to non-interference in the affairs of religious seminaries (madaris) and mosques.
 






“The government will not interfere in the affairs of madaris and mosques,” the statement quoted him as saying.
To ensure continued engagement, it was also agreed that a dedicated focal person would be appointed to maintain constant communication and coordination between the government and religious leadership, the statement added.
Other participants of the meeting included Allama Syed Muzaffar Shah, Mufti Abid Mubarak, Allama Liaqat Hussain Azhari, Allama Rehan Azhar Naumani, Mufti Rafiur Rehman Noorani, Allama Ashraf Gormani and Allama Ahmed Rabbani.

The prime minister said the initiative, to be known as INSPIRE, was “a milestone in Pakistan’s transition to a knowledge-based digital economy” and signalled its entry into the $600 billion global semiconductor ecosystem.
Under the programme, 7,200 professionals would be trained in semiconductor design and research.
Shehbaz Sharif kicked off the “initiative to nurture semiconductor professionals for industry, research & education” (INSPIRE) to mark Pakistan’s transformative step toward technological self-reliance and global competitiveness.

PM unveils ‘INSPIRE’ to train 7,200 professionals, aiming for a share in the $600bn global market

In his address, the prime minister said the launch of INSPIRE was a milestone in the country’s transition toward a knowledge-based digital economy, where innovation, research, and human capital drive sustainable growth. “Our vision is to prepare Pakistan’s youth for the industries of tomorrow… Through this initiative, we are building the foundations of a new economic frontier — one where Pakistan contributes talent, technology, and innovation to the world,” he remarked.
Assuring stakeholders of the government’s full support for this programme, the prime minister directed the execution of work at a fast pace to achieve targets.
“The planning ministry, under its Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), had allocated Rs 4.5 billion for this programme, which is just a drop in the ocean,” he said.  “Funding is no issue for this programme.”
Cashless economy
The prime minister said the government had undertaken a plan for digitisation and established the Pakistan Digital Authority as a first step.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is being completely digitised. “The government is also working to usher in a cashless economy,” Shehbaz Sharif said.
He praised the IT ministry and the PSEB for their efforts to develop a skilled workforce aligned with global industry demands. The prime minister also acknowledged the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) role in enabling strong public-private collaboration and facilitating investments that underpin national technology initiatives.
In her remarks, Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja reaffirmed the government’s commitment to developing a digitally empowered Pakistan.
Dr Naveed Sherwani, chairman of the National Semiconductor Task Force, briefed the audience on the strategic roadmap and underlined Pakistan’s opportunity to build a world-class semiconductor ecosystem.
Abu Bakar of PSEB said it was a matter of pride to have executed the semiconductor programme, which will train thousands of professionals and link academia, research, and industry to develop a sustainable national semiconductor ecosystem.
Training and research
INSPIRE aims to train 7,200 professionals over five years in semiconductor design, verification, and research. It will be engaging nine public-sector universities across Pakistan’s northern, central, and southern regions and establishing six integrated circuit (IC) labs.
As the first phase of the country’s broader National Semiconductor Develop­ment Roadmap, INSPIRE will lay the foundation for Outsourced Assembly & Testing (OSAT) and fabrication capabilities, enabling Pakistan to take part in the global semiconductor supply chain.
With the launch of INSPIRE, Pakistan has entered a new chapter of digital transformation — one defined by innovation, opportunity, and resilience.
The initiative embodies a national vision to harness youth potential, strengthen international partnerships, and position Pakistan as a credible contributor to the trillion-dollar global semiconductor industry.
Restructuring Smeda
Earlier, PM Shehbaz presided over a meeting on a restructuring plan for the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority.  He directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of small and medium enterprises to enable them to avail of business loans and stimulate industrial growth.
He said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs. He expressed satisfaction over the efforts made by the Ministry of Industries and Production for Smeda’s restructuring.

The increase in deficit is mainly the outcome of a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, except China, where Pakistan’s exports showed signs of recovery in the first three months of the current fiscal year.
A marginal increase was also recorded in exports to Sri Lanka, while shipments to Bangladesh and Afghanis­tan registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY25, Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries expanded by 29.42pc to $12.297bn compared to $9.502bn recorded during the same period last year.

Gap widens to $3.93bn in July-September

The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — dipped 5.07pc to $1.011 billion in July-September FY26 from $1.065bn over the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to nine countries rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.95pc to $4.941bn in 3MFY26 from $3.986bn over the same months of the previous fiscal year. In FY25, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China increased by 24.92pc to $4.861bn in 3MFY26 from $3.891bn over the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China totalled $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China slightly increased by 0.59pc to $562.39m in 3MFY26 from $559.07m over the same months in the preceding fiscal year. In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.

Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.95m in 3MFY26. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 compared to $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan dipped 19.83pc to $161.83m in 3MFY26 from $201.88m last year. Imports stood at $4.52m in 3MFY26 against $6.38m in FY25. Last year, Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan included sugar.
Exports to Bangladesh declined by 4.93pc to $180.15m in 3MFY26 from $189.50m over the last year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 8.32pc to $102.56m in 3MFY26 from $111.86m over the last year. The imports rose by 19.68pc $17.33m in 3MFY26 from $14.48m.
No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. Very little trade was recorded between Pakistan, the Maldives, and Nepal during the review period.

• Expects ban on party to be enforced ‘within a few days’
• ‘Due diligence under way’ on Punjab’s summary, says Talal
• Claims govt ‘making arrangements’ in light of JUI-F’s ‘possible’ march on capital
• Khawaja Asif calls for ‘hard state’ approach to curb extremism
LAHORE: Individuals providing “financial or political support” to Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) will face terrorism charges, the Punjab government warned on Tuesday, as it pressed the federal government to proscribe the group.
“Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference in Lahore on Tuesday.
She said the Punjab cabinet had forwarded a summary to the federal government seeking a ban on the TLP and expected a decision soon. “We expect the ban on TLP to be enforced within a few days,” she added.
The minister expressed regret that riots and unrest were being justified in the name of Islam and Palestine, terming it not only misleading but also a “distortion of religious sanctity”. She said false propaganda about dead bodies was carried out during TLP protests to garner public sympathy and create chaos.
Responding to rumours about the relocation of TLP founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi’s grave, the minister called it “propaganda”, but warned against using religious sites to solicit donations or fuel violence. She also clarified that no mosque was being demolished.
Ms Bokhari further claimed that 1.92 kilograms of gold were recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grams of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged.
She said the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged,” she added.
She asked parents to keep their children away from TLP’s activities and warned that terrorism charges could be filed against them as well.
“Any student involved in such activities will not be granted admission or any facilities within the country,” she said, stressing that those who took the law into their hands, responsible for the killing of an SHO and injuring 110 policemen and 148 civilians, would face terrorism cases. Ms Bokhari said Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas were being traced and would be arrested soon, adding that 95 bank accounts linked to Mr Rizvi had been frozen. “We do not want pressure groups to emerge in the country,” she said.
‘Due diligence under way’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday the government was considering a ban on TLP, confirming that the interior ministry is reviewing a reference sent by the Punjab government.
“Due diligence is under way and a final decision is yet to be taken,” he told a press conference.
Questioning the motives behind recent TLP protests, Mr Chaudhry noted the group announced a march in support of Palestine, “but none of their demands related to Palestine”. He said investigators had identified around 100 bank accounts linked to the organisation.
Accusing the TLP of double standards, he said the party publicly denounced usury while earning returns on donations deposited in these accounts. “They advise people not to use the banking system, calling it anti-Sharia, yet they themselves receive interest from the same system,” he remarked. Mr Chaudhry added that the TLP had sought a blanket boycott and ban on Israeli products, but said 69 foreign-brand watches were recovered from the residence of the group’s chief and were of “the same brands they urge others to shun”.
Warning that such “negative politics” would not be tolerated, the minister said the state had decided that extremist politics and ideology would not be allowed to take root in Pakistan. “All state institutions stand behind this decision like an iron wall,” he said.
‘Hard state’ needed
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to Geo News, said Pakistan must act as a “hard state” to curb extremism, calling groups that resort to violence “unacceptable”.
His remarks followed Punjab’s request to the Centre to ban the TLP after deadly demonstrations. However, he declined to confirm whether a formal ban was imminent, but said the state would now function strictly under the law and the Constitution.
Acknowledging decades of patronage for such groups, he added: “Everyone knows who created them and for what purpose.” Mr Asif claimed that he was unaware of any JUI-F plan to march on Islamabad, describing Maulana Fazlur Rehman as “highly respectable” and declining further comment.
However, Talal Chaudhry earlier said the government would make arrangements for any JUI-F mobilisation, stressing that Maulana Fazlur Rehman was a political and religious figure whose input the government respected.
“The government will continue efforts to bring the Maulana on board and will not allow him to be alienated,” he stressed.
The JUI-F chief, once a close ally of the PML-N and PPP, has since become a vocal critic of the coalition and rejected the post-election set-up because of alleged irregularities.
According to media reports, the JUI-F chief last week directed his party workers to prepare for a march towards Islamabad.
The announcement came during his address at the Mufti Mehmood Conference held in Dera Ismail Khan, where he delivered a strongly-worded speech expressing concern over the prevailing political situation.
