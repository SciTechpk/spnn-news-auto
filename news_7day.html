Moratinos will continue in his current role as High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), which he has held since 2019, according to a statement by the UN spokesperson’s office.
“Mr Moratinos brings decades of diplomatic experience and leadership on multilateral issues, including dialogue among civilisations and combating discrimination,” it said. “Mr Moratinos has reinforced UNAOC’s role as a global platform for dialogue and bridge-building.”
A seasoned diplomat, Moratinos served as Spain’s foreign minister from 2004 to 2010, during which his country held the presidency of the Security Council and led several international organisations, including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.
On X, Moratinos uploaded a statement expressing his gratitude and stating he was truly honoured for the appointment.
“I thank the Secretary-General for the new responsibility that I have been entrusted with. I am also grateful for the support of Member States and especially the OIC Core Group,” he wrote.
“The appointment of a UN Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia will contribute to strengthening our response to Islamophobia,” he added. “I wish to reaffirm my commitment to stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and to stand up against all forms of discrimination and bigotry.”

According to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the armed forces shot down 25 Harop drones sent by India using their “soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weaponised) skills fully”.
In a press conference earlier today, DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the drones were neutralised at various locations, including Karachi and Lahore. He also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones.
He said that the process of India sending across these Harop drones was a “serious serious provocation”. “This naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on a high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Gen Chaudhry asserted.
Harop drone is a loitering munition system, or suicide drone that flies to a target and detonates to carry out one-way missions with a high degree of autonomy, developed by the MBT Missiles Division of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).
As per information available on the IAI website, loitering munitions are designed to hover over the battlefield and attack upon the operator’s commands. The Harop is particularly known for its ability to hunt down enemy air defences and other important targets. It combines the characteristics of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and a missile, which is an airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight.
The drone can operate both fully autonomously or be manually operated in its human-in-the-loop mode. If a target is not engaged, the drone can return and land itself back at base. Harop, with its folding wings, can be launched from a truck- or ship-mounted canister, or configured for air-launch.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Dr Fahad Irfan Siddiqui, associate professor at Jamshoro’s Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, explained that Harop was a military grade technology drone. It was used for several purposes, including data collection and payload-installed attacks.
“Agri and civil survey drones have jammers installed in them, which get disconnected from their base station by blocking UHF frequencies. But for military grade drones, they are operated through satellites. It is difficult to block their radio frequency. An extremely advanced military technology can be blocked satellite by satellite (it is debatable, though),” he said.
Dr Siddiqui highlighted that the drones we were hearing of in headlines seemed to be quadcopter-type, which were difficult to detect but were not lethal.
“According to international law, any drone weighing more than 250 grams requires a license from the respective country’s civil aviation authority. Drones weighing less are generally considered toy drones and are often used for recreational purposes such as photography; these typically do not require a license,” he elaborated.
“Drones over 250 grams are subject to stricter regulations. They are prohibited from flying within a five-kilometre radius of sensitive military installations, airports, and certain government buildings — these areas are designated as no-fly zones. Moreover, the same five-kilometre buffer zone rule applies near international borders,” the professor added.
Under the International Humanitarian Law, targeting civilian sites, as India did in Pakistan, is a grave violation. The increasing use of loitering munitions and other advanced weapon systems in recent years has spurred international discussions on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS). While a universally agreed-upon definition of LAWS remains elusive, they are generally understood as weapons that can select and attack targets without direct human intervention.
Loitering munitions, especially those with autonomous capabilities like the Harop, could potentially be classified as LAWS, raising significant questions about their compliance with IHL principles.
Over the last decade, India imported military hardware worth $2.9 billion from Israel, including radars, surveillance and combat drones, and missiles, TRT Global reported.
Earlier, in 2016 and 2020, the Harop was extensively used by Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict against Armenia, per information available on the Israeli military and security export database. The attack drone supposedly hit a bus full of soldiers, killing half a dozen of them in the process, and destroying the bus.
In recent years, the drone has become an export success, with India and Azerbaijan purchasing the system. The drones were also reportedly used in Syrian conflicts, credited with the destruction of a Syrian Air Defence SA-22 Greyhound in 2018 and in an attack on the Syrian Armed Forces in December
2024. There are also indications that Turkiye may have been an early adopter of the Harop, potentially using it as early as 2005.

However, the footage dates back to October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
On Wednesday, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in overnight attacks by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
The Pakistan military termed the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory — and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
As both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
Since the breakdown in ties after the Pahalgam incident, the Indian mainstream and social media outlets have been spreading propaganda against Pakistan.
On Wednesday, an Indian user posted a video on X showing a missile strike on a residential area, claiming it depicted India attacking Pakistan. The post did not provide any other details about the alleged attack, such as the date, context or location.
The caption of the post said, “Happy Diwali, Pakistan. Indian Army – Jai Hind,” and included a hashtag of “Operation Sindoor”, the Indian military’s name for its aerial incursion.
The post quickly gained traction, amassing over 5.1 million views.
Other Indian users shared the same claim here and here, garnering over 406,000 views and 540,000 views, respectively.
The video was also circulated on Facebook here and on Instagram here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and intense public interest in the ongoing Pakistan-India military escalation.
A reverse image search conducted to investigate the video yielded a post by a user on X dated October 2, 2024, with the caption, “Iran officially declares state of war against Israel.” The post featured the same viral video.
 






Refining the search for that date yielded an October 1, 2024, YouTube video by Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan titled: “Iranian missiles targeting the Nevatim airbase in the Negev Desert”.
 


A keyword search for “Iran airstrike” and “Israel” around the corresponding date yielded an October 1, 2024, news report from Al Jazeera, titled “Iran says missiles fired at Israel in response to assassinations.”
According to the report, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian and allied leaders, including top commanders from Hezbollah and Hamas. Israeli authorities reported that around 200 ballistic missiles were fired, triggering air raid sirens and shelter warnings across several regions. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had claimed responsibility, labelling the attack a response to Israeli “crimes”. While many of the missiles were intercepted, some caused significant damage and casualties, escalating fears of further regional conflict.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows an Indian attack at an unnamed location in Pakistan amid their recent escalation is false.
The video is old from October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
Multiple claims
At the same time, iVerify Pakistan observed multiple other claims regarding the Pakistan-India escalation. Here are more claims that were debunked by the platform.


Video of Baloch people celebrating India’s strike - MISLEADING


On Wednesday, an X user, who is an Indian supporter based on their past posts, shared a video of a group of men dancing to a song, with some children joining in as well.
The caption of the post said, “Live visuals. Celebrations have started in Balochistan after India’s Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.”
The video received 2.2m views and was shared 7,400 times. The footage was shared with the same caption here, here and here.
A reverse image search of the video yielded a link to a YouTube video, dated August 15, 2023. The video has since been made private. However, the video was also shared on the uploader’s TikTok account on Aug 16, 2023.
 


The YouTuber named Azmat Baloch, with a following of 10.5K subscribers who posts videos of cultural Balochi dances on his channel, titled the clip, “Balochi lewa balochi dance.” Thus, the clip is not related to the current Pak-India escalation and does not show Baloch people celebrating Indian attacks.


Video of Pakistani anchor crying on broadcast following Indian airstrikes – FALSE


On Wednesday, a known Indian propaganda account shared a video claiming to show a Pakistani anchor breaking down in tears during a broadcast following the Indian airstrikes.
The caption of the post said: “The Pakistani anchor on Indian strike.”
The post gained 1.8m views.
The same video with the same claim was extensively shared by other users as can be seen here, here, and here.
However, a reverse image search yielded a YouTube video uploaded on April 14, 2025, by Express News titled: “Palestine Kay Masoom Logo Mujhe Muaf Krna | Anchor Farwa Waheed Bursts into Tears During Live Show”.
 


The nearly 13-minute-long clip featured the anchor bursting into tears while expressing solidarity with the people of Gaza in the wake of atrocities perpetrated by Israel in its military campaign in the territory.


Video of Indian airstrikes on Pakistan - FALSE


On Wednesday, Indian journalist Aditya Raj Kaul posted a 32-second clip showing what looked to be explosions and airstrikes.
The caption of the post said, “Breaking: Pakistan Army confirms attack by India. India has launched an attack on Pakistan. Missiles fired at Kotli, Muzaffarabad, and Bahawalpur — confirmed by DG ISPR to Pakistani journalists. India goes after the terror state Pakistan.”
The post gained 1.5m views.
The same video was shared by several Pakistani accounts as can be seen here, here and here, as well as by Indian accounts as can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here with a total of 480,500 views.
A reverse image search yielded an X post of Afghan media outlet Kabul News on October 23, 2023, showing Israel’s bombing in Gaza.
 






The video showed the same footage with the caption that said, “Israel intensified its bombing of Gaza last night. According to Palestinian media reports, 400 people, including women and children, lost their lives in last night’s bombings, and hundreds more are still trapped under collapsed buildings.”


Video showing aftermath of Indian attack on Lahore - FALSE


On Thursday, a video showing fire and thick smoke in the sky was shared on X by a user who, based on his previous posts, appeared to be a PTI supporter.
The caption of the post said: “They have reached Lahore, may God protect. The enemy is very cowardly. Attack him quickly before he tries to go to Jati Umra with evil ambition.”
The post garnered over 535,000 views.
The same video was shared by an Indian account. The post garnered over 10,000 views.
The same video also circulated on YouTube as can be seen here, here and here.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube video uploaded on August 7, 2024, titled “LPG gas tanker blast in Pakistan”.
 


A side-by-side comparison revealed identical visual elements in both videos, including the fire, thick smoke, the highway location marker and the minaret. These consistent features confirmed that the viral footage was not recent and was falsely linked to current events involving India and Pakistan.
 




Viral video of Indian jet shot down by Pakistan Air Force – FALSE


On May 7, a Pakistani user shared a video on X showing a jet being shot down by an air defence system, claiming it depicted an Indian aircraft. The post garnered over 400,000 views.
The same claim was shared by other Pakistani users as can be seen here and here.
However, a keyword search showed that neither Pakistani defence officials nor Indian authorities have released any such footage of aerial dogfights as of now.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube channel that featured videos similar to the viral clip.
The description of the channel, translated from Japanese, reads: “I enjoy casual military simulations. I sincerely thank everyone who always supports me.”
Videos similar to the viral clip can be found here, here and here.
Users in the comments of the viral videos similarly pointed out that they were fake and from a video game.

Pope Leo appeared on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica around 70 minutes after white smoke billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying that the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.
“Peace be with you all,” the new pope told the cheering crowd.
The choice of Prevost was announced by French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti with the Latin words ‘Habemus Papam’ (We have a pope) to tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter’s Square to hear the news.
Aged 69 and originally from Chicago, Prevost spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and rarely speaks in public.
 
 

Leo becomes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pope and had led the Church for 12 years and widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world.
Francis enacted a range of reforms and allowed debate on divisive issues such as women’s ordination and better inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’ vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.
Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023.
Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.
Prevost said during a 2023 Vatican press conference: “Our work is to enlarge the tent and to let everyone know they are welcome inside the Church.”</p><small>2025-05-08 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/082228385ac08de.jpg?r=011122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909458/trump-heralds-breakthrough-tariff-deal-with-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Trump heralds ‘breakthrough’ tariff deal with UK</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced a “breakthrough deal” on trade that leaves in place a 10 per cent tariff on goods imported from the UK, while Britain agreed to lower its tariffs to 1.8pc from 5.1pc and provide greater access to US goods.
The agreement announced by Trump from the Oval Office marked the first since Trump triggered a global trade war with a barrage of levies on trading partners following his return to the White House in January.
“It opens up a tremendous market for us,” Trump said.
“This is a really fantastic, historic day,” Starmer said by teleconference.
The United States has been under pressure from investors to strike deals to de-escalate its tariff war after Trump’s often chaotic policymaking upended global trade with friend and foe alike, threatening to stoke inflation and start a recession.
 






Top US officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10pc tariff on most countries, along with higher rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days.
The US has also imposed 25pc tariffs on autos, steel and aluminium, 25pc tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145pc tariffs on China. US and Chinese officials are due to hold talks in Switzerland on Saturday.
Warm relationship
With the British economy struggling to grow, the tariffs had added to the pressure on his government. Jaguar Land Rover paused its shipments to the US for a month and the government was forced to seize control of British Steel to keep it operating.
The deal will reduce US tariffs on British auto imports to 10pc from the current 27.5pc, according to a UK statement. The lower rate will apply to a quota of 100,000 British vehicles, almost the total exported to the US last year.
US tariffs on imports from the struggling UK steel industry will fall to zero from 25pc, while British tariffs on US ethanol will fall to zero from 19pc.
Both sides have agreed on new reciprocal market access on beef, with UK farmers given a tariff-free quota for 13,000 metric tonnes. There will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that Britain is expected to announce a purchase of $10 billion worth of US-assembled Boeing aircraft, although a White House graphic referred to “aircraft parts”. In turn, Lutnick said that the US will allow duty-free imports for Rolls-Royce jet engines.
Lutnick said that the deal would create $5bn in new annual export opportunities for American producers, while the new tariffs that stay in place would produce $6bn in annual new US revenue.
 






While seeking a deal with the US, Britain had refused to lower its food standards, which are closely aligned with the European Union. However, Britain’s farming trade union has said that some US producers who do not use growth hormones or antimicrobial washes could be given greater market access.
Trump said the 10pc “baseline” tariff would stay in place and that other countries may face higher reciprocal tariffs even as they negotiate similar trade deals with the US.
Details were scant on tariffs on UK pharmaceuticals imports, which could damage AstraZeneca and GSK, although a White House fact sheet said the deal would create a secure pharma supply chain.
Initial news of an announcement sent shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin up 10pc, while British retailers with operations in the US, including JD Sports and Primark owner AB Foods, also rose.
Trade tightrope
Starmer’s government has been seeking to build new trading relationships post-Brexit with the US, China and the EU without moving so far towards one bloc that it angers the others.
Economists and one FTSE 100 chief executive said the immediate economic impact of a tariff deal was likely to be limited but that trade agreements in general would help long-term growth. Britain struck a free trade agreement with India this week.
There are also domestic political risks. Polling shows the government remains deeply unpopular, making any move to cut taxes on multi-national tech companies a big risk.
Britain’s digital service tax, levied at 2pc of UK revenue for online marketplaces, would continue unchanged.
It was expected to raise about £800 million ($1.1bn) this year, but companies such as Google and Amazon have passed the cost on to customers through ad surcharges and higher selling fees, respectively.
“The American, Indian and other deals we can do will be really important to the long-term economic health of the UK, but don’t expect them to result in overnight euphoria,” the CEO said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><small>2025-05-08 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/081755532c8e15c.jpg?r=175711' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390/25-israeli-made-drones-used-by-india-in-attempt-to-attack-pakistan-all-shot-down-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>25 Israeli-made drones used by India in attempt to attack Pakistan, all shot down: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s armed forces have taken down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones sent into the country by India since last night, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.

“The Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,” the ISPR said in a press release today.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” the statement added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry admitted that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet ANI News reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan’s “air defence system”. According to the Database of Israeli Military and Security Export, the Harop is a “later development of the Harpy”.
The ministry’s statement also alleged that Pakistan had “increased the intensity” of firing at the LoC, where the two countries’ troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.
 
 

“The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,” the ANI report read.
In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.
The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.
“Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
“Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India’s drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.

During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” he continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the DG ISPR said.
“The Indians have resorted to these measures after] having miserably failed on the night of May 6 and 7, when they attacked places of worship and civilian infrastructure and killed innocent civilians, including children, women and [the] elderly,” he continued.
 


He further said: “Not only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.
“And rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.
“The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,” he said.
The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain “fully vigilant to any type of threat”.

• 13 people, including two girls, martyred in Subhan mosque strike
• Funeral of Bahawalpur victims held at Dring Stadium
LAHORE: Tensions between India and Pakistan have intensified after a series of Indian air and drone strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 Pakistani civilians, with many others injured, including 16 martyred only in Muridke and Bahawalpur.
As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore. The decea­sed were identified as Abdul Malik (from Jhang), Mohammad Alam (Samundri), and Midasar (Chunian).
Two others were injured and shif­ted to local hospitals. Sources said that the area had reportedly been evacuated earlier due to warnings of a possible strike, which helped reduce further casualties. The mosque was des­troyed and local authorities later arr­a­­­nged visits for both international and domestic media to inspect the site.
Bahawalpur
In Bahawalpur, officials confirmed that 13 civilians, including four men, seven women and two three-year-old girls, were killed in the missile strike on Subhan Mosque, located in the Chowk Azam area on the outskirts of Bahawalpur between the night of May 6 and 7.
The military’s media wing ISPR has yet to release an official list of the deceased. Most of the victims belonged to the same family, but they have yet to be officially identified.
When Dawn contacted the related government officials for the lists of the martyrs and injured, it was informed that the ISPR was finalising it before releasing it to the media.
 
 

High-level visits were conducted by Corps Commander Bahawalpur Lt Gen Aqeel, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen and Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, who met with the injured at Bahawal Victoria Hospital on directives from the Punjab chief minister.
The targeted mosque and madressah complex are located in Azam Chowk, not in Ahmedpur East as previously speculated.
The madressah premises also include residences, where most of the deceased lived and were targeted by the Indian missiles.
Dawn learnt that the private seminary during the last week had been evacuated by the local administration, apprehending any Indian assault on it. However, the residents of the seminary’s residential quarters and students were allowed to return just a day before the attack.
Witnesses reported hearing four po­­werful explosions that shook windows as far as Satellite Town and Ba­­ghdadul Jadeed Railway Station. Des­pite the panic, many residents rushed towards the blast site, chanting slogans in support of the armed forces.
 
 

Meanwhile, life went on as usual in Bahawalpur, with commercial activities in the grain, vegetable markets and local bazaars continuing on Wednesday along with the normal flow of traffic on roads.
However, public and private schools, colleges, and universities remained closed under the government’s orders.
The funeral prayers for victims were offered at Bahawalpur’s Dring Sta-dium under tight security measures.
Narowal
In Narowal’s Shakargarh sector, Indian forces launched drone and mortar shell attacks on civilian areas late Tuesday night. A government dispensary sustained partial damage, while mortar shells and drone munitions fell in surrounding fields but failed to detonate. The Pakistan Army also launched a counterattack on Indian forces. The Indian army also fired ammunition in the Harra and Sial villages.
A drone was later recovered from a tree and defused by the bomb disposal squad after being alerted by citi­­zens. Narowal Deputy Com­mis­sioner Syed Hassan Raza declared an emergency at all hospitals across the district, including BHUs, RHCs and DHQ Hospital.

Only in one unlikely case of normal circumstances and stable exchange rate at Rs280, the average base tariff would reduce by Rs2.25 per unit in fiscal year 2025-26 to Rs24.75 from prevailing rate of about Rs27 per unit.
In case of local currency depreciation to Rs300, the base tariff reduction would be around 30 paise per unit. The reduction mainly stems from lower capacity payments.
The average Power Purchase Price (PPP) would be on top of about Rs8.16 to Rs9.52 per unit fuel cost, taking the total electricity price to range between Rs34 and Rs35 per unit excluding taxes, fees, duties and surcharges.

30 paise to Rs2.25 reduction depends on rupee-dollar parity

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division has formally submitted a request for projected PPP for the next fiscal year from July 1 to determine the consumer-end tariff.
 
 

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has arranged a public hearing on May 15 to review the request in consultation with all stakeholders and give its determination for implementation by the government.
The CPPA request outlined seven scenarios developed through sensitivity analysis of key assumption parameters, specifically demand, hydrology, fuel prices, and exchange rates. Across the analysed scenarios, indigenous fuels constitute 55pc to 58pc of the overall energy mix, while clean fuels contribute between 52pc and 56pc.
The worst-case scenario — marked by a high exchange rate of Rs300, low hydrology, standard fuel prices, and normal demand — yields the highest projected PPP at Rs26.70/kWh against Rs27.
In contrast, the best-case scenario assumes normal demand and an exchange rate of Rs280, resulting in the lowest PPP at Rs24.75/kWh, primarily due to reduced capacity charges.
Electricity demand is projected to grow between 3 and 5pc in all cases, but only if the exchange rate remains stable at Rs280. The exchange rate has been assumed to be Rs300 in all six other cases. In addition, US inflation has been taken at 2pc, Pakistan inflation at 8.65pc besides 11.9pc Karachi Interbank Offe­red Rate, 4.07pc international interest rate, and transmission losses at 2.80pc.
The Nepra determination would be taken to the federal cabinet for approval and subsidy allocation, and the power division would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs be­­fore formal notification with effect from July 1 as already committed to the International Monetary Fund.

India launched a devious attack on Pakistan late on Tuesday night before the latter’s retaliation escalated the situation. But while things got serious along the border, the foreign players had a meeting with the PSL leadership.
“The foreign players met PSL chief Salman Naseer at a dinner last night and they had a ‘gup shup’ [informal chat],” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesperson Amir Mir told Dawn on Wednesday. “Naturally the current scenario may have come under discussion.
“There is no chance of the foreign players leaving the country anyway with airspace issues, but  they are living under a heavy security blanket of Pakistan Army.
“There have been surgical strikes on both sides of the border but we don’t expect that affecting the PSL. But if, God forbid, things do escalate, we will sit together to decide our next step.”
The PCB, meanwhile, did not expect the tensions to affect the ongoing PSL season, which is nearing its knockout stages.
The tournament returned to Rawalpindi with the match between Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators, with three more games to be played at the venue in the next three days while the final first-stage match of the PSL is scheduled for May 11 in Multan.
According to the PCB, the Qualifier is set to take place in Rawalpindi on May 13, while both the Eliminators and the final of the event are to be held on May 14, 16 and 18, respectively at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Wednesday that it was in touch with its players participating in the PSL.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
Speaking to a Bangladesh sports outlet, BCB president Faruque Ahmed revealed that the board is taking a wait-and-see approach and will assess the ongoing situation over the next few days before making a final call.
“We are really working on the current situation [as far as going to Pakistan for the T20I series] and it can wait for another three to four days,” said Faruque. “Let’s see how it progresses but at the moment our main concern is regarding the two players [Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain] who are currently in Pakistan competing in the PSL.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also announced that it would follow guidance from the UK Foreign Office and consult with its own security teams to assess the situation on the ground.
The board said it was in direct contact with players and will provide them with the latest security advice as the situation develops.
However, the ECB made it clear that the final decision on whether to remain in Pakistan for the tournament will rest with the individual players themselves.
“The board’s approach is to support its players with up-to-date information and expert guidance, while respecting their personal choices in light of the current regional tensions,” said the ECB.
New Zealand Cricket also released an official statement addressing the matter.
“We are aware of the relevant reports,” said NZC. “We continue to assess the security environment for our players and coaching staff in all overseas environments to ensure they’re in receipt of the most updated advice.”

“This action has been taken in light of the prevailing regional situation to safeguard national security and protect Pak­istan’s digital ecosystem,” the Pakistan Telecommuni­ca­tion Authority said, adding that the content it blocked was spre­ading misleading and harmful narratives aimed at manipulating public perception and undermining national unity.
On the other hand, IT minister Shaza Fatima said that the government foiled several cyberattacks, which she blamed on India, while an advisory by a cybersecurity body asked citizens to remain vigilant against possible cyberattacks in light of tensions with India.
Amid all this, the social media platform X, which was blocked in Feb last year, came back to life without any official word from the government, according to NetBlocks, a UK-based global internet monitor. NetBlocks said the platform was restricted by authorities in February 2024 after it was used to draw attention to instances of alleged election fraud.

Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) makes a comeback; CERT urges internet users to remain vigilant

According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima, all relevant institutions, including the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and technical wings of the IT ministry, were active and had successfully thwarted recent Indian cyberattacks. She added that not a single cyberattack from India had been allowed to succeed, and Pakistan remained vigilant to prevent any such attempts in the future.
‘Be vigilant’
In its statement, the Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) asked the public to be wary of potential cyberattacks and keep monitoring the trusted cybersecurity entities for advisories and threat alerts. “We are doing our best to counter the situation and protect our systems,” CERT said, asking the citizens to avoid clicking suspicious links, unverified messages, emails, or social media links, and use trusted sources for updates.

Rescue services have been put on high alert and a central control room established to ensure seamless monitoring and coordination.
While the armed forces ferociously responded to the attack, the Punjab government swiftly took measures to ensure public safety, announcing the immediate closure of public and private sector universities, colleges, and schools, as well as the suspension of ongoing examinations at various academic levels.
As 26 civilians have been martyred and 46 sustained injuries in Indian missile attacks, the Punjab government cancelled staff holidays and called all law-enforcement agencies officials to handle any eventuality.

Despite high alert, educational institutes  allowed to function normally; social media flooded with memes after damages to India

In line with the `War Book’ protocols, the Punjab government activated the siren and warning system and instructed the security forces to immediately secure the vital and sensitive areas across the province. It also called for identification of shelters and making them functional for civil defence. Keeping all and sundry on high alert, the Punjab government instructed the civil administration in respective districts to ensure foolproof security measures as “further hostile attacks in near future particularly targeting vital and sensitive areas cannot be ruled out.”
Meanwhile, people kept their morale high and came out on roads and intersections in several cities as well as the points of attacks in five cities and chanted slogans in support of the armed forces.
Weighing the situation after India accepted its defeat while hoisting a white flag, the Punjab government did not extend holidays in public and private educational institutions and allowed them to resume their academic and examination activities as per their notified schedules.
The examinations postponed on Wednesday will be rescheduled after completing the notified date-sheets by respective education boards and universities. Though institutions were closed, the bazaars opened and the public did shopping unhindered.
The Punjab government is, however, still on high alert. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman on Wednesday morning held a high-level video-conference meeting with administrative secretaries from all provincial departments, including the chairman of Planning and Development Board.
The chief secretary directed all provincial departments, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and police formations to maintain full readiness in accordance with the protocols outlined in the ‘War Book’.
The chief secretary was briefed about the `War Book’ protocols by the home department as he along with the IG Police and additional chief secretary visited the central control room linked with control rooms at each deputy commissioner office in respective districts in the province.
The chief secretary stressed the need to formally document all [preparedness] measures for the development of comprehensive guidelines. He instructed that control rooms in the departments of Home and the Implementation and Coordination would remain operational round-the-clock. The departments were advised to coordinate closely with the home department for any necessary support.Home Department Special Secretary Fazalur Rehman briefed the provincial top brass on the implementation of `War Book’ protocols. He stated that robust security arrangements had been put in place to safeguard critical infrastructure and ensure public safety across the province.
Briefing the meeting on ongoing security measures, IG Dr Usman Anwar asserted that the Punjab Police were on high alert and personnel had been deployed at all key locations, including border outposts to maintain heightened vigilance.
As the war had apparently subsided in a matter of hours, the public continued chanting slogans in streets and took to X handles and other social media platforms to express their humour and ran trends like ‘Sindoor bun gaya Tandoor’ and created scores of memes to enjoy the victory.

KARACHI: Although routine life in Karachi and other parts of the province remained unaffected by the Indian strikes in Azad Kashmir and Punjab, the provincial authorities on Wednesday prepared a contingency plan and beefed up security across Sindh to tackle any situation.
Almost all educational institutions remained opened on Wednesday and intermediate exams were held as per their schedule in Karachi and other parts of the province.
The director general of Rescue-1122, retired Brigadier Wajid Sibghatullah Mahar, told Dawn that the Sindh Emergency Rescue Service had prepared an emergency plan, outlining preparedness and resource allocation in anticipation of the situation.
“Rescue-1122 (Sindh) is on high alert and prepared with manpower, resources and coordination protocols to deal with any emergency efficiently,” according to the content of the plan reviewed by Dawn. “Rescue 1122 team stands fully ready to respond to any emergency across the province.”
The Sindh health department also declared “emergency” in all health facilities due to the prevailing regional security situation.
According to a communique issued by the director general-health, all leaves of health personnel, including doctors and nurses, stand cancelled. The health authorities were asked to maintain close coordination with Rescue-1122, district administration and law enforcement agencies.
According to the contingency plan, ambulances are fully integrated with Rescue-1122, operating to respond  promptly to any medical emergency that may arise.
The plan has been shared with all relevant district administrations for their information and necessary action.
Police on alert
Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday ordered the provincial police to remain alert at all levels in view of the tense situation at the country’s borders, according to an official statement.
He directed policemen to keep a close watch on bazaars, markets and public places and enhanced monitoring and checking at the bordering towns and important installations.
“The Pakistan army, air force and navy are extremely alert at the borders while the Sindh police are alert against the enemies inside the province,” declared the IG police.
Also, Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho chaired a meeting at his office in view of the current situation.
The metropolis police chief ordered the city police to remain alert and present at their headquarters while leaves of all policemen had been cancelled, according to the police statement. He said monitoring of all important installations should be increased.

ISLAMABAD: Amid escalating tensions, the Indian chargé d’affaires was summoned to the foreign ministry on Wednesday to receive a strong protest over the unprovoked Indian strikes at multiple locations across Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. These strikes resulted in the deaths and injuries of several civilians, including women and children.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that India’s blatant act of aggression constitutes a clear violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. The statement emphasised that such actions contravene the UN Charter, international law, and established norms governing inter-state relations.
Pakistan firmly rejected India’s baseless justifications for its hostile actions. The Indian side was warned that such reckless behaviour poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar briefed the Isla­­­mabad-based ambassadors on the Indian strikes in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir.
According to the FO, Mr Dar st­­ro­­ngly condemned the Indian ag­­gression that not only violated Pakistan’s sovereignty but also jeo­­pardised regional peace and stability. He also discussed the regional security situation following the Indian strikes with the ambassadors and ministers of China, Turkiye and Italy.
Ambassador of China to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong called on FM Ishaq Dar and discussed the current situation following India’s aggression against Pakistan.

• Lawmakers laud forces on successful defence of the realm
ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in the National Assembly on Wednesday stro­ngly condemned the brutal aggression demonstrated by India resulting in loss of civilian lives in Pakistan.
In an impassioned speech on the floor of the lower house of parliament, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said: “Only thieves and cowards attack at night. If they had even an ounce of courage, they would have announced their attack during the day.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that India has become barbaric and blind due to its arrogance, but the valiant people of Pakistan will make them see. “We do not condone war and never have, but India should brace itself because Pakistan is yet to respond, and it will not do so during the night, or on the basis of lies, but as per international laws and UN Charter.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in his address in the National Assembly, called for a complete unity and offered to meet political leaders, including those from the opposition PTI.
He said the great victory of Pakistan and frustration of the evil designs of the enemy was made possible by unity, concord and consultations.
Inviting all political forces to join hands to seize the opportunity of making Pakistan a great nation, he said he was ready to meet them in the speaker’s chamber. “We should peek into the past to learn a lesson from it, and not to sling mud at each other,” he remarked.
The prime minister said Pakistan delivered a befitting response to India, shattering the myth that the hostile neighbour has left Islamabad far behind in conventional warfare. He emphasised that Pakistan is fully capable of defending its geographical boundaries, whether in conventional or nuclear warfare. He reaffirmed the competence of the country’s armed forces in defending the motherland.
“We should pass a resolution to pay tributes to General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, General Syed Asim Munir, Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar for doubling nation’s honour,” he remarked.
Expressing his views on the floor of the house, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer of talks with the opposition.
“It is a moment when politics takes a back seat to patriotism. This country belongs to all of us. Today, politics has been silenced, but on both sides of the aisle, the whole nation is united for Pakistan’s defence,” said Gohar.
He warned India against any repeat of the mistake it had committed.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, expressing his views in parliament, said clear instructions were given to the forces to engage only those aircraft that drop payloads inside Pakistani territory. “Otherwise, we could have brought down 10 to 12,” he said. “India’s reckless attack has jeopardised regional peace,” he noted.
He said that Pakistan reserves the right to respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter.
JUI-F’s Ghafoor Haideri and MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui also hailed the befitting response to Indian aggression while expressing their views in the house.

According to PAA, some airspace, particularly sections over Lahore, will  rem­ain closed for another 24 hours due to “operational reasons,” a  revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) said.
The NOTAM specified that  certain airspace sections over Lahore would be temporarily  unavailable at all altitudes from 10:50am on May 7, until 12:20pm on May  9, while flights taking off from or landing at Islamabad International Airport  were directed to contact Air Traffic Control (ATC) for clearance.
The PAA  said in a statement that it has formally conveyed its concerns to the  International Civil Avi­ation Orga­n­isation (ICAO) “rega­rding the seri­ous  risks posed to civil aviation safety by India’s rec­kless and provocative  actions.” This followed an earlier complete closure of Pakistan’s  airspace for 48 hours after a military confrontation with India on  Tuesday night.
While the PAA issued a revised  NOTAM later on Wednesday, stating that airs­pace in Islamabad, Rawa­­l­pindi, and Karachi was fully  restored, it reiterated the Lahore restrictions.
A CAA spokesman told Dawn that  “only a few routes between Lahore and Islamabad will remain closed, but  other routes between the two cities would remain functional.”
The  PAA also stated that all airports across Pakistan “will remain fully  operational,” adding the country’s airspace “continues to be open and  secure for civil aviation activities.”
Indian airports closed
The airports in India’s north will remain closed till 5:29am on May 10, as per the NOTAM issued to airlines, accessed by The Hindu. The airports span Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Leh, and States of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. This resulted in a large number of flight cancellations by Indian airlines operating domestic routes.
These include airports at Jammu and Srinagar in J&K and Leh; Amritsar, Chandigarh, Patiala, Halwara airports in Punjab; Shimla and Dharamshala in Him­achal Pradesh; Jodhpur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Kishangarh in Rajasthan; and Bhuj, Jamn­agar, Rajkot, Mundra, Porbandar, Kandla, Keshod, and Bhuj in Gujarat, as per a NOTAM issued by the Airports Authority of India.
Additional airports impacted were Gwalior and Hindon, according to information posted by airlines on X. Many of these airports are used jointly by airlines and the Indian Air Force.
International flights were among those affected by the escalated military tensions between India and Pakistan, including those of US carriers, as they couldn’t use Pakistan’s airspace to enter into India.

According to the Indian Express, Indian Home Min­ister Amit Shah chai­red a security review meeting via video conferencing on Wedn­esday after­noon with the Lieutenant Governors of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Uttara­khand, Punjab, Rajas­than, Gujarat and West Bengal, and a representative from the Sikkim government.
“All states should make their preparations as per the guidelines issued for the mock drill. Arrang­ements should be made for smooth operation of essential services like hospitals, fire brigade etc. and uninterrupted supply of essential goods should be ensured,” said Home Minister Shah in a statement.
“Strict vigil should be kept on anti-national propaganda by unwanted elements on social and other media platforms and prompt action should be taken in coordination with state governments and central agencies. Every effort should be made to maintain seamless communication and the security of vulnerable points should also be further strengthened,” he said, adding that he also asked the states to stop the spread of fear among the people of India.
He also asked the states to keep disaster response forces, civil defence, Home Guards and NCC on alert. “Efforts should be made to ensure public participation through citizens and non-governmental organisations. Coordination between the local administration, army and paramilitary forces should be further enhanced,” he said. Senior officials of the home ministry, including the Union Home Secretary, IB director, DGs of BSF and Central Industrial Security Force were also present at the security review meeting.
“All the senior officials of the paramilitary forces were asked to strengthen border outposts to cover prominent routes and stop infiltration,” an official said, adding that the DGs said they had called back personnel on leave and instructed all personnel to ensure necessary precautions and appropriate arrangements to handle any potential contingency.
Another official said the Sashastra Seema Bal has been asked to ensure security on the borders with Nepal and Bhutan.

• NSC authorises military to act at ‘time, place, and manner of its choosing’
• Forum terms blatant violation of sovereignty, territorial integrity ‘act of war’
• Apex committee warns India ‘has once again ignited an inferno’
• Two cabinet members hint at lowering of tensions if India avoids further escalation
ISLAMABAD: PM Shehbaz Sharif declared that Pakistan has decided to avenge the overnight incursion as the National Security Comm­ittee — the apex security forum — authorised the armed forces to undertake corresponding actions in self-defence at a time, place, and manner of its choosing.
India conducted several strikes inside Pakistan, including in Azad Kashmir, early on Wednesday. Pakistan respo­nded swiftly and downed “five jets” of the Indian air force, immediately forcing them to retreat.
As the fear of an India-Pakistan war loomed large, PM Shehbaz convened a meeting of the National Security Committee to review grave developments arising out of India’s unprovoked and unlawful act of war. This meeting took key decisions, which it shared in a statement, followed by the premier’s address to the nation.
In his speech, PM Shehbaz said India attacked six different places in Pakistan and expressed sorrow over the loss of innocent lives. “We solemnly swear that we will avenge each and every drop of blood of our martyrs,” he said, adding that India targeted innocent people in Pakistan.
India has made a blatant mistake and now it will have to bear the consequences, said the premier, adding Pakistan has proved that it was capable of responding to any sort of aggression in a befitting manner. “India thought that Pakistan would retreat, but it forgot that we are a brave nation ready to fight till the last drop of our blood,” he added.  He said it “took only a few hours” for the Pakistani military to bring the enemy to its knees. “With the grace of God, our jets created such a storm in the sky that the enemy screamed. Five war jets, which were the pride of India, are now just ash and rubble.”
PM Shehbaz has said that Pakistan and its military forces have once again “proved their superiority over the enemy in conventional warfare”.
‘Coordinated missile, air and drone strikes’
A statement issued by the NSC after its meeting said Indian jets “deliberately targeted the civilian areas, on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children, and causing damage to the civilian infrastructure, including mosques”. It said the Indian strikes also caused “grave danger to commercial airlines” in the air, endangering the lives of thousands. The statement also expressed concern over the targeting of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project, which was a violation of international conventions.
The NSC said the blatant violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity clearly constituted acts of war under international law.
Pakistan has been emphatically rejecting Indian allegations claiming the presence of terrorist camps on its territory, the statement said, recalling Pakistan had offered a transparent and neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack but its offer was not accepted.
“The international media personnel had already visited these ‘imaginary terrorist camps’ on 6 May 2025, and more visits were planned for 7 May, 2025. However, apprehensive of its falsehood being exposed…the Indian leadership…has now gone to the extent of attacking innocent civilians in order to satiate its delusional thoughts and short-sighted political objectives,” the statement said, adding that the attack on innocent people “was neither tolerable nor acceptable”.
“India, against all sanity and rationality has once again ignited an inferno in the reg­ion; the responsibility for ensuing consequences shall lie squ­arely with India,” it warned.
“In consonance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defence, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty,” it said.
Reconciliatory note
As tensions boil over, two cabinet members struck a reconciliatory note, with PML-N stalwart and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah saying that the government and the army chief had committed to the world that Pakistan would not take any “irresponsible action” if India did not further escalate.
“We have given a befitting response. If they (India) do further actions, then we will give an even more befitting response,” he said after the NSC meeting. His colleague Khawaja Asif also appeared cautious in his response, saying Pakistan was “trying to avoid” a full-blown war.
Speaking to CNN, Defence Minister Asif said New Delhi’s deadly barrage on Punjab and Azad Kashmir was a “clear-cut violation” as India crossed an international boundary. “This is a clear-cut violation, and an invitation to expand the conflict and maybe convert it into something much more wider and much more dangerous for the region.” He insisted that Pakistan’s military was braced “for an all-out war,” after India raised the “stakes”.
“What happens next is we are prepared for an all-out war. There is absolutely no doubt, because India is inc­r­easing the intensity, the stakes of this conflict,” added Kh Asif. “So… we can’t be caught with our guards down.”

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday mourned the loss of 31 lives in attacks by Indian forces on civilians, terming New Delhi’s actions “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
Despite a ramping up of rhetoric from the Indian side, diplomatic channels remained open, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed contact between the national security advisers of India and Pakistan, and US President Donald Trump urged both sides to stop the violence.
“I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will. I will be there,” he said.
The Pakistan military touted the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory — a claim which was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes on six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
The military’s chief spokesperson said that at least 57 people had been injured in the attacks, while a hydropower project was also shelled by Indian forces.
Muzaffarabad Deputy Commissioner Mudasser Farooq said the intake structure of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP) was targeted the previous night, which damaged the intake gates and a hydraulic protection unit. An ambulance belonging to the project was also hit.
Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as per the Geneva Conventions, it was prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects that were indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as drinking water supplies/installations and irrigation works.
Trump’s plea & NSAs’ chat
Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to halt their fighting immediately, and offe­red to help end the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in two decades. “It’s so terrible,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “I get along with both, I know both very well, and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop.
“They’ve gone tit-for-tat, so hopefully they can stop now, but I know both. We get along with both countries very well, good relationships with both, and I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will. I will be there,” he said.
Meanwhile, in an interview to TRT World, Foreign Min­ister Ishaq Dar confirmed that the national security advisers of India and Pakis­tan had been in touch. Mr Dar was questio­n­­ed about whether the NSAs had spoken after the overnight action, to which he said: “Yes there has been contact between the two.”
Pakistan had recently named ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik as the NSA, while his counterpart from India is Ajit Doval. Earlier, NDTV quoted Do­­val as telling his foreign counterparts that India has no in­­tention to escalate. How­ever, other voices in the Indian government seemed to contradict his sentiment.

Indian ‘operation’ and ‘crashes’
According to New Delhi, its strikes targeted “terrorist camps” that served as rec­ruitment centres, launchpads, and indoctrination centres, and housed weapons and training facilities. “Intelligence and monitoring of Pakistan-based terror modules showed that further attacks against India were impending, therefore it was necessary to take pre-emptive and precautionary strikes,” Indian Foreign Sec­retary Vikram Misri, the top official in its external affairs ministry, told the briefing.
Pakistan claimed to have shot down at least three Rafale fighters, and two Russian-made fighter jets during engagements.
Although India did not confirm Pakistan’s claim of shooting down five of its jets, local government sources in Indian-held Kashmir told Reuters that three fighter jets had crashed in separate areas during the night.
All three pilots had been hospitalised, the sources added. Indian defence ministry officials were not immediately available to confirm the report.
Images circulating on local media showed a large, damaged cylindrical chunk of silver-coloured metal lying in a field at one of the crash sites.
Meanwhile, CNN quoted a French security official as saying that at least one of the dow­ned aircraft was, in fact, a Rafale aircraft.
Preparations in AJK, held Kashmir
Meanwhile, preventive me­­asures were taken along the Line of Control on Wednesday, as the AJK government on Wednesday established a Cen­tral Emergency Response Cen­­tre to coordinate rescue, relief, and damage assessment efforts.
Officials in Muzaffarabad, Haveli, Poonch, and Kotli noted that a precise evaluation of property losses was still underway. As part of the emergency measu­r­­es, all educational institutions across the region were ordered closed until further notice.
In Muzaffarabad’s Shawai area, a mosque struck by missiles — killing three people, including its 80-year-old caretaker — remained the focus of high-profile visits throughout the day.
Among the visitors were members of the United Nations Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), who were briefed by military officials on the unprovoked Indian attack.
Deputy Commissioner Faro­­oq said many residents had been evacuated from Shawai overnight and returned home by the afternoon. Residents who lived near the mosque shared harrowing accounts of the attack.
“At first, we had no idea what was happening. My daughter and I had just stepped into the veranda when she was struck by shrapnel. We immediately ran for cover,” said Safeer Awan, a lawyer whose house is located just metres from the mosque.
Erdogan conveys solidarity
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken by phone with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to convey his solidarity after Indian strikes, Reuters reported.
During the call, Mr Erdogan told the premier that Turkiye supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies” in the crisis, his office said in a statement.
Mr Erdogan also described Islamabad’s call for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack as “appropriate”.
Meanwhile, the UN has renewed its call for “maximum restraint”, APP reported. Responding to questions at a news briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay reiterated that the world cannot afford a military confrontation between the two nations.
Asked whether the UN personnel serving the United Nations Observer Group in India and Pakistan, which monitors the Line of Control, were safe, she said, “Yes, we checked and everybody was safe.”

The case pertains to the military trials and the subsequent sentencing of civilians for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The 5-2 ruling came as the CB accepted a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover­nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the widely-praised October 2023 ruling that declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts violated the Constitution.

Highlights:

SC restores three provisions of Army Act struck down earlier
Bench orders legislation within 45 days to ensure civilians’ right to appeal

Minority ruling declares military court sentences as ‘without jurisdiction’, against Constitution

Lawyers, PTI slam ruling, voice concern over fair trial


The bench — led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan — had been reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts was Constitutional or not.
Justice Aminuddin announced the 10-page short order of the majority ruling. The bench also directed the government to make the necessary amendments in the PAA within 45 days to allow the convicted individuals the right to appeal their sentences before a high court.
On the other hand, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan dissented from the verdict, dismissing the appeals in a separate order and upholding the earlier ruling that declared military trials as null and void.
 
 

That Oct 23, 2023 verdict by a five-member bench — led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan and comprising Justices Munib Akhtar, Yayha Afridi, Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ayesha A. Malik — had declared the military trials of civilians as unconstitutional by a majority of 4-1.
While the bench unanimously emphasised that the cases of the May 9 suspects will proceed before criminal courts, the majority ruling had struck down Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) as well as Section 59(4) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952.
In today’s pivotal verdict, the constitutional bench — formed under the 26th Amendment — restored those sections of the PAA.
Section 2(1)(d)(i) says that those persons not otherwise subject to PAA become subject to the law if they were accused of seducing or attempting to seduce any army officer from his duty or allegiance to the government.
Likewise, Section 2(1)(d)(ii) says individuals could be tried under PAA if they have committed an offence in relation to any work of defence, arsenal, naval, military or air force establishment or station, ship or aircraft or otherwise in relation to the naval, military or air force affairs of Pakistan an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1923.
Section 59(4) says that any person who becomes subject to PAA will liable to be tried under this act.
The short order stated that by a majority of five judges, “ICA no.5/2023 and other connected appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment, dated 23.10.2023, […] is set aside.
“Whereas, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan dismissed the aforesaid intra-court appeals,” it added.
While the CB did not specify a timeframe, a detailed verdict is expected later as only short orders were issued today.
‘Rights struck a death blow’: Lawyers, PTI slam ruling
The PTI — whose supporters and activists are among those handed the sentences by military courts — and lawyers strongly criticised the verdict and expressed their concerns about the right to fair trial.
Lawyer Reema Omer termed the order “terrible”. “A pity the highest court of the land is on board with such militarisation of justice in the country,” she said on X.
Noting the court’s directives on legislation about right to fair trial, Omer said: “While important, [it is] insufficient to make military trials of civilians consistent with fair trial.”
She highlighted that the dissenting order clearly pointed out “how military trials of civilians violate the right to a fair trial in a number of ways, and why active military officers are not competent per se to conduct indepedent and impartial trials”.
 


In another post, Omer shared an analysis by the International Commission of Jurists that detailed why military trials “reflect a glaring surrender of human rights”.
Renowned rights activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir also strongly condemned the verdict, saying it had “surrendered our fundamental right to due process and fair trial”.
“Last night we faced an external threat from a foreign enemy. This morning we have been exposed to an internal threat to our democracy and freedom by our own Supreme Court,” he quipped, referring to the India-Pakistan military escalation.
Nasir affirmed: “While we stand with our armed forces to protect our borders, we in the midst of this crisis and wartime hysteria must not lose sight of the very constitutional rights and freedoms which we are fighting to protect.”
 


Lawyer Hassan A. Niazi lamented: “Pakistan’s fundamental rights — battered and waning — were struck a death blow today. Even the judicial arm cedes its space.”
The lawyer added that the dircetives on right to appeal could not “redeem the fact that civilian trials in military courts are unconstitutional and violate basic human rights”.
“We have entered the era of ‘militarisation’ of justice — spearheaded by a ’constitutional bench,” he said.
 


PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed the ruling a “weaponised decision” that he said “would be used for targeting” Imran and his party.
“The decision has been given on a day when purportedly the installed regime and the establishment want to build ‘National Cohesion’,” he added, referring to the ongoing situation faced by the country in the wake of India’s strikes last night.
“The judges who have ruled in favour of allowing civilians trial in military courts will not be remembered kindly by history,” the NA opposition leader said, adding that the 26th Amendment was passed with “ill intent” and Imran as the “sole target”.
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh mentioned the timing of the verdict, saying, “Dropping the military courts verdict amid a war-like situation is a deliberate move to mask injustice.”
 


PTI’s Hammad Azhar said it was “despicable to use hostilities on the border to encroach on civilian rights and trample the Constitution”.
“Weak leaders use conflicts for personal branding whilst statesmen see it as [an] opportunity to unite the country,” he added.
Majority ruling
Detailing the reasons briefly, the majority order stated: “There was, in fact, no question with regard to the suspension of any fundamental right involved within the sphere of influence or realm of Article 233 of the Constitution.”
Recalling the arguments presented by Attorney General of Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, the order noted that 39 military installations, army works/establishments at various places were targeted/attacked “within a span of four to six hours”.
 
 

“Peaceful assembly, association, or public demonstration/protest within the bounds and precincts of reasonable restrictions imposed by the law is not prohibited, but without violating or breaking the law, or taking the law in one’s hands,” the ruling stressed.
It noted that the AGP had pointed out that due to the striking down of some sections of the PAA, no action can be taken even against “hardcore criminals and terrorists” involved in attacks on army installations, personnel or civilians, or against “persons accused of espionage or spies of enemy countries”.
Citing the cases of Brig (retired) F. B. Ali, Shahida Zahir Abbasi and District Bar Rawalpindi, the bench noted that the “various provisions were vigorously highlighted by the learned counsel for the appellants to demonstrate” that the right to a fair trial was fully protected under the PAA.
On the right to appeal, the order said that AGP Awan had reiterated that if the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament to amend the law and create a window of an independent right of appeal over and above the one already provided under Section 133-B of the PAA, it would be considered seriously.
Subsequently, the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament for “considering and making necessary amendments/legislation” in the PAA and allied Rules within 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the high court against the convictions handed by military courts under Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) read with Section 59(4) of the PAA.
 
 

It clarified that individual cases/writ petitions before high courts challenging ATC orders, “allowing the transfer of case/custody of any accused to the military court for trial, shall be decided by such courts on its own merits”.
“In our view, the provisions merely accentuating the right to a fair trial and due process in any statute and its actual application and proper implementation during the trial are two distinct features and situations,” the order stated.
The majority ruling further said: “We, in unison, sensitise the need for legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.”
Minority ruling disagrees with military trials
In their dissenting order, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan set aside the convictions and sentences awarded to civilians by military courts over the May 9 riots, declaring them as “without jurisdiction”.
The judges observed that the trial of civilians by military courts violated Articles 2A, 9 (security of person), 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention), 10A (right to fair trial), 19A (right to information), 25 (equality of citizens) and 227(1) (provisions relating to the Holy Quran and Sunnah) of the Constitution, as well as “offends the fundamental principle of independence of judiciary”.
 
 

They determined: “The accused under custody shall be treated as under-trial prisoners. Their cases stand transferred to the concerned courts of competent jurisdiction for trial. Upon receipt whereof, the concerned courts should proceed with their trials expeditiously and decide the same at the earliest, in accordance with law.”
The judges were of the opinion that suspects “who have completed/undergone their sentences or have been acquitted of the charge by the court martial or forum of appeal under the PAA shall have the effect of their discharge” under section 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The order pointed out that Section 2(1)(d) did not “qualify for exemption
from fundamental rights” as it related to “persons not otherwise subject to the PAA (‘Civilians’)”, and hence, cannot be retained as part of the PAA .
“The courts martial comprising of executive, being outside the scope of Article 175(3) of the Constitution, cannot prosecute civilians,” the judges observed.
They clarified that the reasons for their judgment would be detailed “later on”.
Military court convictions
On December 13, 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of 85 civilians who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
 
 

Subsequently, on December 21, military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another 60 civilians were handed jail terms for a similar period over the matter.
On January 2, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.
The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the PTI, but the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p><small>2025-05-07 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/071744432353454.jpg?r=174533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909144/hbl-psl-2025-to-continue-as-per-schedule-amid-escalating-regional-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025 to continue as per schedule amid escalating regional tensions</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed on Wednesday that the HBL Pakistan Super League 2025 will continue as per schedule, amid escalating regional tensions.
The statement comes hours after the Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by the neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“HBL Pakistan Super League X will continue as planned with Islamabad United set to take on Quetta Gladiators later today at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium,” the PCB said in a press release issued on Wednesday morning.
The statement added that the toss for today will take place at 7:30pm, with the first ball to be bowled at 8pm.
The tenth edition of the HBL PSL started on April 17. This year’s event marks a decade of the country’s very own franchise T20 tournament, which has over the years attracted sizeable crowds stadiums as well as a dedicated online viewership.
Tonight’s match sees the return of HBL PSL to Rawalpindi for four matches on  May 7, 8, 9 and 10. Thereafter, the final group stage match is scheduled in Multan on May 11, the PCB added.
The Qualifier is set to take place in Rawalpindi on May 13, while both Eliminators (1 and 2) and the final of the marquee event are to take place on May 14, 16 and 18, respectively, at the Gaddafi Stadium.
The last PSL match before a day’s break on May 6 was played between Multan Sultans and Peshawar Zalmi at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Monday.
It was a game reflective of the dismal campaign the home side has had. The Multan side couldn’t muster any strength to stave away Peshawar ; overrun by Babar Azam’s side, who hauled themselves firmly into PSL playoffs contention with a clinical seven-wicket victory.</p><small>2025-05-07 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/07113017a4e1b5f.jpg?r=122835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909071/psx-bleeds-as-fears-of-indian-military-action-come-true' target='_blank'><strong>PSX bleeds as fears of Indian military action come true</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday witnessed yet another bloodbath this year — tumbling by over 3,500 points — as investors’ fears of a military action by India against Pakistan came true last night.
The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 6,560.82 points (5.78pc) to stand at 107,007.68 from the last close of 113,568.50 when the market opened at 9:30am.
Due to the massive dip, the market was immediately suspended briefly.
This marked the second-largest intra-day plunge (points-wise), ranking next to the nearly 8,700-point loss that followed the United States’ tariff announcement last month.
However, the market started recovering slightly, reaching 112,457.37 points at around 10:34am, before closing at 110,009.02 points — 3,559.48 points (3.13pc) below yesterday’s close.
“The market opened under pressure today following Indian strikes on unarmed civilians in Pakistan,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.
 
 

“Some selling has been observed, though volumes remain low as investors assess the evolving situation,” Farooq said, adding that recovery was expected once tensions begin to de-escalate.
Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Frim Ventures, also attributed the sell-off to “heightened geopolitical tensions following reports of Indian strikes on multiple Pakistani locations”.
“The flare-up has rattled investor sentiment, with fears of further escalation weighing on the market,” he said. However, Shahbaz added, analysts remained “cautiously optimistic, hoping the conflict will remain short-lived with likely mediation from global powers”.
“Importantly, with macroeconomic indicators showing signs of recovery, market watchers believe this correction could be temporary. Many view the pullback as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate quality stocks at lower valuations,” he noted, explaining the gains witnessed later.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the impact of today’s selling pressure would be short-term and the market would “recover once this ends”.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also observed that the PSX was “feeling the impact” of last night’s developments.
Echoing Shahbaz’s opinion, Awais said the plunge “may present a buying opportunity, as we do not expect the situation to escalate further”.
“The conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated dangerously,” said Sakib Sherani, economist and head of Macro Economic Insights, adding that India’s request to the International Monetary Fund earlier this week to review loans disbursed to Pakistan was adding to Islamabad’s woes.
 
 

“All these actions will hurt Pakistan’s fragile economic recovery.”
“Reports of the IMF programme being affected purely because of representations by one country on the board of the IMF are overblown,” said former State Bank of Pakistan chief, Reza Baqir.
“A longer-term conflict is in neither country’s interest,” he stressed.
In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to reduce their holdings as Pakistan had expressed a heightened possibility of a military action by India in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
International rating agency Moody’s has warned that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.
It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.
On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.
 
 

“The reliance of Pakistan on external capital inflow — in recovery from an external account crisis, in the midst of an IMF programme, and with under three months of import cover compared to over nine months in India — makes its asset prices much more sensitive to any conflict than those in India,” said Hasnain Malik at Tellimer in Dubai, Reuters reported.
Pakistan’s finance ministry said it had held an emergency meeting to review market resilience and national financial security, adding that robust measures to safeguard economic infrastructure and provide clarity and confidence to markets are being implemented.
India’s equity benchmarks end little changed
Meanwhile, India’s equity benchmarks ended with little change, coming off early losses, as rising geopolitical tension between India and Pakistan offset expectations of easing global trade tensions.
The benchmark Nifty 50 and Sensex closed 0.1pc higher each at 24,414.4 and 80,746.78, respectively. The 50-stock index had opened 0.6pc lower, while the Sensex had slipped 0.9pc at open.
Eleven of the 13 major sectors logged gains.
 
 

Volatility in Indian shares .NIFVIX, which has risen in eight out of the 10 trading sessions since the Pahalgam attack, was hovering near a three-week high.
India’s top two stock exchanges, the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange temporarily restricted access to their websites for overseas users, Reuters reported, citing sources.
However, the ability of overseas investors to trade on Indian markets remained unaffected.
“Investors were taking short positions in the market in anticipation of an Indian retaliation. Now that the news is out, they are covering those positions,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of equity research at Cholamandalam Securities.</p><small>2025-05-07 13:03</small></div><hr>
